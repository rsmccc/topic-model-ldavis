         <p>IGA STORE SUFFERS FIRE LOSS
L D Anderson s IGA store suffered
a serious fire loss last Sunday
morning The Hagen clothing store 
next door was badly smoke damaged 
The alarm was turned in about 1 30
a m when Traffic Officer B A 
Finch saw the smoke issuing from the
building Fire Chief P J Johnson
just returning from inspecting a
dance was on the job at once and
had the truck at the scene o f the fire
before the other members o f the fire
company arrived 
Apparently the fire started in the
basement and had gained considerable
headway in a blaze that swept the
store smoke and fire damaging all o f
the stock o f the store The front
windows were cracked by the heat but
were8 not broken There was not a
great deal o f damage done to the
building itself but the contents may
be regarded as a loss from standpoint
o f condition The firemen got the
fire under control and there was no
water damage except in the rear of
the store 
The Hagen Son clothing store 
just east o f the IGA was filled with
smoke and for a time it could not be
told in which store the fire had started 
the smoke was so thick 
Mrs Anderson and children Ronald
and Virginia had left Saturday
for Minneapolis where Mr Anderson
has been under treatment in the
Northwestern hospital He is to undergo
an operation just after the
first o f the year but was released
from the hospital to accompany them
to Brainerd Minnesota where they
were going to spend Christmas with
Mrs Anderson s brother Earl Luke
and family They were advised o f the
fire and Mr Anderson returned here
with his family yesterday He will
return to Minneapolis to re enter the
hospital later in the week For the
present he has an office in the Hancock
Hardware store where IGA customers
may see him All the friends
o f the family feel deep sympathy for
the Andersons 
Both the IGA and Hagen stores are
closed and an inventory is being taken
today o f the stock There is insurance
coverage and insurance inspectors
arrived last night The IGA
building belongs to J R McDonald
and the Hagen building to the Oderbolz
estate 
Mrs Ole Rudd was able to leave the
hospital recently and go to the home
o f her daughter Mrs Lilley where
she is spending some time before going
to her home in Oak Ridge Mrs 
Rudd is past 80 years o f age and has
made a remarkable recovery1 It will
be remembered that she was crossing
highway 12 near her home in Oak
Ridge where she lives aloi e carrying
some poles for firewood and the poles
were struck by a passing motorist and
she was knocked to the pavement suffering
a broken leg and a skull fracture 
The accident happened near
Mrs Peter Greens place and she summoned
aid and Mrs Rudd was taken
to the hospital by ambulance She
made a fine recovery and is now able
to get about with the aid o f a cane 
She will probably be just as active
as ever and make a complete recovery 
which will be pleasing to all who
know her She is very appreciative
o f the calls that were made upon her
and o f the cards letters and sunshines
she received during the time
she was in the hospital We are sure
it was a pleasure to her friends to be
able to remember her and show her
their sympathy and how much they
admired her courage and good cheer 
Ulysses White came over from Wisconsin
Rapids Saturday and spent
an hour or so in town going on to
Tomah Ulysses moved from the Indian

and as they finished graded

day W E Abbott and Miss Gertrude
Trudelle were married in this city on
Christmas day 1879 The wedding
occurred at the home of her parents 
the late Captain and Mrs Peter Trudelle 
the residence which during later
years had been the home o f the
late Mr and Mrs Anton Kelner and
is now occupied by their daughter 
Mrs Rose Clarin The old home still
stands in an excellent state o f preservation 
The wedding ceremony at the time
o f their marriage was performed by
Rev Father Wil am H H Ross who
at that time was the nastor o f the
Episcopal church in this city In
planning for the wedding it had been
expected that the ceremony would be
read by the late Rev Joseph Green
Wells o f Sechlerville but owing to
the bad weather he was unable to get
to Black River Falls for the occasion 
Mr Abbott was employed for some
time after the wedding in this city
with the firm o f S P and R C 
Jones which afterward became the
Jones Lumber Mercantile Company 
and they made their home here In
October 1885 he was called to Hixton
where Captain Trudelle had established
a prosperous mercantile business 
Captain Trudelle was succeeded
by his son Theodore K Trudelle 
who passed away a few months
after coming into the business Mr 
Abbott thereupon took charge o f the
business and has continued to own
and operate it ever since Undoubtedly
he has the longest business record
o f any merchant in the county 
Although advanced in years he still
continues to operate the store with
the assistance o f his daughter Miss
Edna 
Throughout the valley he early established
a reputation for enterprise 
honesty and square dealing and in
consequence he has had an excellent
business throughout the more than
half century he has spent at Hixton 
Both Mr and Mrs Abbott have been
active in social and civic affairs in the
valley ever since going there as young
people They still live in the fine
old home where the greater part o f
their married life has been spent 
Their daughter Miss Edna resides
with them and their daughter Mrs 
Lawrence Chappie nearby One
daughter Vesta Mrs William Miller 
passed away a few years ago leaving
two daughters Misses Jean and Mary
Lou the latter at home in Alma Center
and Miss Jean in Milwaukee She
was home for Christmas and the anniversary
o f her grandparents 
Kindly genial and friendly toward
everybody the aged couple have established
a great circle o f friends not
only here in their own county but in
adjoining counties as well among
whom they are very highly esteemed 
This host o f friends including hundreds
who were unable to attend their
anniversary celebration sincerely join
in trusting that both may continue in
good health and happiness for years
to come They are well worthy o f
the friendship confidence and esteem
in which they have always been held 
May this New Year bring to you all that you wish
 |
i
in the way of happiness health and wealth 
May it bring peace in your heart and in the world

STATEM EN T BY AM ERICAN
RED CROSS ON RELIEF
Many inquiries are bein g received
from our chapters the public and the
press as to the relation o f Red Cross
war relief work to the efforts o f many
special committees and organizations
which have recently been formed to
render aid in some particular phase
o f present European hostilities 
From the outset the American Red
Cross has been in close touch with the
war relief situation but mindful o f
our responsibilities at home has not
felt that the needs abroad were such
as yet to make necessary a major
campaign by the Red Cross for a war
relief fund 
However many needs exist and
those who can aid should make their
contributions promptly either to the
Red Cross or if they prefer to those
responsible temporary agencies dealing
with special phases o f war relief
needs As in the past the Red Cross
will conduct its work in such a manner
that other agencies may co ordinate
their activities with ours so
that there need be no duplication in
the relief to be rendered The Red
Cross has from time to time invited
representatives o f other groups to
meet with it to coordinate the various
efforts and many o f these groups are
sending their funds to the Red Cross
designated for relief in the country
in which they are interested 
It must be remembered that the
Red Cross is a permanent institution 
it operates under the authority o f an
international treaty and a congressional
charter and it has continuing
and primary responsibilities for the
conduct o f Red Cross work in the
United States alike nationally and in
the more than ten thousand communities
where its chapters are active
throughout this country 
The Red Cross also has international
responsibilities and immediately
upon the outbreak o f the present hostilities
we initiated operations to meet
most critical emergency needs We
have sent assistance in the form o f
cash medical and hospital supplies
and clothing to the Red Cross societies
o f Great Britain France and Poland
in response to their requests 
and to the societies o f Hungary Rumania 
Latvia Esthonia and Lithuania
for aid to Polish refugees 
In the last week we have been
asked to send emergency medical aid
to the Finnish Red Cross and the requested
supplies have already reached
Finland We have sent a representative
to Finland and we are prepared
to extend further aid as we
gain more accurate knowledge o f the
needs in that country 
In war relief we emphasize first 
medical and hospital aid and in addition
thousands o f volunteers in our
chapters are producing surgical dressings
and warm clothing in large
quantities which we are shipping as
rapidly as tonnage is available 
In our recent Roll Call the public
has again generously responded for
the support o f the regular work of the
Red Cross From the outset o f the
European war we have sought and
received contributions for relief to
war sufferers o f all countries and
donors may designate the peoples for
which they wish to have their contributions
utilized Such designated contributions
will be expended wholly
ard exclusively for assistance in accordance
with the wishes o f the donors 
With the recently developed conflict
in Finland we have advised all
our chapters that we welcome contributions
designated for relief in that
country 
As the conflict continues the needs
will inevitably very greatly increase
and the best efforts o f all will be
required if our country is to play
its part in mitigating the sufferings
o f this catastrophe

A co operative housing project is
being organized in St Paul by members
o f the postoffice city and county
Employees Credit Unions The plans
call for the construction o f 30 to 50
homes at one time thereby making
it possible to obtain reductions in
building materials ranging from 20 to
50 per cent it is expected Much of
the construction will be done in a
central warehouse and assembled at
the site The basements are all to be
dug by one steam shovel Using these
methods the association believes that
it can construct good homes o f five
rooms at a cost o f approximately
$3 500 or a saving o f $1 000 The
homes will each be o f different design
but will harmonize with one another 
The Federal Housing Authority
has guaranteed a loan to cover the
cost o f building or 90 per cent o f the
total

gasoline the British Co operatives are
aiding the nation s drive to conserve
petroleum products by using horsedrawn

Thursday o f this week is the date
set for the opening o f the Co op oil
refinery at Phillipsburg Kansas Built
at a cost o f $700 000 and served by
a 70 mile gathering pipe line the refinery
will process 3 000 barrels o f

would take 50 such refineries to supply
the co operative news o f the nation 
This is the first Co op refinery
to be built in the United States
and is o f especial interest to the Cooperative

they own part interest and through
their board o f directors have a voice
in its operation 
With the closing o f this year 1939
marks the end o f the first decade of
a peaceful revolution in our own
country in changing from capitalism
to co operative Capitalism reached
its climax on October 23 1929 ten
years ago The date that many o f
ouii rr rpeople well remember The headlines
read Prices o f Stocks Crash
In Heavy Liquidation Later they
read Stocks Collapse Amid Torrent
o f Liquidation Since then as capitalism
has failed to meet the economic
needs o f the people co operatives have
risen up to take their place We can
take some comfort in these troubled
times in the fact that we are ten
years on the way through the transition
stage from the collapse o f capitalism
to the coming o f co operation 
During this period and especially the
last year or two the co operative
movement has been endorsed by practically
all churches and both labor organizations
and has won the support

FIND PETRIFIED
PIECE OF W OOD
Black River Falls Wis (Special)
 The sixth piece o f petrified wood to
be found in this vicinity was brought
in by Otis Meyers engineer for the
Farm Security administration It was
found at Hatfield below the dam
where workmen had been hauling
rock for making spillways 
The wood appears to be a piece o f
oak chopped on the end and is 15
inches long two inches thick and
eight inches wide The piece weighs
between 25 and 30 pounds The first
piece was found three years ago 
David Blencoe John C Johnson
and P W Dickey also have pieces
o f petrified wood found on Black river 
It has always been considered
that lime was required to take the
place o f the decaying wood and it
has also been believed that the water
o f Black river was extremely soft 
hence finding petrified wood along
the river is considered unusual The
apparent saw and axe marks on it
would indicate that the process had
taken place quite rapidly

 The Pilgrim fathers endured the
hardships o f traveling on a rough
ocean and o f establishing a new civilization
on a rockbound New England
coast that they and their descendents
might enjoy the liberties o f
a free people said the Rev Harold
Allison o f Black River Falls speaking
to the Kiwanis club Monday evening 
 But these privileges and opportunities
also bring responsibilites 
and the fathers and mothers in America
today must think o f American
youth The speaker urged his listeners
to take a firm stand against Communism
or any other ism which
tries to undermine the liberties guaranteed
in the American constitution 
 Each o f us as a father or a
mother must think o f the future of
this nation and especially o f the
young people who will guide the ship
o f state in the tomorrow 
 The church the school and the
home are the foundations o f this republic 
 said Mr Allison and we
must see that they mean something in
the lives o f our boys and girls 
 At this Christmas season let us
be thankful that this nation has been
so fortunate and may we realize that
these blessings have not come to us
by chance or by luck but from the
hands o f a Supreme Being whose
birthday we celebrate at this season

Flames leveled the home o f Mr 
and Mrs Frank Harris at Cataract
this Thursday morning in a disastrous
fire No apparent reason could
be given for the blaze but it is believed
that it may have started from
an overheated furnace The residence
destroyed by the fire is the property
o f Rex Washburn 
No one was at home when the fire
broke out First to arrive on the
scene was Mrs Harris and John Boisen 
Other neighbors in the village
soon saw the smoke rolling from the
house and quickly came to the scene
to see whether they could be o f assistance 
Black billowing smoke and terrific
heat prevented volunteers from
getting more than a few pieces o f
furniture from the house All that
could be rescued was furniture that
had been stored in a glassed in porch
in the front part o f the house 
A bucket brigade was formed but
efforts were largely confined to saving
the remaining buildings on the
premises The building burned quickly
and soon was a smoldering mass o f
ruins

crop this year is about 70 per cent
larger than in 1938 and more than 80
per cent above the 10 year average 
Wisconsin is the second largest producer
o f cranberries in the nation 
The nation s crop this year was about
40 per cent larger than a year ago
and nearly 12 per cent above average 
making the total supply well
above average 
A record turkey crop was raised in
the nation this year In Wisconsin
a more than average number o f turkeys
were raised Estimates show that
the total supply for the nation this
year is about 22 per cent larger than
a year ago O f the turkeys raised in

to market about half the crop in
December or later More than a third
o f the turkeys are intended for the

TRENDS OF EDUCATION DURING
PAST SEVEN DECADES
Prominent In the teaching profession
for over 55 years C J Brewer 
until his retirement last year head
o f the training department o f the
Eau Claire State Teachers college 
has answered some questions in regani
to the progress o f education in
Wisconsin since that time When
asked on the basis o f his seven decades
in the schools o f northwestern
Wisconsin as a student teacher principal
and superintendent what changes
had impressed him most he replied
 
 The growth o f libraries general
equipment and the broadening o f the
course o f study to include what might
be called the purely cultural side of
education such as music art etc all
o f which I think are decidedly for
the best are favorable changes that
have impressed me For a good many
years past there has been an observable
tendency to convert the elementary
schools very largely into institutions
the primary purpose o f which
seems to be to entertain and amuse
pupils and at the same time to so
simplify subject matter as to avoid
anything that could be denominated
to hard work on the part o f the pupils 
That has gone to a ridiculous
extent in some places So called au
thorities in educational matters advocate
leaving it to pupils entirely
as to what they should study when
they should recite and how they
should behave I f I had the space I
could enlarge upon this Looking
back over my life up to date most of
the time I have had to do something
I didn t want to do at least at that
particular time I had to do it It
seems to me that there is the common
fot o f mankind I think the tendency
now more or less current is a mighty
poor method o f procedure designed to
prepare our boys and girls for their
places in life 
Brewer was asked if he saw any
danger o f losing something o f vital
worth in social values in forming
communities by the growth o f the
consolidation aid transportation movement
in Wisconsin His answer follows 
 The question o f consolidation o f
the district schools into larger centralized
graded schols as a general
proposition is a controverted question 
I think the recent act o f the
legislature designed to result in the
closing o f district schools the enrollment
o f which is very small say ten
or less is good But when it comes
to a question o f consolidation o f reasonably
large district schools the question
is a controverted one The practicability
o f the consolidation in relative
large schools depends a great
deal on the topography o f the country 
In some places it would be very
difficult to bring about such consolidation 
But where the conditions
geographically are the most favorable
there are still two sides to the controversy 
The general tendency now
is to centralize everything governmental 
The community that sustains a
single school where geographical conditions
and population are favorable
will lose distinctly in a social way by
consolidaton whch would remove the
schools and their financial support
from the immediate neighborhoods
sustaining them There are undoubtedly
some gains in consolidating
schools generally where geographical
conditions make it practicable but at
the same time there is a loss It is
simply a question o f deciding which
element predominates You ask me
to answer this question based upon
my observation covering a period o f
many years Whether a school is
 good or not depends more upon
what kind o f teachers are employed
and not upon the number o f them in
any school system Without any exaggeration
I have visited and noted
as carefully as I could teaching and
management o f many hundreds o f
schools That has been my principal
business for the last 30 years or
so Some o f the best schools that I
have ever observed are one room rural
schools And some o f the poorest
teaching that I have ever seen
has been observed in what could be
called great educational institutions 
What constitutes a good school is
too large a question to discuss in this
connection 
Qualifications for a good teacher
were also listed by the veteran educator
as follows 
 In order o f importance I would
place as some o f the qualities needed
to make a good teacher the indefinable
thing that we call personality 
the leading characteristic o f
which is Common Sense A good supply
o f common sense should o f course 
be accompanied by a sufficient degree
o f scholarship to interpret the common
events o f life as they appear 
Sympathy The qualification which is
now apparently considered o f first
importance by employing officers generally
is a college degree To my
mind that in itself is o f the very least
importance I have undertaken to
disseminate that doctrine for years in
my teaching I am happy to note in
a recent issue o f the daily press that
the Carnegie Foundation in its latest
report speaks o f college degrees in
themselves as particularly valueless in
modern life To quote one sentence 
 All over the country teaching and
other positions are being filled by degrees 
not by men and women Eau

Death never takes a holiday
Throughout the year holiday deaths
take the lgad in number o f fatalities
and with the Christmas holiday the
month o f December is the most dangerous
month o f the year for traffic
fatalities 
Dfccember is one and one half
times as dangerous as the safest
month June In a statement from
the National Safety council it had
been said pedestrians made up almost
half o f the month s motor vehicle
fatalities with 1 600 
Night accidents also increase Peak
traffic occurs at dusk or after nightfall
instead o f during the daytime as
at other periods o f the year Ice and
snow causing skidding also increase
the Grim Reapers total 
The holiday shopping rush parties
and family reunions increase traffic
and drivers under the influence o f
liquor all add their bit to December s
bad record 
Therefore the National Safety council 
in an effort to bring about a better
record for the month gives out
the following tips 
Check up on your car especially
electrical and exhaust systems windshield
wiper brakes adequate vision
and ventilation through windshield
and windows 
Drive slowly on slippery pavements 
Use chains when driving on
ice and snow to avoid spinning o f
wheels 
If a skid starts turn the front
wheels in the direction which the car
wheels are skidding Shorten trips
and stop often to relax when conditions
are bad 
Summing it all up Be Careful!

FOOD M AY BE SAFELY
LEFT IN OPENED CAN
Just because a food idea is old
doesn t mean that it s true 
 For example the old rumor that
food could not be left in an open tin
can is false says Mrs May Reynolds 
of the home economics department at
the University o f Wisconsin It is
just as safe to keep canned food in
the can it comes in if the can is
cool and covered as it is to empty
the food into another container Both
the cans and food are sterilized during
the canning process 
 No dangerous substance dissolves
into the juice from the can as some
people think You can feel perfectly
safe about opening a can using part
o f the food in it and then putting
the rest away in the can in the refrigerator
for another meal There s
not a bit o f truth in the old rumor
that when the can is open the metal
somehow acts on the food and makes
it harmful 
On the other hand food can t be
kept in an open tin can indefinitely 
If it stands too long in the can it will
spoil there just as it will anywhere
else However that s not the fault o f
the can and it has nothing to do with
the metal 
This is just one o f those food superstitions
that started nobody knows
where or why and hasn t stopped yet 
Whether in the original can or in
another container the main precautions
for keeping food are keep it
cool and keep it covered

BRIGHTER SIDE OF
h
Nineteen forty turns its brighter side
toward the United States and its darker
 ide toward most of the rest of the world 
Obviously no one can foresee the course
of future events While our hopes are for
an early and just peace abroad we must
concentrate upon the duties and problems
confronting us at home realizing
that conditions here will be profoundly
affected by the situation there 
Also as we extend New Year wishes
to each other let us not selfishly put the
emphasis upon happiness but rather
upon worthiness that we may each
prove worthy of our opportunities and
our responsibilities

MERLIN H ULL S LE TTE R
Estimating national income for the
year becomes almost an industry at
this season as government departments
and other fact gathering agencies
sum up the estimates gathered
from far and wide Just how accurate
these estimates are is more or
less guess work Next year the figures
obtained by the 143 000 Census
bureau employees will become available 
and it may become possible to
compare estimates with official census
returns 
The figure sharps now guess that
the total national income for 1939
will approximate $68 billions some
five billions more than 1938 and three
billions less than 1937 It will be
fourteen billions less than 1929 when
notwithstanding the shrinkage o f several
billions in bond and share values 
the income was put at $82 billions 
Such big figures are more interesting
for comparison than for any other
purpose as billions are too big for
most o f us to recognize should we
chance to meet up with them 
It is supposed by some that if our
national income which is presumed
to include the income o f every person
from that o f millionaires to the earnings
o f newsboys on the streets were
to get back to the 1929 basis most o f
the financial difficulties incident to
the depression would be on their way
out whether or not that would be
the case remains to be determined 
but most people would be glad to
find out The federal revenues would
increase wonderfully from income and
corporation tax moneys and state governments
would also have less difficulty
in balancing budgets Some
government costs such as for relief
might also be greatly reduced Deficits
and debt building might have a
holiday 
The Commerce department which
rounds up and rounds out most o f
the estimates states that a big portion
o f the increase o f totals was from the
share labor received Owners o f
stocks and bonds also fared well receiving
about the same proportion of
the national income as in 1929 Part
o f the increase o f distribution to labor
was due to government activities 
The estimated farm cash income is
put at $7 625 000 000 which is more
than one billion less than the figures
o f the Agricultural department for
1938 The cash payments made under
the A AA were $625 millions or
about 9 per cent o f the total The
government payments amounted to
an average in all the states o f $90
per farm States growing com cotton 
wheat rice and tobacco received
much more than the average and
other states considerably less 
The farmers portion o f the estimated
national income will be about 11
per cent marking still another decline
in the portion which goes to 25 per
cent o f our total population Undoubtedly
that declining percentage in the
face o f government aid and subsidies
points more strongly than ever before
to the necessity o f curing farm depression
as a foundation for future
prosperity Some o f the eastern
newspapers are particularly hostile to
farm subsidies and at the same time
seem to believe that all farm troubles
may be remedied by increased employment
and larger industrial payrolls 
The production o f industrial
commodities is now back to 1929 levels 
Railways and other transportation
systems are back on a profitable
basis The prices o f pork eggs and
butterfat along with numerous other
farm products are much below 1937 
and still much lower than in 1929 
The eastern people should revise their
theory that factory pay rolls gauge
farm prosperity and get busy toward
putting purchasing power back on
the farms When the farmers can
start to buy the depression will move
on and off 
Although other war nations o f
Europe are forbidden by law to attempt
obtaining more credit for war
purchases little Finland is having no
such difficulty Finland has been paying
its annual installments on what it
owes our national treasury When it
asked for a loan o f $10 000 000
through the Export Import bank it
was promptly granted That country
may submit a request for another loan
o f fifty millions when congress meets
next week to carry on its brave fight
against the brutal Russian invasion 
Sentiment in this country is overwhelmingly
favorable to Finland in its
life or death struggle and even had
it not been paying its World War
debt possibly the request might be
granted but the fact that it protects
its credit makes the matter much
easier for the administration 
A fter years o f futile endeavor the
southern states have been able to obtain
a decision from the Interstate
Commerce Commission abolishing the
railway freight rate discrimination
against their products and making the
rates comparable with those o f northeastern
states for the same kind of
service In the main the southern
rates have been about 30 per cent
higher thus affording a great advantage
to the eastern industries which
have strenuously opposed the change 
This decision will cause other less
favored sections to bring similar actions
to the same purpose The northwestern
states are said to be discriminated
against by the same system o f
rate adjustments made many years
ago some to the extent o f 40 per
cent Eastern cities and states which
have had such great advantages as to
rates have lured many industries
from the middle west because o f the
lower rates and our present industries
as well as our agriculture continue
to suffer from that form o f
competition The question has been
under debate for half a century and
ever since the I C C was established 
A t last the door has been opened to
its solution 
The president s cabinet is rather divided
on the question o f new taxation
measures Secretary Wallace
proposes a new and cumbersome form
o f consumers taxes on farm products
to raise a parity fund for commodities
subsidized under AAA Secretary

COUNTY A G E N T NOTES
Dairy Products Advertising
Some time during the first part of
January invitations will be mailed to
all dairy plants in the county inviting
a delegate to attend a county wide
dairy meeting at the court house 
These dairy plants include all creameries 
cheese factories milk stations 
ice cream plants etc Included in this
list o f delegates will be those who
were recently appointed as members
o f the county dairy products promotion
committee The delegates and
committeemen will meet with a representative
o f the Wisconsin Dairy Industries
Association to formulate
plans for raising Jackson county s
quota o f the state s advertising fund 
Every county in the state is organizing
for the campaign officials announce 
The goal is 100 per cent
co operation o f the state s 3100 dairy
plants signing up a small deduction
by the first handler o f the state s
annual production o f 400 million
pounds o f butterfat which would
amount to $200 000 Agreements will
not become effective until at least
$100 000 has been pledged Funds
will be collected and spent by the
Wisconsin Dairy Association fo r promoting
greater consumption o f all
dairy products 
A national dairy products advertising
program is in the making Already
Minnesota Iowa and Washington
have their quotas To put Wisconsin
over the top is the campaign s
objective 
The state department o f agriculture 
the Wisconsin College o f Agriculture 
and every county in the state
are co operating with the Wisconsin
Dairy Industries Association a nonprofit
organization composed o f representatives
from every branch o f the
dairy industry 
Soil Program
Allotments productivity indexes
and yields for the 1940 agricultural
conservation program have been established
for Wisconsin and Jackson
county 
Established as the county s share o f
national crop goals the allotments are
being apportioned to individual farms
by county and community committeemen 
Individual allotments are expected
to be ready for farmers by
January 15th Farmers will have 15
days in which to appeal after receiving
their allotments 
The total soil depleting allotment
for Jackson county has been set at
90 817 acres This total soil depleting
acreage allotment covers all soil
depleting crops raised Among special
crop allotments which apply to
the county an allotment o f 1648
acres has been set for wheat and
420 acres for potatoes Tobacco and
commercial vegetable allotments will
be announced later 
The state allotment for total soil
depleting crops is 6 409 26  acres a
slight reduction from the 6 480 759
acres for 1939 The wheat allotment
has been raised from 90 203 acres for
1939 to 989 12 acres for 1940 The
potato acreages has been set at 108 
961 compared with 111 238 in 1939 
and 24 972 acres have been allotted
to tobacco which is about the same
as for 1939 
The difference between the total allotment
and the total state cropland
o f about 12 million craes or around
5 million acres indicates the
amount o f land which is kept in soil
conserving or non depleting crops 
State and county productivity indexes
yields also have been announced 
The county productivity index for
all farms in the county will average
109 8 This compares with an average
o f 100 for the entire United
States 
Rates o f payment under the 1940
program are $1 10 per acre on general
crops 10 cents per bushel on
com 9 cents per bushel on wheat 
3 cents per bushel on potatoes 1 cent
per pound on tobacco and $1 50 per
acre on commercial vegetables 
Farmers who participate in the
A A A program and exceed their acreage
allotments will be subject to payment
deductions o f $8 per acre on
general crops 50 cents per bushel
on wheat 8 cents per pound on tobacco 
30 cents per bushel on potatoes
and $20 per acre on commercial
vegetables 
Livestock Tuberculosis Test
Wisconsin dairymen may now note
with both pride and satisfaction that
a plan in which they pioneered for
safeguarding health o f their dairy
herds has finally been adopted by
every other state in the Union 
It was cheering news to H L Russell 
former dean o f the State College
o f Agriculture when he heard that
every herd o f cattle in the United
States had now been tested at least
once for tuberculosis Having been
one o f the two men who brought the
tuberculin test to the United States 
he rejoiced in the success o f the 46
years o f continued effort to test the
herds in this county It was in 1894
that Russell applied the tuberculin
test to the herd o f the University o f
Wisconsin the first to be tested west
o f the Allegheny mountains 
Wisconsin was also a pioneer in
applying the test and ridding entire
areas o f the disease The first county
in the United States to test all
cattle within its boundaries and to
be declared a modified accredited area
was in Barron county 
Testing the last herd signifies that
all serious opposition which has hampered
official tuberculin testing in various
parts o f the country has been
overcome Of course much retesting
still remains to be done but the most
difficult obstacles have now been surmounted 
The last herd to receive its initial
test was out in Stanislaus county 
California Although every herd in
California and in the United States
has now been tested six counties in
California have not yet qualified for
official designation as modofied accredited
areas However the work is
proceeding rapidly Since July 1st 
1939 a total o f 472 599 cattle in
California have been tested o f which
8 101 were classed as tuberculosis 
During the progress o f the nationwide
campaign a total o f approximately
3 750 000 cattle have been
sent to slaughter 
The tuberculosis eradication campaign
in the United States has been
watched with interest by veterinary
and livestock officials in the principal
countries o f the world since it
is the largest undertaking o f its kind
in the annals o f agriculture and veterinary
science The continued activity
will consist o f periodic retesting
in order to detect promptly any cases
o f the disease thus providing a safeguard
against any material reinfection 
JESUS OF N A ZA RETH
Under date o f April 12 1933 in
his talk on The Human Side o f the
News Edwin C Hill related the following
story describing the personal
appearance o f Jesus written in the
lifetime o f the Saviour possibly the
only description ever written by one
who saw him It has only lately appeared
in print Mr Hill s article is
as follows 
 What manner o f man is this that
even the wind and the sea obey him  
 Mark IV 11
There is in existence a detailed description
o f Jesus o f Nazareth one
that is not perhaps familiar to many
people It is contained in a letter
written by Publius Lentulu  the Roman
governor o f Judea to the Roman
senate in the days when Tiberius
Caesar ruled the Roman world It
was the invariable custom o f Roman
governors to supply to the Roman senate
every item o f news and information
which might be o f use or interest
to the state 
And when Christ was preaching in
Judea and working his good work 
there was keen interest in Rome and
much curiosity about his sayings and
doings and naturally in what he looked
like So Publius Lentulus took his
stylus in hand and wrote down all
that he had heard or seen about one
whom the Romans had no cause to
love Coming from a Roman and a
Roman official it is I think a remarkable
letter Here is what Publius
Lentulus wrote the best description
o f Jesus that I have ever read 
 Conscript Fathers There has appeared
in these days a man o f great
virtue named Christ who is yet living
among us and o f the Gentiles is
accepted as a prophet o f truth but
his own disciples call him the Son o f
God He raiseth the dead and cureth
all manner o f diseases A man o f
stature somewhat tall and mostly
comely with a very reverend countenance 
such as the beholders may
both love and fear His hair is the
color o f a chestnut full ripe plain
to the ears whence downward it is
more Oriental and curling waving
about his shoulders In the midst of
his head is a seam o f partition o f his
hair after the manner o f the Nazarenes 
his forehead plain and very
delicate his face without spot or
wrinkle beautiful with a lovely red 
his nose and mouth are formed as
nothing can be represented his
beard thickish in color like his hair 
not very long forked his look innocent
and moderate his eye clear
and quick In reproving he is terrible 
in admonishing courteous and
fair spoken It cannot be remembered
that any have seen him laugh but
many have seen him weep In proportion
o f body most excellent his
hands and arms most delicate to behold 
in speaking very temperate 
modest and wise A man for his
singular beauty surpassing the children
o f men

have seen a great light they
that dwell in the land o f the shadow
o f death upon them hath the light
shined For unto us a child is bom 
unto us a son is given And the child
grew and waxed strong in spirit filled
with wisdom and the grace o f
God was upon him (Isaiah 9 2 16 
Luke 2 40)

was appointed to speak God s word
and to appear to mortals in such a
form o f humanity as they could understand

REDSKINS TO BATTLE TEXACOS
The big oil and gas boys o f Van
Gorden Christianson et al did their
second swooning act o f the season at
the Hixton crackerbox a week ago
and so dropped the second decision o f
the season to enemy cagers The tussle
v/ent into an overtime period tied
at 16 then in the overtime even
smelling salts couldn t rouse the Texacos
from their lethargy and the
Hixton Fire Chiefs by virtue o f a
brace o f court successes gained a 20
to 16 edge at the blurt o f the last
whistle 
The Merrillan outfit started off as
if they were going to play a game o f
basketball but after missing 20 or so
set up shots in the first frame decided
it wasn t their night and that they
couldn t play ball under the prevailing
conditions anyway Osborn once
again played his usual steady brand
o f ball but the rest o f the boys were
definitely off It must be said for
the Hixton team that they had plenty
o f scrap and promise to have a high
class squad after a few wrinkles are
ironed out Maybe the licking the
Texacos took at Hixton is just the
remedy needed to cure the boys of
the lethargic ailment which has
threatened to cast a smirch on their
record and reputations 
On Saturday Jan 26 a band o f
pesky Sioux Indians from Nebraska 
rated as the fastest bucket squad on
American hardwoods will visit the
Texacos and try to add to their great
record which for the season to date
has reached an amazing string o f 30
straight victories These descendants
o f Sitting Bull are not only as fast
as the proverbial streak o f light but
rate among the best in the business at
ball handling Notices from nearly
all the spots they have appeared rate
them as a cage wonder and demands
for return engagements have been
piling up The local boys were lucky
enough to catch their red skinned
brethren with an open date Originally 
the date was set for Jan 3 
but has been moved up to Saturday 
Jan 6 to fit into the visitors schedule 
The game will start at 9 p m 
on the nose so folks will have to buy
their Sunday groceries before seeing
the second chapter o f the ouster massacre

The season s greetings o f a very
Happy Christmas and a Very Happy
Prosperous New Year to all our readers
o f the B J and to its correspondents 
It s really hard to understand why
the old world being the cradle of
Christianity should forever be the
battle ground o f nations whose ideals
and principles are directly opposite
to the doctrines so strongly exemplified
by the Saviour whose birthday
we have just celebrated It is so
pleasingly strange that our nation so
far removed from the stamping
ground o f the great teacher should be
the bulwark o f the Christian doctrine 
Be it as it may we should all be
thankful not only for ourselves and
our children but for those nations who
look to our shores from which good
will towards all men should emanate 
Therefore we should all the
more enjoy the Christmas and New
Year holidays 
Wars may come and wars may go 
but human nature remains the same 
Wars can not be fought to end all
wars and wars do not just happen 
The human element enters into the
picture somewheres The human element
o f vicious and ambitious greed
or ambitious viciousness or greeditious
ambition any way you want to
take it Wars could be brought to
an end if only these adverse human
traits could be eliminated To eliminate
them there should be no moral
embargo Yes! There should be no
embargo on morals instead these warring
nations should be bombed with
Christian and American morals 
In these modem warfares everything
is streamlined Bombing and
pursuit planes battleships and submarines
and even bombs are scream lined 
Two great factors seem always to
be clashing in this great country of
ours To the men representing the
long arm o f the law every individual
is a potential criminal while to the
pulpit every individual is a potential
saint And if we can go by the
Christmas spirit o f giving so much
manifested by the people the pulpit
seems to have the edge 
Speaking o f wars and Christmas 
wars have killed only their thousands
while peace has killed its hundred
thousands Speak as much as we
want o f war and its horrors but the
above is the truth 
It takes all kinds o f people to make
a world and one o f the meanest kind
is one who scuttles his pocketbook so
the wife can t capture it during the
Christmas shopping season

ing reported which is very fine for
the amount o f traffic 
I hope we can get by this coming
week end and New Year s day without
any accidents Last week end in
the United States there were 415
deaths caused by motor vehicle accidents 
Some were put in hospitals
and some o f them may die More people
were killed this last week end by
motor vehicle than in the world war
from the United States in the same
length o f time Let s all be careful
this week end so we won t have any
accidents 
I wish all o f you a very happy New
Year s day and happiness all through
