they went to Neillsville where the
Senator addressed a meeting under
the auspices of the Neillsville Kiwanis
club He had made numerous addresses
in the state since his return
from Washington 
The Senator talked for more than
an hour during which he described
some of the events of his trip to Norway 
last summer to attend the Interparliamentary
convention He visited
the early home of his parents discussed
the European situation with kings 
princes and statesmen and learned
much from the convention which he
attended He was not pleased with
the future prospects of Europe with
the possibility of wide spread destruction
in the warring countries He also
recounted his experiences in the United
States Senate particularly those
of the special session when the Neutrality
bill was under consideration 
He warned of the dangers of the
involvement of our country in another
World war and advised that no
matter what might be the developments
and the pressure later on the
people should remain calm in their
consideration of any crisis Only by
a united front and a determination
to keep out of the war at any cost
could there be the assurance that we
should not become involved 
After his address the Senator
shook hands with the members of the
board and others before departing

Mr and Mrs Paul Duxbury of
Hixton were victims in an automobile
accident near Arcadia on Thursday
of last week They were traveling
safely rounding a curve on their
own side of the road when a car approached
recklessly from the opposite
direction Instead of that car making
the turn it went across the road and
struck Mr Duxbury s car throwing it
over and into the ditch Fortunately
Mr Duxbury was not badly hurt and
he assisted Mrs Duxbury from the
car She suffered much pain The
car was righted though it was badly
damaged and they were able to continue
to their home at Hixton 
Dr Petzke was called and upon
first examination it was thought
that she was suffering mainly from a
sprained back along with many
bruises and the shock of the accident 
Later when the pain continued to be
very acute she was taken to the Community
hospital at Whitehall for an
x ray examination There it was found
that she had sustained a fracture of
one of the vertebrae She has since
been under treatment at the hospital 
She has been slowly improving Her
injuries are of such a nature that
probably she will be some time in recovering 
but it is hoped that eventually
her recovery will be complete

The city of Black River Falls was
given the service of a public health
nurse for one w'eek and the fluoroscope
clinic for one day free to all 
This was done through the sale of the
Wisconsin Anti Tuberculosis Christmas
seals The sale was sponsored
through the Black River Falls Woman s
club a club for public welfare
and service to the community The
sale was efficiently supervised by Mrs 
Edward Heineck and her able committee 
Miss Ada Garvey R N from the
Wisconsin Anti Tuberculosis Association 
Milwaukee will well be remembered
by her splendid talk with the
Osotype charts to the Woman s Club 
Also for her case finding work and
her services given to the schools in
B R Falls 
There were 85 examinations given
at the Fluroscope clinic with 14 persons
placed in the Tuberculosis classification
group along with 12 other
persons found to have other findings
such as Bronchial asthma bronchitis 
and heart conditions 
Chest x rays were suggested for six
persons and the possibilities of sanatorium
care for two after further
study 
Tuberculosis is classed as a family
disease because it is a communicable
disease That is passed on from one
member of the family to the other 
It is not inherited as many people
still think 
Persons eligible for the clinic are
those that have had contact with an
active case of tuberculosis and the
positive reactors of the tuberculin
skin test 
School children should be tuberculin
skin tested each year that is if
they have negative test A positive
reactor should have an x ray each
year or as suggested by family physician 
A tuberculin skin testing program
is held at the schools under the
direction of Mr B Johnson sponsored
by the Woman s Club The hardest
hit age group is between 15 and
45 years That is when a person is
of the greatest economic value both
to the family and community 
By the sale of the Christmas seals
education and organized community
forces have been multiplied in every
state of the union for the control of
tuberculosis It costs much more to
allow a person to die of tuberculosis
than to keep him well and alive taking
into consideration the loss to the
family and community plus the cost
of medical care and the transmission
of the disease to other members of
the family 
Early discovery of tuberculosis can
be accomplished by the tuberculin
skin test and x ray Thereby let us
all help with the prevention and care
of tuberculosis by buying Christmas
Seals this year As no home is safe
from tuberculosis until all homes are
safe

We claim to have tops in discretion
among the dogs of the city and if
any one can beat the record they are
to step up and try 
Those who are familiar with the
Noble home and its flora and fauna
know the east porch that is almost
hugged by the old cedarhedge that encircles
the front half of the house and
has for these many years past Last
Saturday night when Mrs Noble arrived
home shortly before six o clock
the porch light was on and seated on
that east porch were Happy and Kelly 
the two white English bull dogs
that infest the place There they sat
in a bright light serenely watching the
progress past the steps of an equally
serene skunk with its tail curled high
and in no hurry whatever as it turned
and rustled through the dry leaves
under the hedge 
The English Bull is noted for its
qualities of companionship and courage
and stability and dignity and as
a companion for children and what
not but we did not know it possessed
quite so much discretion Happy and
Kelly have the run of the house To
tangle with a skunk would have deprived
them of that doubtful pleasure 
A strange cat strolling by their
doorway would be given the run of
its life but there was gangway and
plenty for friend skunk

The plans and aims of the Electric
Co operatives in Wisconsin 
The College of Agriculture was
host to a group of 24 Wisconsin Electric
Co operatives and three Electric
Co operatives from the upper peninsula
of Michigan At least 250 directors 
in addition to 27 project superintendents
and many county agents
and Home demonstration agents were
present 
Those who went from here to attend
were Roy Kunzelman president 
George Johnson Frank C 
Bright Archie Burnett Delbert Nortman 
Theodore Strande M J Smith 
project superintendent and Don
Stromberg superintendent 
Walter O Zervas and Miss Harriet
Brigham were in charge 
The day was spent in the discussion
of how to increase memberships
and use of electricity by each member 
Professor F W Duffee widely
known professor of the College of
Agriculture gave a very interesting
discussion of the mdst logical means
of encouraging the use of electricity 
stressing particularly that those uses
should be encouraged that would definitely
benefit the farmer economically 
without burdening him with too
high an initial cost Foremost in
these uses were poultry lighting water
system irrigation of truck garden
crops such as strawberries and feed
grinding 
Paul Cockrill REA Operating Division 
gave a very clear illustration
of the relationship between membership
density to investment From his
discussion it was quite apparent that
the more members that are sold the
less investment per member and the
easier it is for each cooperative to
meet its amortization payments 
Miss Harriet C Brigham gave a
very informational talk on the economical
use of electricity in the home 
George Dillon REA Regional Supervisor 
gave a very interesting explanation
of why and how an intensive
campaign should be launched He
also gave some interesting statistics
on the national figures of the REA
program REA has lent $265 000 
000 00 to Electric Cooperatives in 44

states of the union Wisconsin has
received $12 940 000 00 to construct
9 500 miles of line two central generating
plants the Wisconsin Power
Cooperative at Chippewa Falls serving
12 cooperatives in the west central
area of the state of which the
Jackson Electric Co operative is a
member and the Tri State Power Cooperative
at Genoa serving electric
co operatives in Minnesota Iowa and
Wisconsin 
The plans and aims of electric cooperatives
in Wisconsin are explained
as follows by Mr Smith project superintendent 
who invites all who are
interested to call and get acquainted 
The REA program has made electricity
available in Wisconsin to some
40 000 farmers of which about 25 
000 are receiving service Service is
thereby available to another 15 000
along these same lines 
Besides the REA program has stim
ulated rural lines by private utilities
so that at this time electricity is available
or being used by about 46 per
cent of the farms in the state This
is an increase of at least 50 per cent
in the farms receiving service now
over those in 1935 In fact more rural
electrification has taken place in
Wisconsin in the last four year than
has taken place in all the years previous
to 1935 
Not only has the program stimulated
rural electrification but it has
brought about the lowering of line
construction costs to about half of
what it formerly was or from $1500 
00 to $2000 00 to $750 00 to $1000 
00 per mile It has done away the
excessive contribution to line construction
cost formerly asked for by
the private utilities It has also
brought about the end of the high
demand charges that had formerly
been asked until today rural consumers
and members of cooperatives
are getting their electricity for about
half what they would have paid had
not the REA program been initiated 
In fact many farmers are getting
their electricity cheaper than in some
of the villages and cities in the state
of Wisconsin All of this has been
accomplshed without asking a single
farmer to pledge one bit of his personal
or private property in any way 
The government thru REA lends
100 per cent on the lines only 
Any farmer in becoming a member
does not jeopardize his farm or
property in any way He merely and
only agrees to use the service for one
year from the time service is made
available and to pay his minimum
bill of $3 50 for 40 kilowatts of electricity 
or $2 00 for 23 kilowatts if
he has only a home At any time
after the expiration of one year he
may notify the co operative that he
no longer wants the service and he
can be disconnected without any obligation
except that his bill for energy
must be paid in full 
The local Jackson Electric Co operative
depends on the communities that
it serves for its successful operation 
In view of the fact that it is adding
greatly to the economic and social
welfare of Jackson county and other
communities it serves it solicits the
support of everyone believing that in
helping the farmer it is directly
helping every one in Jackson county 
Therefore the Jackson Electric Cooperative
invites all of you to participate
with us in speeding the use of
electricity on the farm and in the
home of the farmers of Jackson county 
We ask each and every one of you
to feel free to call at our office and
get any information you may desire
on how to get electricity on your
farm and how to use it after you
have it 
It is possible to finance the wiring
of farms and home and the purchase
of appliances Make it a point
to drop in for a visit I f you understand
our aims and plans and we
know your needs and plans we feel
sure every one will be mutually benefitted

We are this week publishing an interior
and exterior view of the new
building on Taylor street just west
of the Larkin hardware store the location
of which ts well known through
its many years of service to the city 
The pictures were made by C C 
Berkins 
Millis Son started the building
in July It is 30x132 feet in dimension 
one story high The two hexagon
windows of the front are set in
a bright blue tile and the rest of the i
front is red brick Reflected in the
windows in the picture above will be
seen the two buildings across the
street which have taken this way of
making themselves immortal One is
the blacksmith shop occupied by Fred
Haralson and Maynard Cole the other
the end of the former Dell block 
Both are new Roiseland buildings 
The Millis building has been named
 Millis Recreation and is living up
to its name very nobly Equipped
with Brunswick alleys they are the
last word in bowling perfection and
have been enjoyed by a great many
bowlers ever since the formal opening
of the building October 14th 
Thirty two teams play every week 
consisting of three leagues the city 
county and ladies Monday Tuesday 
Wednesday and Thursday nights
are given over to the league games
which are attracting a lot of attention 
There are 12 teams in the city
and ladies leagues and eight in the
county At present the standings of
the leagues are as follows 
Hagens are leading in the City
League Olson s Cafe in the County
League The Black River Cafe is
leading in the Ladies League 
The front of the Millis building is
occupied by a beautiful soda fountain 
stools and booths with a blue
and silver color scheme that is very
attractive Bud Millis is in charge
of the place and is assisted by his
sister Mrs Charles Lipinski and Gordon
Rudkin

4 H B u ll Project
We must all admit that the 4 H
club boys who raised bull calves as a
4 H project during 1939 were rather
fortunate in that the project was a
financial success Much credit must
be given the boys for the very fine
job done in caring for the calves But
we must also admit that all conditions
were favorable for a good sale and
that our advertising program was a
success 
How about the project for 1940 
Yes we intend to purchase calves
again this winter for a similar project 
but we must follow a well defined
program to protect our purchasers
and to avoid over doing the
project We certainly can over do
the project by purchasing inferior
calves and by purchasing too many
calves 
Certainly the boys came out on top
financially This fact may lead many
boys to think that this project has no
other purpose other than to make
money Were this the only purpose
of the project the committee in
charge would drop the project at
once The main purpose of the project
is to give the 4 H club boys experience
in purchasing feeding and
taking care of the calf during the
first year of its growth It is only
through such experience that boys
learn to appreciate the value of good
animals as compared to poor animals 
By actually raising animals of this
type the boys will develop a desire
to improve their home herd 
The committee in charge feels that
a definite program must be followed 
1 Project will be limited to 4 H
club boys 12 years or older 
2 Animals must be purchased from
recognized herds with production records 
3 Animals must be purchased
from Bang s and T B free herds 
4 Dam must have a production record
of 350 lbs butter fat or better 
5 Before calf is purchased 4 H
club boy must have the consent of
the County Agent or the county 4 H
club committee 
6 Club member must have been
an achievement member in 1939 or
obtain permission from the county
agent 
7 The committee will not be responsible
for any calf reacting to the
Bang s test if they are not raised in
a Bang s free herd 
8 No loans will be granted by the
local banks for the purchase of any
4 H club bull calf unless the county
agent has checked the production records
of the herd and has agreed to
the purchase of the calf 
The above regulations apply only
to those bull calves purchased for the
4 H club bull project which are to be
consigned to the 4 H bull sale next
fall 
1940 Soil P rogram
Committeemen from all townships
attended an educational meeting at
the court house last Saturday to
learn the procedure which will be

Reports amanating from the department
of agriculture and western
Wisconsin cranberry raising regions
indicate that the state s cranberry
crop this season will exceed that of
any other crop in its history excepting
that of 1937 
Estimates place the 1939 yield for
Wisconsin at 105 000 barrels which
totals up to almost one sixth of the
entire nation s cranberry output 
Few people realize that western
Wisconsin the Monroe and Jackson
county regions are becoming cranberry
growing centers of the United
States Virtually the only areas that
can better our neighboring marshes
are those located in Massachusetts
which when most of us were youngsters 
were the only cranberry regions
mentioned in geography books 
Favorable climate and increasing diversity
of farming in this state however 
is now bidding to give the New
England state some stiff competition 
These facts and figures simply emphasize
once more the attractiveness
of western Wisconsin as a diversified
farming region Visitors here frequently
marvel at the variety of products
they observe growing in the
Coulee Region Many of them are
astonished to find tobacco raised in
the region yet the Vernon county
and Kickapoo valley tobacco ranks in
some respects as the number one
quality product grown in America 
All sorts of fruit and vegetables as
well as virtually every conceivable
grain and forage crop are common to
this section of the Mississippi river
valley 
Little heralded are these facts
about the La Crosse trade territory 
and yet they are probably the most
stabilizing factor existing in the consistent
progress of this section of the
state La Crosse Tribune

After a business meeting on Nov 
14 the Cue club enjoyed a play entitled
 Come Here 
The cast was as follows 
Actress Kathleen Horswill
Director Erwin Peterson
Boy Francis Smetana
The director after reading each
circumstance invited the actress interpretation
of the situation by using
only two words Come Here 
After the program the director
read each circumstance again and the
members in turn pretended they were
trying out for the part of Scarlett
O Hara and said Come Here giving
it as much expression as they
could 
wrong we still think you are swell 
I guess I am slipping or is it you

love and that happens to be Harlan

All year long young people ponder
over the question of whether they
might give a present to their favorite
person and if so what Because the
Christmas season is approaching the
Etiquette girls feel a discussion is in
order 
Here are some rulings on the matter 
A
girl should not consider remembering
a boy with a gift at Christmas
or any other time unless he has
remembered her on some other previous
occasion Here again as in letter
writing it is up to the boy to make
the first move Presents exchanged
between girls and boys should be of
a strictly impersonal nature For boys
this would include books magazine
subscriptions ties gloves monogrammed
handkerchiefs sporting equipment 
gadgets for the car brushes 
leather goods and the like Girls may
accept gifts such as flowers candy 
perfume purses books or anything
that might contribute to a hobby such
as scrap books dish accessories scarf 
handkerchiefs compact cosmetic kit 
or pictures 
I f you still have questions on this
subject or any other don t forget to
write them on a slip of paper and
drop them in the Etiquette Box

The President joined Secretary of
State Cordell Hull in stopping the
rush of our Merchant Marine vessels
from our own to foreign registries 
Their action probably is of greater
importance to the development of our
ocean lines than anything that has
transpired since the government started
dumping its cash into the seas to
build up a merchant marine in the
days following the World war At
last a halt has been called to the
manipulators who have made what
was regarded as a patriotic movement
largely a matter of money making
for themselves Congress which has
been more liberal with the ocean lines
than would seem warranted after repeated
scandals and flare ups may
now be inclined to tighten up on the
regulations at least 
One purpose which made the Merchant
Marine movement popular with
many people is that in time of war
the ships built largely with government
money would become available
for aiding naval operations Under
the contracts with the promoters 
even a transfer of registry would not
cancel that agreement but once the
vessels were placed under foreign
flags getting them back in time of
war might not be so easy 
It would not seem that there were
people who are afraid of the European
war coming to an end without
running its full course of four or five
years of destruction and devastation 
but the financial writers state some
of the larger speculators and business
interests are so concerned It is not
because they are so blood thirsty 
Plans now being made for a long
war will call for a billion dollars or
more of expenditures for war materials
and supplies by belligerent nations
in this country Committees of foreign
governments are now in the
country arranging for the contracts 
The industries some of which such
as war plane factories munition and
chemical plants etc are quickly expanding
their operations to meet the
demand Were peace to come those
operations would cease and even now
there would be a good sized business
slump which would be as dangerous
to the speculators as to the industries 
Hence the fear of those who
are looking to the destruction of a
big part of Europe as a source of
private profit I f their fears are important
now what will they be when
the war does close as it must eventually 
after billions have been spent
here in expanding industry to supply
the orders of war 
Incidentally the tax payers of our
own land have an interest in the foreign
orders and their effect upon our
own extensive preparations for national
defense The cost of materials
has advanced rapidly in a few weeks 
The building of our larger navy is
underway Expansion of government
and private navy yards is in progress 
The budget will call for an
additional one and one third billions
for the Navy from congress The
cost of battleships has gone from
$40 000 000 to more than twice that
amount in recent years Their cost
will again be greatly increased War
is an expensive game for countries
engaged and also to those countries
which prepare extensively in the fear
of involvement 
There are difficulties in keeping
abreast of the times in naval construction
as in many other things The
financial side is not the only one 
Departmental bureaus get notions of
their own infallibility and that is one
of the hardest to overcome There
is always a row on between advocates
of one plan and another A row of
that kind was one reason why congress
was called upon to decide the
matter of lighter than air warships 
There are other differences of opinion 
Very recently there was a shakeup
in the Navy department which
caused several bureau chiefs to be
sent out to field duty It was due to
mistakes in the construction of a
score or more of destroyer ships 
Not until they were completed did
it become apparent that they were of
faulty design and unstable for their
strenuous purposes Now an attempt
is being made to change them over
into real fighting craft a hard thing
to do When the storm broke the
usual attempt to shift responsibility
by the bureaus resulted in numerous
officials being transferred to other
posts Designing and constructing a
modern war machine is very intricate
work 
The Bureau of the Census has given
out a release on the big work it
will undertake in 1940 Organization
is still far from complete and the
bringing together of 7 000 employees
in the Washington office is a great
job in itself Except for such former
clerks and employees as have become
available by Civil Service reinstatement 
appointments are being made
from the registers of the Civil Service
Commission Most of them are
without departmental or other government
experience and assigning
them to such a wide range of activities
which will be new to them is
difficult for the organizing forces as
well as the employees 
The field workers will be selected
on the patronage basis but preliminary
tests as to efficiency may be imposed 
Only recommendations by senators
and representatives of the majority
party or the party committees
will be considered There will be
several state supervisors in each state 
Wisconsin to have three There also
will be 560 district supervisors each
of whom will make selections of his
office force Then there will be special
workers for different fields 
There will be 143 000 enumeration
districts and probably each township
will be so designated while cities will
have other units yet to be determined 
The Bureau announces that the
district supervisors probably will be
appointed early in December The
Bureau will publish the list for each
state as soon as the appointments are
made Then those desiring positions
as enumerators may file their applications
with the district supervisors 
who will give them consideration It
is probable that the appointment of

The Tuesday club entertained the
members of the Clio club on Wednesday
afternoon of last week with
Misses Mary and Jane Spaulding and
Mesdames F W Barber and W A 
Barber as hostesses Mrs Barber 
for a surprise treat for the program 
had secured the services of Mrs Charles
Phelan of Sparta for a reading of
 Victoria Regina 
Mrs Phelan at one time an artist
on Chautauqua circuits had more or
less given up her elocution work until
recently when she revived it to please
her mother by appearing on a program
at her home in Illinois She
states that she has been amazed by
the cordial reception given her on
her appearances recently There is no
reason why she would not receive a
cordial reception She presented
 Victoria Regina in an outstanding
manner and had the close and appreciative
attention of her audience
throughout the program She was
very ably assisted by Mrs Tyler Barney 
as soloist and Mrs Clare Van
Antwerp as accompanist their musical
numbers being woven into the
theme of her story Both are from
Sparta Mrs Walsh of Sparta also
accompanied the ladies Queen Victoria
is one of Mrs Phelan s favorite
characters and her reading is particularly
sympathetic in that the book
throws a different than usual light on
her character 
The big drawing room at the Spaulding
home made a fine place to present
the program and there were 65
members and guests present to enjoy
it At the close of the program refreshments
were served by the hostesses

I f you will open up your Bible 
and turn to the 27th chapter of the
Book of the Acts of the Apostles 
you may there read an interesting and
thrilling story It is the story of a
winter voyage in an overloaded ship 
nineteen centuries ago It is an interesting
study of several people and
several groups of people The story
concludes with a shipwreck and just
at the end of the chapter are these
arresting and suggestive words 
 Some on boards some on broken
pieces of the ship And so
they all escaped safe to land 
You have seen it in your newspapears 
and in your fiction and seen it
on the movie screens Fifty and a
Failure and perhaps a suicide is
the way out because of that sense of
failure 
But in that same Bible above referred
to you will find the story of a
man who at four score years made a
fresh start and left behind him a deposit
of usefulness equal to that of
any one man who has ever lived and
whose history is recorded in human
literature Moses was his name In
the same Book is the story of another 
named Abraham who started
afresh and lived greatly at only
about five years less attained age
than Moses Joshua is the name of
a third to do likewise the story is
in the same Book 
Futility and failure or endurance
and success That seems to be life s
choice for most people and perhaps 
for us most of the time 
Paul and his ship mates heard the
dread call Jump for your lives and
they jumped hanging onto whatever
their hands could grasp as they jumped 
Some sort of storm has damaged
most human lives or some part of
the life of almost every human individual
you know including doubtless 
yourself Today from every quarter 
come the cries of human wrecks 
their voices are heard above the
voices of war above the voices of industrial
differences above the voices
of political bickerings above every
voice from vale and hilltop from
jungle and fruitful plain arises the
cry of the humans whose lives in
some major part have been wrecked 
In a world at war a world groping
in uncertainty and insecurity this
story comes with a thrill as a firstaid
to the storm tossed dwellers of
earth hang on says the story hold
tight to the broken pieces you ll make
shore!
So many people have to live on 
and do live on with broken pieces of
health It is easy to say I can t
make it the old body is broken
down But where there is a real
will it says Wait I ll try again 
And so today a multitude of men and
women are going about their tasks
with a conspicuous leak in the ship
of health just refusing to go down 
swimming on broken pieces You ve
seen them one leg gone one arm
gone both legs gone both arms
gone one leg and an arm gone 
blind every sort of deficiency But
Robert Louis Stevenson wrote in rugged
style a great masterpiece between
the coughs of that dread disease 
when he was already too weak
to sit up 
A lot of people have to keep on
keeping on somehow when there are
only broken pieces of home left War
isn t the worst storm in our midst 
today We are in the midst of a terrific
storm this day in this America 
that is battering at our homes The
blasts of ill advised birth control of
quick and too easy divorce of enforced
idleness to say nothing of an
ever increasing number of morally
spineless men and women not only
tearing down civilization s safeguard
 but even removing the desire to rebuild
it 
What vast numbers of us have to
get along with bits of education 
just pieces Maybe there is too much
stress on college training in our day 
maybe there is too much value put
upon college degrees and diplomas 
That isn t the point the point is that
for vast numbers of us formal training
called education ended all too
soon and we have to make the best
of the broken pieces Well it isn t
hopeless That s all Abraham Lincoln
had or Booker T Washington And
they went places So can we Using
what we have the crest of some
wave will carry us on and in!
Broken pieces of life For life is
not whole for very many people 
Death leaves wreckage Disappointment
leaves wreckage Illness leaves
wreckag The selfishness and selfseeking
of others leaves us with
wreckage The selfishness and selfplans
and outreaching purposes and
even our own unselfishness The
wreckage of mankind is a vast and
most pitiable refuse pile 
A spark in the wrong place often
causes a fearsome conflagration But
a human castaway may become a redeeming
fire to a community or a
state or a nation or a whole wide
world It may be that you will be
such an one or that I w ill who may
know Hang on shore is not too
far off keep struggling even tho it
must be alone in the torrent and
tempest and tribulations of life 
Read in your Bible book about a
publican named Matthew He had a
banquet one day A Galilean named
Jesus was the guest of honor He
had done wondrous things at helping
Matthew make over the fragments of
his wrongly used life 
I f there be any Ship of Hope for
our life it is the Ship of which this
same Jesus is Captain I f He be not 
 then to whom shall we go 
But I m wondering about something 
It isn t even hinted at in the
story of our Scripture Do you suppose
everybody found a satisfactory
piece of something to hang to the
first time he reached Did everybody
have what it took to save himself
from that wrecked vessel in that icy
winter water Or did they have to
help each other even with pieces 
I suspect they did 
And my friends cheer up for
life is like that We may have only
pieces of health but there are fultitudes
who have only fragments 
only splinters indeed And even out
of our little strength we may help
those who have still less And they
will be blessed and we much more
than they 
Uncountable toothpicks are matchsticks
and pencils splinters and
fragments in unthinkable numbers 
but there is still wood left for fuel
and houses and schools and churches
and whatever else we need it for 
So we may take fragments from
our pieces and share them with those
still less fortunate than we We may j
even take splinters from our fragments 
and multitudes will find the i

Boys and girls wTho ride bicycles
should be careful Sixteen bicyclists
have so far lost their lives this year
in accident on Wisconsin streets and
highways That is the same number
that were killed during the entire
year of 1938 During the first ten
months of this year there were 130
serious bicycle accidents in Wisconsin 
An increase in bike accidents has
been noticed in the fall months due
no doubt to decreased visibility and
the longer hours of darkness during
which the boys and girls ride The
state law requires that bicycles be
equipped with a light in front and a
taillight or reflector in the rear when
used for night riding Carrying passengers
is another practice strongly
condemned

 Clean out your barred
And have a barrel of fun 
Clean out your barrel
And shoot your buck on the run 
might be the theme song for all the
hunters The seven days beginning
Saturday Be careful and not let
your white socks protrude over your
boot tops Carry a blue or a red
handkerchief for your snozzle because
anything white will draw fire
from any one nearby who might be
afflicted with buck fever As for the
whites of your eyes if you ve got
something on your hip to keep them
blood shot well that s alright too 
I ve heard many a story of how
one hunter shot another hunter but
the best I ever heard was of a young
Indian who while standing on a high
windfall near a point of land where
bears usually came up on dry high
land after browsing in the marshes
during the night shot what he took
for a bear and shot his own fatherin 
law After the old man was gotten
home he confessed that he was
trying to frighten the young man into
thinking that he was seeing a member
of an enemy war party and then
watch his run for home But it just
happened that he was not the kind of
young man that would run I can
just imagine the young man standing
there shot and wad bag slung over
one shoulder and the powder horn
slung over the other shoulder leaning
on his trusty muzzle loading shotgun
patiently waiting for any sign of big
game whereby he could prove his mettle
to the tribesmen of the village 
Then suddenly barely discernable in
heavy fog he sees something going
on all fours and never thinking it
could be a human being he blazes
away with both barrels Imagine his
discomforture when reaching the
place to see his wife s father lying
there with a mortal body wound 
I myself have hunted with muzzleloading
shot guns (my great grandfather s)
and I know how hard hitting
they can be 
Well anyway the young man was
cleared of all blame and in later years
became one of the great leaders of the
tribe 
I know not who wrote the following
very enlightening and strengthening
words but I do know this Anyone
who feels down and out and feels
everything is working against him and
feels there are too many obstacles
impossible to overcome one hindering
him from reaching his goal in life 
would read these words and ponder
over the circumstances under which
these words might have been written
he would soon see a different slant on
life and his morale restored 
 It matters not how hard the scroll 
I am the master of my fate and the
captain of my soul 
Maybe that I haven t just got the
right wording but anyway I ve always
thought that he must have been
a Progressive A man who believed
in fair and square dealing whether it
be in politics or individuals A man
who was a credit to the state a man
who was not daunted by anything 
not even big party coalitions A man
beloved and believed in by people of
the government for the government
and by the government

a faithful reader none other than the

his enjoyable article about his own

us more along the same line 
Our own particular Grandma came
all the way from Portland Oregon 
to pay us an all too short visit and
we are facing this next week end with
a real case of blues for it means we
must soon bid her goodbye Time
seems to walk on leaden feet when
we are so many miles apart but the
few weeks we have been together
seemed only days they passed so
quickly As an only daughter who
once hurt her very deeply by going so
far away to live I am learning in
full measure how very hard it is to
say goodbye May God keep her safe
and happy until we meet again

How our hearts should respond together
at this glad Thanksgiving season
for the many advantages we enjoy
in this land of ours Yet the
pressure of daily living will hinder us
in fully expressing our feelings to
God unless we will relax the tension
and strain by giving God a worthy
portion of our time How about you
and the family attending worship
somewhere We cordially invite you
to our church Its services and benefits
are free to all

Falls
Where the road runs through the
meadow
And the soil is smooth and black
Where the old gate lays the shadow
Of its bars across the track 
Where the gate post gives permission
For our vagrant feet to pass 
There a spot as blue as heaven
Lay upon the withered grass 
Had the violets forsaken
Their code of reckoning
And the autumn gold mistaken
For the sunshine of the spring 
Or perchance some heedless angel 
Hasting homeward through the skiea
Had let fall a piece of azure
In her hurry and surprise 
Every leaf and blade was withered 
Every blossom long since dead 
Every seed and rootlet sleeping
In a soft and earthy bed 
Not a flower could awaken
From its peaceful slumbering 
Nor was heaven s azure shaken
From an angel s trancient wing 
Though November skies were dreary
And the day was cold and late 
There the lovely blue fringed gentian
Stood beside the meadow gate

Sophomores 
The World History class has been
transported back to the days of the
Romans Each Friday splendid topics
on current affairs are given in order
to bring the students back to this
country and also to keep them well informed
as to what really is happening
in the world today 
Many famous seamstresses will be
saying in the future that they got
their background from the Home Ec 
class These girls expect to have
some very nice dresses ready for
Thanksgiving day 
The Algebra class took their six
weeks test last Monday and successfully
passed with fairly good marks 
They are now studying polynomials

Gossip 
By their words ye shall know them
(the gossips) 
Blair is said to be the home of red
heads According to last minute reports
Otis and Lillian were seen at
Blair last week at the pictures We
suppose the movie was Redheads on
Parade 
A certain ring is back to its owner
after a series of escapades Can it be
that this romance is on the rocks or is
it the ring that s lost its stone For
furher information ask A J W and
B C (before Christmas) 
Because of an unlimited supply of
knowledge the students are bringing
their heart problems to Josephine and
Robert who seem a little TOO capable
in answering all questions 
We are wondering where Glenn
keeps Birdine She is never home
nights 
The students are wondering if Allen
H is taking a course in Home Ec 
Perhaps he will be able to make toast
pretty soon It s about time 
Enigma Why is Norma H interested
in the saw mill Can it be that
she plans on entering the lumber business 
We find it hard to believe that
Mary goes to Hixton so often just to
see her folks A certain V 8 seems to
be involved in the case 
Latest motto of the senior class is 
 W P A here we come!

In this very captivating play Aunt
Susie (Norma Bemtson) is a manhating
spinster who has inherited an
old house from a former friend She
calls her favorite niece Miss Joy Herbert
(Norma Fagerness) to come and
live with her Joy brings along her
dusky maid Scarlett (Lois Smith) 
Lights flash off and on strange
visitors come and go there is a
crashing of glass and weird noises
come from the factory next door The
strange Madame Zola (Marian Hulett)
and the rough Slick Conway
(Alfred Waller Jr ) are trying to
spoil Miss Susie s plans 
Then to spoil all her plans an old
bachelor Omar Graves (Ralph Loken)
and his man servant La Salle (Ernest
Rumppe) enter the house which Mr 
Graves has also inherited To Joy s
dismay her future husband Johnny
(Maynard Amundson) turns up at the
wrong time Trying to straighten
everything out is Portia Lark (Valborg
Huseboe) the lawyer lady 
Added to the play are Cynthia
(Bemette Cewe) and Laura Dawson
(Esther Lien) who help build up the
plot to a dramatic climax when Aunt
Susie really and truly shoots the
works 
Remember Reserve this Friday
night Nov 24 for seeing Mrs Morken s
production of Aunt Susie
Shoots the Works It is a play that
you will long remember because it
is not only a mystery but a farce

The Taylor Cagers started the season
in grand style by beating Humbird
24 to 12 on Humbird s floor 
It was a close game until the third
quarter started and then Taylor pulled
away and won by a comfortable
margin 
Taylor started the scoring with a
field goal by Raymond Anderson but
Marohl of Humbird put them in the
lead with two field goals Their lead
was short lived when Hulett of Taylor
sank two goals The score at the
quarter was 6 to 4 Taylor s favor 
Humbird never led thruout the rest
of the game tho they came close because
the half ended 9 to 8 
Allen Hulett lea the Taylor offense
with 11 points Marohl led Humbird s
attack with four field goals
which totals up to 8 points Raymond
Anderson and Raymond Owen led the
defense for Taylor with some nice
rebound work 
Score by quarters

duties of her task difficult because on
shoulders of one fell the burden of
being both father and mother In late
years she took a sister and brother into
her home and gave them the best
of care in their sickness and helplessness 
Of kind disposition she was
ever ready to render service unto

the thought of a kind and helpful
brother and friend will linger on
