FORTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 12, 1939 NUMBER 4ft
Legislators Rack Home
Assemblymen and senators, at home
this week, can look back on a long and
weary legislative session; one that
lasted 269 days and thereby set a new
record for endurance. The legislators
can look forward to meeting again
soon too, because their failure to enact
sufficient revenue for state spending
indicates that they will be called back
into special session.
Prior to the adjournment hour of
4:15 p. m. Friday afternoon the senate
had passed a bill setting up a joint
interim committee consisting of eighteen
members, six from each party,
who will meet and decide upon a revenue
measure and report back to Gov.
Heil who will then call a special session.
Legislators appointed to the interim
committee are: Senators Bolens, Gawronski,
Young, Democrats; Nelson,
Kresky, Hampel, Progressives; Roe*
the, Coakley, and FreehofT, Republicans;
Assemblymen Tehan, Shimek,
Genzmer, Democrats; Biemiller, Alfonsi,
Hemmy, Progressives; Catlin.
Thomson, and Graas, Republicans.
Treasury Bare
Failure of the 1939 legislature to
enact a general revenue measure has
resulted in a prediction bv State
Treasurer John Smith that the state
will be virtually bankrupt by the
middle of December.
Treasurer Smith points out that
there is but 4 million dollars remaining
in the treasury and that revenue
w’hich can be anticipated during the
last three months of this year would
fail to cover expenditures for the same
period. He states that when the
money in the general fund is exnended
he will cease to write checks. Indications
at the present time are that
state employes would likely gn payless
the last two weeks of the year, he
said.
Earlier in the session, the state
emergency board, composed of the
Governor and the finance committee
chairman of each house, Assemblyman
McIntyre and Senator Mueller, has
stated that in the event state finances
were in doubt they would order a 25
per cent reduction in unallotted appropriation
balances. As this week begins
state departments and commissions
have been notified to this effect.
The notice said: “It may be necessary
to reduce unallotted approprintons
balances as much as 25 per cent because
of the seriousness of the financial
condition of the general fund.”
Sine Die
A sine die adjournment according to
the dictionary means adjournment
without appointing a day to convene
again. However, a more practical
meaning of a sine die legislature is
that it goes home without completine
all of its work, that many of the bills
and resolutions which have been introduced
do not receive final legislative
action or as the legislators term it
“die in the legislative hopper.”
Sine die adjournments are usually
spectacular affairs. Observers generally
find it a clamoring bedlam, with
legislators all seeking to obtain the
floor in order that their pet measures
might be brought in for action before
it is too late. More often thfcn not this
type of adjournment leads to filibusters.
A legislator wishing to prevent
a vote on a bill can talk for hours up
to adjournment and he has killed a bill
without allowing it to come to a vote
Friday’s adjournment gave promise
of a rousing ending, but then fell to a
calm close. The senate after adopting
a resolution for a 12 o’clock noon end
ing sent the measure over to the assembly
for concurrence. Senator Jess
Peters. Hartford, then began a twohour
filibuster to talk to death the reenactment
of codes. However, assembly
proponents of the code, aided by
proponents of the milk control law,
also pending in the senate,, refused to
act on the sine die resolution until they
were given assurance that the code
and milk bills were passed. At noon
Senator Peters yielded the floor in
order that a recess might be called,
After the recess a truce was in order.
The code and milk control bills were
passed and the legislatue adjourned.
Capitol Notes
Governor Heil has signed into law
bills which appropriate $10,000 to the
Disabled American Veterans convention
corporation of Green Bay; establish
new sanitation standards for milk
delivery to dairy manufacturing
plants; and increase contribution by
cities, police and firemen to police and
firemen pension funds. He rejected
bills which would have allowed fourth
class cities and villages to increase
property taxes for recreational purposes
from two-tenths to one half a
mill; and which would have allowed
Milwaukee to lease for low cost housing
purposes any lands acquired by tax
deed.
Two Progressive assemblymen, Paul
Alfonsi and Andrew Biemiller, have
challenged any two Republicans to
“debate the issues of this session with
us at any time or any place in the
state.”
The tax commission reports that the
state and its subdivisions collected
$201,368,105 in all types of taxes for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1939.
O f the amount 55.04 per cent came
from general property taxes; 17.04
per cent from motor vehicle taxes;
12.24 per cent from other special
taxes; 7.31 per cent from income
taxes; 6.56 per cent from special property
taxes; and 1.80 per cent from inheritance
taxes. The federal government
collected $86,406,220 in Wisconsin
during the same period.
As his 83rd honorary colonel Governor
Heil has named State Senator
Charles N. Orr, St. Paul, Minnesota.

Mr. Korting, agricultural instructor
in the Wittenberg High School, announces
that he plans to conduct
evening classes in the near future and
extends an invitation to all farmers
and young men in the surrounding
communities, who are interested in
agriculture, to enroll.
The first class will be held at the
agriculture room at the high school
next Thursday night, October 19, at
8 p. m., and will continue one night a
week for ten or fifteen weeks. There
are no enrollment fees connected with
the classes and the meetings are open
to anyone wishing to attend. The
meetings will be held in the agriculture
room which is equipped with both
milk and soils testing equipment and
a new library of agricultural books
and bulletins.
Those attending the classes decide
upon the subjects to be studied. In
the conduct of the school the experience
of all those attending is brought
into the discussion and supplemented
with experimental data or other information
that can be supplied by the
agricultural instructor. In the past,
most popular subjects have included
such topics as Farm Management,
Dairy Cattle Management, Soil and
Crop Improvement, Feeds and Feeding.
Swine and Poultry Management,
and Marketing.
Last fall quite a number of young
farmers attended these evening classes.
It is hoped that more will attend
this year and that a portion of the
time can be spent in recreation. Remember
the date, Thursday, October
19.

School Masters Meet at Antigo
The W olf River Valley School Masters
Club will hold its first meeting of
the year at Antigo Wednesday evening.
W. E. Switzer of the Langlade
County Normal will be the host while
Principal R. E. Clausen of Tgerton will
be the presiding officer. The speaker
of the evening will be E. G. Doudna.
president of the Wisconsin Education
Association and Secretary of the Normal
School Board of Regents. His
topic will be “Controversial Subjects
in Education.” The six school masters
of Wittenberg faculty plan to attend.
League Basketball?
A movement is afoot to organize the
cities and villages of the Wolf River
valley area into a basketball league.
W’ittenberg has been asked to join this
league. Whether they accept or not
will depend entirely on the enthusiasm
of local fans for amateur basketball.
Heretofore while connected with the
high school program it hardly justified
its existence from either the players’
or fans’ point of view. However, there
are a good many young men in the
community interested in playing basketball
indicated by last year’s city
league.
With the new gym the interest in
basketball among the high school boys
has more than doubled the number
taking part making it possible to have
two high school games an evening preceded
by a grade school game. Thus
city team games will be out of the
question, but if there are parties in
town that would organize and finance
a team it is very likely that enthusiasm
could be developed such as shown
for the Wittenberg baseball team.
Any persons or groups interested in
the development of a league should
correspond with Ray Hanson, editor of
the Clintonville Tribune, Clintonville,
Wisconsin.

This year’s class of 1940 will be the
40th class graduating from the W ittenberg
High School. During the past
40 years 615 young people have been
awarded diplomas from thfs institution.
Would it not be an interesting
affair to have as many of them a*
possible together again? This year
marking the 40th anniversary and
with the completion of the new addition
to the school plant should be a
fitting time to arrange for such a
gathering at which time a permanent
alumni organization should be set up
followed by a similar gathering each
year. Possibly a day during the
Christmas holidays will be a suitable
time. Beginning next week a portion
of the alumni list of names will appear
in this column. An attempt will
be made to bring it up to date regard
ing location and occupation. Any corrections
or additional information on
those marked unknown will be accepted
and the same should be mailed to
the principal’s office, Wittenberg.

Grade Athletic Conference Organized
Coaches, representing Aniwa, B irnamwood,
Bowler, Eland, Mattoon,
Neopit, Tigerton and Wittenberg, met
September 16 in the Wittenberg high
school and organized a grade athletic
conference. The coaches chose the
name, “Wolf River Valley Grade Conference.”
The following men were
elected as the 1939-40 officers: President,
R. E. Clausen of Tigerton; vice
president, C. H. Torbenson of Witten
berg; secretary and treasurer, C. R.
Bowers of Neopit.
The purpose of the conference is to
give as many boys as possible an opportunity
to play and take part in the
various sports, thus developing a desirable
attitude for fair play and good
sportsmanship between the towns, as
well as for the advancement of the
athletic program for the towns involved.
Each team in the conference is to
play two games with each of the
other teams a season. At present the
teams are engaged in the playing of
kittenball, however the officers will
meet October IH and arrange dates
for the basketball season. The 1939-
’40 basketball tournament, for the
conference schools, was awarded to the
Neopit Day School of Neopit, Wis.
Neopit’s location in the heart of the
forest and the Keshena Indian Reservation,
offers an ideal location for
sight seeing trips, particularly the
large lumber mill which is owned and
operated by the Menominee Indians.
Neopit also has a new school plant
equipped with a new gym arid a Home
Economics Department, suitable for
hot lunches for the visiting players.
Hoys Visit Madison; Shake
Hands with Heil
Thc largest state judging contest in
twenty-five years became history last
week when between twenty-three and
twenty-four hundred boys from one
hundred ninety-nine high schools in
the state competed for honors. A
judging team consisting of Norman
Johnson, Robert Heistad, and Jim
Ringstad. and F. F. A. delegate,
Roland Wendler, with their instructor,
Karl E. Korting, represented Wittenberg
at the contest. The judging team
turned in some good judging on several
classes of dairy and beef cattle,
swine, sheep, and horses, but did not
succeed in winning any special recognition.
One of the highlights of the trip was
the boys’ visit to the State Capitol
where they had the privilege of shak
ing hands with the governor. The
governor explained to the boys that he
was working in the interest of the
farmers and that in order to produce
a bettor dairy product we must keep
the flies out of the cheese.
Other points of interest seen on thc
trip were the Forest Products I^abora
tory, Vilas Park Zoo. WHA broadcast
ing station, University Museum, Col
lege of Agriculture and the Game
Farm at Poynette.
The groun stayed at Kleinheinz Hall,
a part of the Short Course Dormitory,
while in Madison and attended the
Wi consin-Texas football game on
Saturday.

Miss Gunda Christiansen, a Wittenberg
girl now employed in Chicago,
had a unique experience when she
rode the prize-winning Salt Lake City
white feathered float as queen in the
parade staged in Soldier’s Field,
Chicago, by the American Legion at
its recent national convention in that
city.
She acted in this role as double for
the queen from Salt Lake City who
became ill while in Chicago. The committee
in charge of the Utah float
selected Miss Christiansen from a
group of many girls that happened to
be lounging in the lobby of the city’s
largest hotel at the time the committee
found itself facing the necessity of
finding a girl to act as queen in its
elaborate and expensive float if it
was to be entered in the parade.
The committee had difficulty in convincing
Miss Christiansen that it was
not a Legion joke or a trick, when
they accosted her and asked her to act
as a float queen. But they were able
to do so and led her to a suite of
rooms in the hotel, where women attendants
soon had her enrobed in an
entrained white chiffon gown covered
with white feathers.
After that it was not long before
she was atop the float and enjoying
one of the greatest thrills of her life
as the procession passed along a route
lined with tens of thousands of cheering
people.

The Song of the Lazy Farmer
The tang of Autumn’s in the air, the
leaves are falling ev’rywhere, the season’s
work is almost done and almost
ev’ry day the sun sets earlier than day
before, the summer’s laboring is o’er.
The crops are almost gathered in,
they’re filling up each mow and bin
and right abundantly the soil has paid
us for the season’s toil. Dame Nature
has been mighty nice and now if we
should have for what we grow, our
bank account would blossom so, we
wouldn’t need to think, by heck, whenever
we have writ a check that mebbe
we have overdrawn, and find our balance
all is gone. I like to store the
crops away, and if the market doesn't
pay, it’s satisfaction just to know that
we’ve raised feed a-plenty so the stock
can eat t.he winter through, if we ain’t
got much revenue. To get rich, take
my advice and don’t raise crops, because
the price won’t make of you a
millionaire, for taxes have to have
their share, and int’rest, too, takes
quite a lot; before you know it you
ain’t got a whole lot left, the price of
oats will not suffice to pay your notes.
Yet even if there ain’t much mon in

A lap shous European sphere-of influence division and resultant conflicts. Numbered
explosions show probable sues af conflict between "triangle" members:
ONE—lialtic sea, long an exclusively German area, becomes a Russian sea following
tiny Estonia's capitulation to Moscow. Russia thus becomes naval threat to
Reich.
TWO—Russ, Nazi interests and nationalities clash here; Lithuania falls in both
Spheres of influence.
THREE—Rumania in German sphere, yet Russia will probably force partial dismember
ment by demanding return of Bessarabia und cesium of south portion to
Bulgaria. Rumania also essential to Russ “Black sea pact.'*
FOUR—Balkan states, partially in Nazi-ltalian spheres, are predominantly Slavic,
not Teutonic or Latin, therefore lean Moscow-wise.
FIVE—Italian, German spheres clash in Yugo-Slavia, which each seeks to dominate.
Italy fears German victory would make her a Mediterranean power, thus
threateninu Mussolini's domination there. Italy further sees herself left in the cold
by Russ-Nmzi division of Eastern Europe.
S IX —Turkey, in Russian sphere, is foe of Italy, since that nation covets Turkey’s
Dodecanese islands.

D ip lo m a tic F ront
As September died, U. S. correspondents
visiting Germ any’s Siegfried
line found idyllic peace (see
WESTERN FRONT). The war was
being fought elsewhere, in London,
B erlin and Paris, but chiefly in Moscow
w'here Dictator Josef Stalin was
teaching Adolf Hitler the danger of
playing with flre. Signed by the
Nazi-Soviet second men, Foreign
Ministers Jo ach im von Ribbentrop
and Viacheslav Molotov were
treaties (1) pledging “ necessary
m easures” if Britain and France refused
Adolf H itler’s peace, (2) partitioning
Poland to give the Reich a
bigger slice than under the original
m ilita ry demarcation, and (3) stim ulating
trade between the two nations.
Joachim von Ribbentrop returned
to Berlin in high spirits, handing
Boss Hitler the weapon of Russian
co-operation with which he hoped to
force peace upon the allies. But
H err Von Ribbentrop had paid dearly
for this w'eapon, and the allies
were not entirely displeased. The
price had been extension of Russian
influence into
B a lt i c an d
B alkanlands
tow'hich Berlin
once held
c l e a r title.
M o i e o v e r
Von Ribbent
r o p h a d
signed away
Ita ly ’s title
to B a lk a n
R IB B E N T R O P
a p p a r e n t ly
I aid . big price. without con'
suiting Signor Mussolini.
Russian gains were m any: She
took over Estonia, thereby becoming
a Baltic naval power. She extended
sway over Latvia and barked
at little Lithuania's door, where Hitler
has long been kingpin. She got
Poland's oil and wheatfields, looked
hungrily at Hitler's R um ania, made
a pact with Bulgaria and another
w ith Turkey.
The allies were pleased for several
reasons. First: The entire
sphere-of-influence was such a hopeless
jum ble of mixed nationalities
and conflicting ambitions that a
blowup was considered inevitable.
Second: Two ambitious and ruthless
dictators, once isolated from each
other, now worked side-by-side with
r o buffer state between them to absorb
the shock. Third: Russia
could not be expected to give the
Reich much immediate economic
help, because her own mobilized
armies require first attention. Moreover,
Polish oil wells had been rendered
unproductive for a year.
U extern Front
The allies prepared for a mighty
Nazi offensive when they refused
H itle r's peace, but for the moment
all was quiet. A. P .’s Louis Lochner
and U. P .’s Frederick C.
Oechsner visited the Siegfried line,
finding French and Nazi troops fishing,
washing clothes and whittling.
But in the Saar sector the French
continued to advance, while overhead
there was occasional fierce
fighting.
Aerial F ront
Conflicts between planes brought
conflicting reports. London adm itted
some planes “ have not yet returned”
from a raid over Helgoland’s
German sea base in the
North sea, and Berlin reported five
of the six raiders were shot down.
Two days later London told of a
miracle: Over the western front, a
five-plane British reconnaissance
squadron was allegedly attacked by
15 German fighters. Three British
ships were shot down, a fourth
forced to land, but the fifth “ flew
on to finish the jo b ,” shot down two
Nazi planes and forced the remaining
13 to flee because they were
“ shaken by the steady and accurate
fire” of the lone British plane.
Naval Front
Three Norwegian steamships were
sunk by Germany in one day; next
day the Reich seized three Danish
vessels. Apparent reason: Germany
has decided everything is contraband
of war, which U. S. cashand-
carry advocates maintained
was good reason American ships
should stay out of belligerent
waters.
War Miscellany
C Poles in France, planning a strong
army, appealed to U. S. Poles to
come abroad and fight.
C Experts figured Europe is spending
$61,000,000 of the W'orld’s wealth
on war each day.
C In London, Britain called 250.000
more men to the colors, including
all men between 20 and 22, with
exceptions.
A G R I C U L T U R E :
Profit
Signed last June 23 was a U. S.-
British barter treaty with dual purposes:
(1) to deplete surplus U. S.
cotton and British rubber holdings,
and (2) to build up for each nation
a supply of strategic war materials
which must be held in reserve for
seven years unless either goes to
war. By early October it looked
like the god of war had netted
Uncle Sam a $20,000,000 profit on
his deal.
Reason: When the pact was
signed quantities of rubber and cotton
involved had about an even
value on the world market. But a
month of Europe's conflict forced
highly important rubber up some 30
per cent, from 15.48 cents to 21 cents
a pound Meanwhile cotton declined
from 9.53 to 8.85 cents a pound.
With first cotton shipments to
Britain underway from new O rleans,
U. S. boats prepared to pick
up the first consignment of British
rubber at Singapore on October 15.

D O M E S T I C :
Congress
Simple enough in early phases of
neutrality discussion was the proposition
of lifting the arms embargo,
restricting U. S. ships from belligerent
zones and holding belligerent
credits to 90 days. But when hairsplitting
starts, it is hard to stop.
As congress opened debate on the
issue, administration forces claimed
65 senators (16 better than a m a jority)
favoring cash and carry neutrality.
But m any an adm inistration
supporter soon found himself
just as bellicose as Isolationists
Nye, Borah and Lundeen.
Typical was Colorado’s Edwin C.
Johnson. Though he favored lifting
the embargo, the 90-day credit
clause stuck in his throat: “ There
is nothing to keep an individual
in a belligerent country from buying
in large quantities and turning
the goods over to the government.”
Thus he and m any another senator
wanted 90-day restrictions enforced
against not only the warring
nations but their residents as well.
At least two more issues threatened
to split repeal backers:
(1) The clause imposing ja il sentences
on Americans traveling in
forbidden combat areas. Said Senator
Johnson’s fellow Coloradoan,
C O LO R A D O ’S JOHNSON
He was for and against.
Alva Adams: “ F or years we’ve
been trying to preserve the rights
of our citizens, and now we propose
to make felons out of them
when they try to exercise their
rights.”
(2) The clause empowering the
President to designate combat areas
in which American ships could not
travel. Presumably this meant
U. S. ships must not only avoid
Baltic, North and Mediterranean
seas, but must also steer clear of
A ustralia, New Zealand, B rita in’s
Caribbean possessions, and even
Canadian ports. Unless modified, it
meant U. S. merchant ships must
not only lim it themselves largely to
western hemisphere routes, but
m ust even then watch their p ’s and
q ’».
Repercussions

President spikes notion of
politics being adjourned during
the emergency . . . Com-
/taring Chamberlain's problem
and that of Roosevelt's
. . . Political speculation now
centers largely around Vandenberg
. . . Lifting of all
sugar quotas regarded as a
constructive action.
WASHINGTON.—Two moves by
President Roosevelt effectually
spiked the notion of “ politics being
adjourned” during the emergency.
One was the President’s refusal to
accept Alf M. Landon’s challenge
that Roosevelt issue a statement
saying he would not be a candidate
for a third term. The other was
the White House explanation of
why Landon was invited to the neutrality
conference at all.
Landon was invited, the White
House explained, because he was
the “ titu lar head” of the R ep u blican
party, since he had been that
p arty ’s last candidate for President.
The explanation as to why Landon
and F rank Knox, Landon’s running
mate in 1936, were invited came
as a result of a question by newspaper
men as to why Herbert C.
Hoover was not invited. Coming,
as it did, on the heels of the talk
about politics being adjourned, this
was more or less of a joke. When
a government seeks to adjourn politics,
of course, it always calls in
the heads of the opposition. So far,
so good, but Landon is not the head
of the opposition to the New Deal,
and nobody knows it better than
F ran klin D. Roosevelt himself.
When the w ar emergency came
in' Britain, P rim e Minister C h am berlain
called in Anthony Eden and
Winston Churchill. Why? Because
they had been the real leaders, in
the minds of the British people,
against the Chamberlain policies.
Actually, Chamberlain did not call
them into the cabinet until after he
had abandoned the policy they had
opposed—appeasement. He did not
call them in u ntil he was ready to
follow the policies that C hurchill and
Eden had been advocating—war
rather than more appeasement.
C o m p a rin g C h a m b e rla in $
A c tio n ff ith R o o se v e lt's
Cham berlain did not call in leaders
who were going to oppose his
new policy. He
would have had to
call in pacifists, who
had been and still
were as far on the
one side of h im as
Eden and Churchill
were on the other.
Of course that would _
have been unthinka- J H
ble when war had
been decided u p o n
It would have been
comparable to the C h am b e rlain
President’s calling in Senators W illiam
E . Borah, Gerald P. Nye and
A rthur H. Vandenberg to the neutrality
conference.
There is another difference that
must be noted. Cham berlain gave
Eden and Churchill im portant posts
in the government. Roosevelt was
only asking Landon and Knox to a
secret conference. F urther than
that, he attempted to circumscribe
the publicity wrhich should be given
out about the conference.
Curiously enough, this so irritated
Landon that he did not go as far in
endorsing the President’s side of the
neutrality controversy as he had intended
to do before coming to Washington!
As a matter of fact the
statement he had intended to make
public on arriving in Washington,
but which Republican House Leader
Joe M a rtin persuaded h im net to
give out, went all the way in endorsing
repeal of the arm s embargo.
It was this same irritation of L andon
which resulted in his subsequent
call on Roosevelt to disavow
intentions for a third term , which
annoyed Roosevelt more, incidentally,
than anything that has happened
for a long time.
V . S . in E u ro p e a n C o n flic t
W o u ld B o o st R o o se v e lt
If Washington observers in both
parties are right in figuring that
the European war will last a long
time, and that eventually the United
States w’ill get into it, thc political
results inside this country are im ponderable.
Best judgm e nt is that
this situation would m ake the re-
, nomination of F ran klin D. Roosevelt
almost a certainty, with the
strong probability that he wrould be
re-elected.
If there is any political lesson to
be learned by the course which the
| American people followed in the last
war, enthusiasm for the war party
comes first, and resentment for getting
us into it lags behind. No one
at the time doubted the vast m a jority
of the people were behind
Woodrow Wilson through 1917 and
1918— right up until his appeal for
a Democratic congress. Individual
reports from congressional districts
nnd from states in*which senators
ere up for election conclusive
j that President Wilson would have
* retained control of congress had
he not m ade that appeal.
Y et in 1920 there was no doubt
whatever that resentment against
the Wilson A dministration for getting
us into the war played a big
part in rolling up that tremendous
m ajo rity against Jam e s M. Cox,
which swept Warren G. Harding into
the White House.
To cite a specific illustration, C larence
C. D ill was a representative
from the Spokane district of the
state of Washington, and as such
voted against declaring war. He
was beaten in the next election as
a result. But—a little later he was
elected to the United States senate
largely because the state approved
his vote on the war issue! He rem
ained in power, incidentally, long
enough to help in the nomination
of F ranklin D. Roosevelt in 1932.
S p e c u la tio n N o w C en ters

Washington speculation centers
largely at the m oment around Sen.
A rthur H. Vandenberg.
He has ad- %
vanced in the last j P ® :
few months to be - Jfi
the odds-on favorite | . J f e
for the Republican
presidential nomina- j ’
tion next year. Cer- '
tainly he was well
ahead of New Y ork’s
District Attorney d u O L
Thomas E. Dewey, ||Pg *
who had been No. 1
in the winter book Sejla ‘®r
for some time. \andenberg
Now we have Vandenberg and his
chief opponent, Sen. Robert A. Taft
of Ohio, in opposite camps on the
neutrality issue, with the obvious
probability that they will continue
on opposite sides of every question
which comes up affecting the war.
If Vandenberg were no older than
Dewey this might be an ideal situation
for the Michigan 'aspirant.
He could let Taft take the 1940 nomination
aw’ay from h im , be beaten
by Roosevelt, and then sweep into
office, as Harding did, after the inevitable
reaction has come. In this
case, in 1944.
Not that Vandenberg will be too
old in 1944. He will be only 60. But
at his present age that seems a
long time to wait. Also, he is in
daliger of becoming shopworn. By
1944 he will have been talked about
and rejected as the presidential
nominee ever since most of the
younger delegates can remember.
More im portant, he will have been
casting votes in the senate—assuming
he is re-elected next time (for
otherwise he would be relegated to
the has-been class and not considered
at a ll)—every one of which will
be a potential danger to his chances.
L ift in g A l l S u g a r Q uotas
A C o n stru c tiv e A c tio n
Unquestionably the most constructive
action taken by the adm inistration
against the probability—as insiders
in the government see the
picture—of a long war was the action
of President Roosevelt in lifting
all sugar quotas.
In September, 1919, nearly a year
after the Armistice, the prevailing
j retail price of sugar in the United
i States was 25 cents a pound. There
were some instances of 30 cents
being charged, but 25 cents was general.
During the war itself regulation
held dowTi the price to 11
cents, but there was an acute shortage,
sugar was rationed, and people
who had their meals at restaurants
were given tiny individual portions
instead of being offered the oldfashioned
bowi.
Whereas just recently, before the
war became a certainty, sugar w'as
sold at chain stores for 10 pounds
for 45 cents! And would have been
cheaper had it not been for the
quota system.
It is fair to adm it at this point
that 41 2 cents a pound for sugar is
lower than it should be, if those who
produce it are to be adequately compensated.
Sugar is the one and
practically only article of general
consumption which has not doubled
in price in the last 35 years.
There is no objection on the part
of the government to sugar producers
m aking a living. In fact it
is the policy to encourage a mild
rise in sugar prices. But not as skyrocketing,
such as occurred after
the removal of the World war restrictions,
and not a shortage.
S h a rp R is e in P ric e H e ld
D ow n b y P re sid e n t's M o ve
The world is producing more sugar,
or more accurately, has a potential
sugar production much greater
now than in the World war days.
It was only in 1929 that Henry L.
Stimson, fresh from the governorship
of tne Philippines, told a congressional
committee that it would
be impossible for the islands to produce
more than 500,000 tons of sugar
a year. The Philippines within a
couple of years after that pushed
their production to more than 1,000,-
000 tons.
But now every sugar producing

of Norwood’s humor. So she
felt exasperated.
R undhia smiled and plucked a
chord or two: “ Ever hear this one?”
He sang beautifully. His voice
was a good tenor, and he handled
the guitar with care. He avoided
Norwood’s eyes. He sang to Lynn.
The words meant nothing to her, but
she couldn’t fail to perceive the passion
suggested by the B-flat minor
melody. At the end of a stanza,
Norwood interrupted:
“ D am n that stuff, Ru nd h ia! Sing
something decent.”
Rundhia passed him the guitar.
He thought he had h im at a disadvantage:
“ You sing,” he answered. “ Perhaps
you know something for good
little boys and girls. Do you know
any hym ns?”
Norwood surprised both of them.
He took the guitar and changed the
tuning, struck some chords at random
and then played the thing better
than Rundhia could. He felt his
way through one air to another, until
he found one that suited his mood.
Then he trolled out Kipling’s “ On
the Road to Mandalay.”
He had a fine voice, baritone, and
he could whistle the chorus instead
of repeating fam ilia r words. It
wasn’t great art, but it was manly.
I t was decent. Where there “ weren’t
no Ten C ommandments,” Norwood
plainly had inviolable standards of
his own.
"A s usual, the Army roars its slogans
to the sky,” said Rundhia. “ I
can imagine you in love with a Burmese
woman, Norwood. Why not
apply for a Rangoon b illet?”
“ And miss this?” Norwood answered.
He was looking at Lynn.
“ Here’s your guitar. Are we goin
g ? ”
He offered Lynn his arm and she
was too astonished to refuse. He
wasn’t her rightful escort. She hardly
knew him , and what she did
know had annoyed her. However,
she found herself walking beside
h im with her arm in his, and there
was nothing for Rundhia to do but
to follow them down the ancient
steps until the garden path was wide
enough for three abreast. Norwood
pressed Lynn’s arm to m ake her listen.
He spoke so low that she could
hardly hear him :
“ The Maharanee is a dotard on
Rundhia. You can’t depend on her
for that reason. Leave Kadur the
m om ent your aunt is fit to trav e l."
“ Oh, you can’t guess—”
“ Yes, I know. I was an orphan.
1 was raised on stupid discipline
and fossilized injustice—Oh, hello,
Rundhia, you there? Thought you’d
stayed behind to pray or something.”
Rundhia was grinding his teeth.
He d id n ’t answer.
Lynn took pity on h im : “ When
will you show me the treasure
xoom?”
“ When we’re alone,” Rundhia answered.
Then, spitefully: “ Ours is
one of the few treasures that haven’t
found their way to London.”
“ You mean the others were plund
ered?” Lynn asked.
“ Pawned,” said Norwood.
After that they walked in silence
to the palace front door.
“ Good night,” said Rundhia pointedly.
Norwood smiled. “ I ’ll ask you to
be kind enough to see me to the gate,
Rundhia. The guard let me out once
tonight. They might think I ’m my
own ghost if I turn up alone. Miss
H arding, you know why the beautiful
Indian g in s are locked up in
zenanas, don’t you?”
“ Is that a conundrum? No, why?”
“ Because good-looking Indian men
would be ashamed of ’emselves if
they couldn’t make Casanova look
like a mere am a teu r.”
“ Are you being rude?’*
Rundhia came to her aid: “ E xcuse
h im , Lynn! Soldiers fold their
tents and leave their girls behind
them. They suppose all women are
alike. He meant it as a friendly
warning not to trust m e .”
Lynn stood at bay on the palace
•teps. It was on the tip of her
tongue to insult Norwood so thoroughly
that hp would never presume
to speak to her again. She wasn’t
quite sure he didn't expect that.
But she glanced from one m an to
Ihe other and changed her mind.
“ How about a stroll as far as the
guesthouse to find out how your aunt
is ? " Rundhia suggested.
“ Thanks, no. There’s a phone in
m y bedroom. I will use that. Good
night. Good night, Captain Norwood.”
CH APT ER VI
Norwood changed into khaki and
followed O ’L eary’s lantern. O ’Leary
was nervous, talkative, deliberately
disrespectful. Being only one-third
Irish, two-thirds of his truculence
was assumed, not genuine. However,
Norwood understood that.
“ Someone,” said O ’Leary, “ must
have overheard us talking near the
palace gate. I was followed to camp.
Heard him . Couldn’t see him. We’re
followed now. They’ll take your
number down unless you watch out.
A ll you officers believe, because
your uniform was made in London,
that you’ve only got to call the police
and—”
“ Shut up.”
“ All right, strafe m e! That’s the
Army for you. I'm not Army. I ’m
an underpaid civilian supernumerary.
Sack me if you want to.
O ’Leary resumed his discourse:
“ Then believe this: while you was
beneath the waterfall, but O ’Leary
crashed him , shoved, almost fell in,
too, but scrambled—regained his
footing—attacked the cobra—beat it
with the long stick, slew it.
“ Now are you satisfied! Lied to
you, did I? Going on in through the
hole, or acting sensible? Want to
know how it feels to be pitched
in the dark down a diamond m ine ?”
“ Back to c am p ,” said Norwood.
“ Thank you, I'll take whiskey!
Watch your step, and watch your
Uncle Moses. If I signal, don’t call
me a liar, duck q u ic k !”
"M y report is likely to carry
weight.”
performing an officer’s job wi’ a
banjo and a beauty, I sat thirsty
by the camp-fire, so the smoke ’ud
keep the skeeters off me, hoping for
one o’ m y spies to show up. But
came along a m an I don’t know.
Crep’ up surreptitious. Spoke Punjab
i, mispronouncing it. It weren't
his right language. Says he: ‘How
m u c h ?”
“ Gave you money?”
“ Not one anna! He wanted to
know your price to side with the
priests against the M aharajah .”
“ What did you tell h im ? ”
“ Nothing.”
"W h a t did you d o ?"
"H e was gone too quick. I missed
him with the new iron skillet what
the cook had stuck to clean itself
among the embers. Damned nigh
red-hot. If I ’d hit him, he’d h a’
sizzled. Po\nt is that whoever sent
him will be figuring they tried the
wrong diplomacy. Next thing, knife
or bullet. Dodge ’em and look out
for poison. Make the cook taste
everything and then bury the cook.
From now on, I eat nothing. Even
whiskey ain’t safe. They can drill
and plug the bottle; but it kills more
comforting than ground glass or
bamboo fiber. The priests know you
dined at the palace tonight. They’re
dead sure the M aharajah greased
your palm . Well—there’s where the
dump is. ’T ain’t safe to go closer.”
“ Wait here,” said Norwood.
O ’Leary picked up a stick. He
shadowed Norwood along the footpath,
until Norwood peered beneath
the waterfall. He had to stand on
a slippery ledge of rock. As O 'Leary
had foretold, the moon’s rays did
wanly penetrate, but it was torchlight
that revealed the tunnel-mouth.
Norwood stood there for several
minutes watching spectral figures
d um p blue clay from baskets, to be
carried away by the river.
“ Look o u t!” yelled O ’Leary.
Norwood jumped. A living cobra,
flung by an unseen hand, struck his
face—fell writhing—struck—missed,
i Norwood almost fell into the vooi
As foster-mother, Aunty Deborah
Harding had neglected no detail of
L y n n’s social education. Whatever
Lynn did, she did well. She had
been taught to ride perfectly. On
one of the M a h a ra ja h ’s thoroughbreds,
in the early morning cool,
she looked worthy of the splendid
a n im a l that she controlled with no
visible effort. Lynn, the mystic In dian
daybreak and the vigor of her
motion through the long mauve
shadows, were all one merriment
to make a m a n ’s eyes widen and
his heart leap.
One could recognize Rundhia from
a mile off by the way he swung his
right arm at the trot, an unconscious
habit that it had been nobody’s
business to tell h im about.
But Rundhia could ride, too. They
were a pair to stop and gaze at.
Lynn seemed to have forgotten
the previous night’s disagreement.
She appeared glad to see Norwood:
“ What are you doing up so early
? ”
“ The sight of you on horseback is
better than sleep,” he answered. “ I
had dreams about you.”
“ Bad ones?”
“ I can’t remember. You know
how dreams escape you when you
wake up.”
“ Come along for a gallop."
“ Can’t. Sorry.” Looking at Lynn’s
eyes, thinking about Rundhia, Norwood
spoke unguardedly: “ My man
is signalling—some people waiting
for me near the waterfall. I must
go. I will call as soon as I can.”
He looked straight at Rundhia.
It was then that Lynn noticed that
R undhia and Norwood hadn’t spoken.
“ Should I introduce y o u ?" she
suggested, laughing.
Norwood saluted her, wheeled his
horse, and rode away, not looking
backward. He heard Rundhia laughing.
O ’Leary met h im by the river, full
of self-importance:
“ You should send me to Geneva!
I ’m a diplomat. They’re waiting.
If you’re nice, and no one’s looking
they may let you see the mine. I
convinced ’em that all you’re here
for is to blow the government’s nose.
It needs blowing, I told ’em, on account
of some sneak squealing on
’em that their mine isn’t safe for
laborers, and you’re here to muzzle
the talk .”
“ I would like to muzzle you,"
said Norwood.
“ Same as it says in the Bible
about muzzling the ox that grinds
your c om ,” O ’Leary answered.
Norwood studied h im a moment.
There wras only one way to get the
value out of O ’Leary. No use m aking
him sulky. Keep him busy.
“ Go to the baza ar,” he ordered.
“ Here’s some money. Pick up all
the palace gossip that’s going the
rounds.”
“ I get you! Smell a rat—just smell
h im and I ’ll catch him . This isn’t
much money.”
“ It's all you’re going to get."
“ One o’ these d ay s," said O ’Leary,
“ I ’m going to hire a secretary
and take a chance with the Official
Secrets Act and dictate m y m em oir*.
Page one. I ’ll tell ’em th t
Intelligence is run by cheap 'uns.
They’d make a Scotchman feel lik t
multiplying loaves and fishes, free
for n o thing !"
.Norwood rode alone along the rlv- |
er bank until the path grew narrow
near the waterfall and he could no
longer see the huge bulk of the temple,
nor even the city wall that foi- !
lowed the curve of the river beyond
the d am . He dismounted and hitched i
his horse to a shrub. The water
tumbled innocently, lazily over the
d am ; there was hardly a hit behind
that beautiful curved translucent !
screen there might be the mouth of
a tunnel. The river water was j
vaguely blue.
There were four men seated near 
the ledge on which Norwood had
nearly lost his life the night before.
They stood up, greeting him respectfully.
They were Brahmins but not
priests; they looked like responsi- j
ble men of affairs who might, per- 1
haps, be trusted with the financial
details of some of the temple busi- 1
ness. He plunged straight to his subject:
“ One of our Air Force pilots has
reported having glimpsed an open
opit surrounded by those outlying
buildings near the temple area. It ’a
an open secret that the priests have j
been working a diamond mine for j
centuries. We have heard the mine
is dangerous. I want a secret look
at it. Perhaps I can advise you
how to make it safe. One other i
thing: stop dumping clay in the river.
Perhaps I can advise what to
do about that. As for the dispute j
about ownership, my party is run- i
ning a survey line to establish facts.
I have seen nothing yet to suggest ]
that the priests are not the rightful
owners. If you’ve any documents,
I ’d be glad to see them. My
report isn’t the last word, but it's
likely to carry weight."
If Norwood hadn’t been thinking
about Lynn and Rundhia, he might
have noticed that the Brahmins
looked a lot too pleased. One of
them, pushing past him, slipped a
tiny black paper envelope into Norwood’s
left-hand tunic pocket. He
apologized for having brushed
against him . Norwood h?d hardly
noticed that he did.
The four held a whispered consultation.
Then their spokesman said,
in excellent English, but with a
trace too m uch silk in his voice:
“ We appreciate your honor’s courtesy.
But we are intermediaries, on
whom it is incumbent to convey the
message to the proper quarter. It
shall doubtless have immediate consideration.”
He paused, then added,
as if choosing an innocuous polite
phrase: “ We know well that your
honor’s report will have great
weight. We hope that your honor’s
judgm ent may not be influenced by
worthless arguments."
Back in camp, Norwood sat under
the tent awning to have his boot*
polished by his servant, while he
gave orders for the day.
“ Sergeant Stoddart,” he said suddenly.
"There’s a middle-aged lady
in the M a ha raja h ’s guesthouse who
had a rather bad spill yesterday.
Bruises. Perhaps abrasions. Might
be complications if she isn’t careful.
A Bengali doctor is attending
her, and you can’t always depend
on those fellows to use fresh antiseptic.”
“ I ’d be awful sick, before I ’d let
one of ’em dose me, sir.’*
“ Well, before you go down to the
river, take a look in m y medicine
chest. You’ll find a new two-ounce
bottle of iodine. I think I ’ll take it
to her. Wrap it up so that it won’t
break. I ’m going to see the Resid
e nt."

Q F ALL the enthusiams taking
^ the world of fashion by storm
this season, there is none that exceeds
the mad rush that is now on
for gorgeously gay plaids and
stripes.
The showings in plaids and stripes
includes types for every occasion,
informal or formal. When you want
informality the biggest daytime hit
of the season is the richly colorful
wool clan plaids and if you are a
connoisseur on plaids you can get
clan patternings and colorings that
are authentic. Robin Hood reds, forest
greens, golden yellows, radiant
browns and heather tones mingle in
one grand splurge of gay color that
makes merry throughout the whole
program of fashion this season and
we mean just that for everything
from hats to bags, gloves to wear
with cloth coats and suits and entire
costume ensembles is being
made of plaid (or stripes if you
please) this season.
As to formal evening occasion,
have you seen the gorgeous metalthreaded
silk and wool stripes that
are being made into jackets, blouses
and skirts for dine and dance wear?
If not, the joy of anticipation is
yours. The newest dinner dresses
contrast fabrics and colors after
the manner shown to the right in
the picture. In this instance the
skirt is of yellow jersey, topped with
a jacket-blouse of yellow metal cloth
horizontally striped in exotic greens
and orange, and stripes of glittering
gold weave.
A strikingly beautiful dinner gown
is pictured below to the left. The
shirtwaist top is of lustrous black
velvet. The long flared skirt of
sheer wool is plaided in brilliant
tones of gold, green, cyclamen and
deep wine. Two large buttons con-

In reviewing the history of labor
unions the Am ericana points out
that organizations of laborers have
existed from tim e im m em o rial and
that the guilds of the Middle ages
were exclusive and monopolistic,
caring nothing for other workers.
This form appeared among the
shoemakers of Massachusetss in
1648, organized mainly to control inferior
workmen. S im ilar organizations
in other industries were always
local and more or less temporary.
The birth of the modern trade
union movement m ay be assigned
to the closing years of the Eighteenth
century, though it never attained
the dignity of a movement
until the Nineteenth ccntury was
well under w’ay. Famous First
Facts gives 1792 as the date for
the first local craft union, that of
Philadelphia shoemakers. The labor
movement grew out of the industrial
revolution which brought
about a change in the manner and
means of production, and so caused
a wider separation between master
and journeyman. The Americana
states that trade unionism reached
the “ coming out” stage with the organization
of the Mechanics Union
of Trade Associations at Philadelphia
in 1827.
{ Modem trade unionism in Europe
began with the industrial revolution
in Great Britain during the Eighteenth
century.
The American Federation of
Labor in August, 1937, claimed a
membership of 3,271,726 and the
Committee for Industrial Organization
in September, 1937, estimated
a membership of 3,718,000 in 32
unions; we find no estimate of m em bership
in independent unions.
The oldest known sitdown strike
has been traced back to 1565, when
journeymen bakers in Lyons,
France, struck. The first American
sitdown strike is reported to be that
of 3,000 General Electric company
workers at Schenectady, N. Y., in
December, 1^06. More re ently it
was revived first in Akron, Ohio, in
1934.
Europe Uses Most Fertilizer
Consumption of fertilizer in the
United States is at the rate of fiva
pounds per acre per farm. Nations
of Europe rank far ahead of
this country in fertilizer use. Holland
uses 99 pounds of chemical
plant food per acre annually. Belgium
80 and Germany 67. Then
come Denmark with 40, Norway
with 29 and Sweden with *2 pounds
Prance uses 21 pounds per acrt,

spicuously enhance at the waistline.
Which reminds us that designers
are very enthusiastic in regard to
ornamental buttons, either large
and colorful like these, or veritable
jewel pieces in their settings of colored
stones.
If there is a school-faring maiden
who has not turned plaid-minded
this season during this epidemic of
plaids now sweeping through fashion
realms be it known that she is
certainly an exception to the rule.
When you see such eye-compelling
outfits as that shown above to the j
right in the illustration one readily
understands the reason why such a
fuss and furor is being made over
handsome wool plaids this fall. This 1
most attractive daytime frock fashioned
of fine Scottish clan wool plaid i
was selected for illustration from
among a flock of gorgeous plaids
displayed at a prevue showing of j
autumn and winter fashions presented
by the Style Creators of Chicago.
It is typical of schoolgirl choices
this season. *
Had you thought of a Roman
striped wool jacket to wear with
different skirts, of dark monotone
wool? The biggest argument we
can make in favor of such a selection
is the stunning style pictured
above to the left in the group. Here
is an example of the effective way
in which designers are working out
color alliances. Under this Roman
striped wool jacket this lady of high
fashion wears a chartreuse blouse
of silk crepe draped from a demure
neckline and rendered uneven at
the waistline by a black serpentine
belt. The plain skirt is of black
wool.

Porcelain Chains
Scoring Success
With pottery and china jewelry
scoring such success, it has been
only a short step to the use of porcelain
for their chains. Thin plastic
links rather than metal for necklaces
and bracelets are sometimes
opaque and sometimes transparent
and will not tarnish as some metals
do. They arc, of course, much lighter
than metal, and add the finishing
touch to the whole scheme
of lightweight jewelry.

R O O S E V E L T ’ S R O L E
(Letter to Capital Times.)
Madison, Oct. 6— For those of us
who are removed from the present war
scenes of the world it is not only our
responsibility but obligation to think
through, clearly and fairly, every controversial
incident as it arises, rather
than yield to emotion or prejudice.
In your criticism of Phil F. La Follette’s
radio address on the neutrality
bill you countered the point that if w«>
repealed the arms embargo we would
favor England, with the clever argument
that if we retained the arms embargo
we would favor Germany.
Surely if you had stated it fairly,
you would have reinforced Phil’s statement
by adding that we would not bt
taking this course for the sake of
England or the undoing of Germany
but for the sole purpose of preserving
our own neutrality.
Furthermore would it not be equally
plausible to say that if we retained the
arms embargo we would help neither
side but starve the war? Certainly
any one urging the repeal of the arm
embargo is doing so with the one hop
of helping England.
Weren’t you for Mr. Roosevelt in
1936 when he said in his Chautauqua
speech:
“It is clear that our present policy
and the measures passed by congres:
(essentially the present arms embarg
provision) would in the event of war
on some other continent reduce war
profits which would otherwise accrue
to American citizens. Industrial and
agricultural production for a war market
mry give immense fortunes to p
few men, for the nation as a whole it
produces disaster. It was the prospect
of war profits that made our farmers
in the west plow up prairie land tha*
should never have been plowed, bu*
should have been left for grazinir
cattle. Today we are reaping the harvest
of those war profits in the dust
storms which have devastated thns
war plowed areas.
I f we face the choice of profits or
peace, the nation will answer—must
answer— ‘we choose peace!’ It is the
duty of us to encourage such a body
of public opinion in this country that
the answer will be clear and, for aP
practical purposes, unanimous. . . ”
I f you supported Mr. Roosevelt ir
the above statements. Mr. Evjue, d
you not think it would be far better t
urge the president to follow the cours*
recommended to him by a prominent
English woman, in the following letter.
“I bog you not to let your country
join in the European war. I want the
United States to remain an area o^
wide sanity. . . .
“I do not want America, however, tf
stand aloof from Europe. I want you
to come in and make peace. You havt
tried again and again. I know. W«
are deeply grateful but please go on
Please do not stand on ceremony
Challenge us and our leaders, both
Hitler and Halifax, every wa*ek. Point
out how mad it is to destroy Europe
"Appeal to us one week for the sak
of the old architecture, the cathedral*:
the next for the sakt? of our forests
fields and gardens; the next for tht
sake of youth and old age. Appeal one
week to the scientists and business
men and the next to the philosopher
and parsons.
“ Lecture us. Make fun of us. Pul’
our leg. Talk plainly to us in the
name of God.
“ And please always make the sam*
specific offer that you’ll come and help
us if we stop fighting.
“ Please show us British up, how
very like Hitler we are in our race
pride in India and our broken promiae
in Palestine. And show Hitler up. how
like he is to us in his constantly assumed
air of conscious rectitude.
Show us that it is no worse to covet
empire than to cleave to empire. Ant1
that it’s time we put our imperial ter
ritorial possessions under supemation
al authority in which men of honor!
like Francis Sayre could act.
“Traveling over almost the whole of
your country, sometimes speaking f
and five times a day, I met many of
your opponents as well as your supporters.
Last night a rather brilliant
young educationalist said, ‘I believe)
Mr. Roosevelt could swing the nation
into or out of war. which ever he
choose! I quickly inquired, “ But d
you think he could pull Europe out of
the w a r?’ He thought a minute and
then said. ‘Yes.’ ’*
Don’t you think Mr. Roosevelt’s Peculiar
talents would be more effective

Millions of dollars ro up in smoke
each year as the result of unconflned
fires. An incinerator such as this
will insure safety in burning rubbish
and garbage. An adequate supply
of water should be at hand.
An accumulation of rubbish near
the furnace is always dangerous.
Ashes, falling from the shovel, can
easily ignite any debris. A pail of
sand or water near the furnace is
a necessary precaution.

WHAT IS ADVERTISING GENIUS?
Mrs. Lester Sickler entertained her
knitting club last Thursday night.
The Union Sewing Circle met at the
home of Mrs. Rudolph Hanson yesterday
afternoon.
Mrs. Carl Hanson celebrated her
birthday Monday afternoon by entertaining
friends at her home.
Mrs. Harry Gauerke entertained
friends Saturday afternoon, the occasion
being her birthday anniversary.
Rev. N. B. Ursin will conduct mission

forenoon and afternoon, at South New

Mr. and Mrs. Walter Hubert entertained
friends Wednesday nipht of
last week, the occasion being Mrs.
Hubert’s birthday.
Miss Evelyn Nousen was tendered a
shower at her home near Eland Saturday

Alfred Emmel has been announced.
Mrs. Albert Gunderson entertainedj
ber card club on Wednesday afternoon.
IN T HE early days of advertising
there were men who posed in the
role of genius. They shrouded advertising
with mystery. To portray
their part they let their hair grow,
wore flowing bow ties, affected a
far-away look and muttered mysterious
formulae.
Some persons still believe that the
ability to advertise a business successfully
is like the ability to write
poetry—an inborn gift.
It isn’t at all. The closer advertising
comes to answering some
of the needs in the lives of common,
ordinary people the more nearly it
comes to success.
The only genius needed in advertising
is the everyday genius of telling
the truth in a
simple and an understandable
way.
A few months ago
some of the leaders
in the advertising
profession w e r e
boasting about the
results of their work.
One of the advertising
publications published
what they
said about themselves.
Charles Roth
Writers of some of
the largest corporations in the country
took part in the discussion. But
a little druggist in Florida, spending
just a few dollars in his local
newspaper, was able to top all the
results of these high-salaried advertising
men.
All he did was to know the desires
of his customers, and sit down
and tell them what he had in a sim ple,
an understandable, a convincing,
conversational way. Here is his
advertisement:
SATURDAY SP E C IA L
this coupon and 5 cents
Will buy a Bigger and Better
“ Double D ip ”
IC E C R E AM SODA
Clip this Coupon and bring it with
five cents to the
P A R K V IEW D R I G STORE
This is a perfect advertisement. It
offers a wanted service. It offers
value. It inspires confidence. It is
something people in his neighborhood
wanted to read.
It d id n ’t take a genius to write it,
but the whole genius of advertising
is behind it.
Every day advertisers are publishing
sim ilar announcements in the
newspapers. These announcemerjs
are as much in what is called the
public interest as the results of scientific
research or study—because
they bring the public something it
wants to make life better or more
interesting or, in the case of Park
View Drug, a little more enjoyable.

W IS H ," mourned Sue Tressel,
* “ I had something to do. I wish
Arlene didn’t have the measles, or
that I ’d had them so I could go
over and play with her.”
“ I expect,” smiled Mother, “ that
Arlene wishes much the same thing.
She’s just sick enough to have to
stay in bed, and just well enough to
want something to do. Maybe you
could fix something for her to do.
j That would give you something to
do, too.”
••What?”
•‘Arlene’s mother has a little lapboard
that Arlene could use for pasting.
Of course, you wouldn’t want a
big scrapbook if you were sick,
; but—”
Sue’s face beamed. ‘‘I ’ll make a
little- scrapbook—of some of my
new notepaper,” she said delightedly.
“ Arlene can handle that.”
Mother punched the holes for her
and she tied the sheets together w’ith
ribbon. Then she had the happiest
kind of a time finding and cutting
out pretty pictures that w’ould fit.
When she had enough, Mother said
she could carry them over herself.
“ It will be all right to go to the
door.” So Sue trotted across the
street with the scrapbook m ate rial
and a bottle of paste.
“ Tomorrow we will think of something
else,” said Mother. The next
morning she laid out some m a g a zines,
all of them open at paper
dolls. “ W'hen you’re sick you like to
play with paper dolls,” she said to
Sue.
“ O, this is going to be a nice
thing to do,” was the smiling response.
She began to sing and sang
almost all the time she was cutting
out the dolls and putting each doll
and her wardrobe into a separate
envelope. Then Mother brought a
big envelope.
•‘When you’re sick it ’s nice to have
something to smile over. Can you
read what I have w ritten?” she
asked.
Sue read:
"These dolls cannot take the measles
from you, and
Dressing them all u i l l be something
to do .’*
After enclosing the little envelopes
she trotted across the street and
| left them at Arlene’s door.
The third morning was bright and
sunny. “ How about taking Arlene
a bit of outdoors?” suggested Moth-
| er. “ Do you know the names of the
leaves of all the trees in our yard?
See if you can think up a game for
Arlene.”
Help Children When Necessary.
After a time Sue came running in,
her eyes shining, “ Could I get some
pieces of paper and pin a different
leaf to each and let her write what
she thinks their names are under
I th em ? ”
Mother nodded. “ So that she need
I not think too hard, write the names
i for her on another sheet of paper,
but don’t arrange the leaves in the
same order. Tomorrow you can
give her some more leaves with the
I nam e of each written underneath,
and she can change the names or
the leaves on her sheets if any are
wrong.”
Soon Sue had samples of all the
; leaves in the yard and wras earnestly
at work preparing them for A rlene.
Mother had a large envelope
. ready, on which she had written:
"C u t out each mime a n d p in it tight.
Tomorrow you'll te e which names are
r ig h t ”
Sue’s mother was not only understanding.
but she was wise. She
knew childish energy demanded an
outlet. In this instance she m ade use
of two fundamental principles. She
gave Sue an objective: to help make
Arlene happy, and she led Sue to
think out what to do herself.
Much of what we call naughtiness
in children is lack of something to
do. Let us keep our thinking caps
handy and have, for ready use, a
mental list of possible activities. As
we use these, from time to time, let
us give the children help where
needed, but not to the extent of destroying
their own initiative.
And let us help them to help in
the things we do. I t ’s sometimes
tiresome to have them “ messing
around.” but that is the way they
learn. And we mustn’t forget to
appreciate the children’s efforts, no
I m atter how crude—ignore them, or
criticize too harshly, and we chill
their enthusiasm.

“ Ten Terrible Seconds”
He l l o , e v e r y b o d y :
This is a yarn about a couple of ropes. The yarn—well—
it’s told by Herman R. Wallin of Brooklyn, N. Y. Herman
is supposed to be the adventurer and principal character in it,
but somehow or other the ropes managed to take over the story.
One of those ropes chisels into this story solely on the strength
of the fact that it—well—that it just wasn’t. If we mentioned it
here, it’s only to post it as A. W. O. L. at a time when it was
needed'for guard duty. The other rope comes in at the crucial
point in our story. Like the hero of the old ten-twenty-thirty
melodrama it shows up in the nick of time to right the wrong the
other rope has done and prove to the world that though some
ropes may be low down and onery, there are good ropes as well
os bad.
And now that I ’ve told you the plot of today’s little drama,
let’s bring in Herman Wallin—and on with the show.
T o d a y , H e r m a n is a r a d io o p e r a t o r o n th e S. S. B ir k e n h
e a d , b u t th is a d v e n t u r e h a p p e n e d in J u l y , 1926, w h e n
H erm an was occupying the radio shack of the S. S. Cornelia plying between
New York and the West Indies. The Cornelia was almost at the
end of her "o u t” trip—just two or three hours run from the first of the
tropical island ports at which she was due to call.
Herman’s Radio Shack Located on After Part of Boat Deck.
It was a dark night, and Herman was on the lower deck,
m aking his way up to the boat deck where his room was located.
And—well—before we go any farther with this yarn we'll have to
tell you something about the way the S. S. Cornelia was constructed.
Suppose we let H erm an do that himself.
“ My radio shack,” Herman says, “ was on the after part of the boat
deck—the only quarters located on this part of the ship. A few feet
away from my room, on either side of the shack were davits for two
lifeboats which had been removed. Since the members of the crew
Wrench—What happened to Mr
Ax?
Screwdriver—Oh, he flew off the
handle again!
Chinese Shampoos
For many centuries before the
West intruded upon the East, Chinese
women used hair shampoo*, to
achieve the sleek glossiness that is
the principal pride of their coiffures.
Some of these shampoos were made
of crushed mulberry leaves, rose
and jasmine perfumed oils and "p ao
hua tzu'*—pine tree shavings—the
latter used for their resinous content
and balsamic odor.
fle went through an open space between the two boat davits— and walked
overboard.
seldom came up on this deck, and then in the daytime only, no ropes
had been stretched across the openings between the davits.”
And there you have not only the layout of H erm an’s sea-going penthouse
but also the lowdown on that rope that just wasn’t there.
That missing rope was quite a problem. You know they don't
have any open lights on the top deck of a ship because they
interfere with the vision of the officer on watch up on the bridge.
On nights when there wasn't any moon, Herman used to have to
watch his step pretty carefully. Usually he would start walking
from the ladder in a straight line, counting out the number of
ite p s it required to get to his door. But on this particular night
be paused half way in his course and looked back.
Lot's wife was turned into a pillar of salt for stopping and looking
back. H erm an just sort of lost his bearings, but that was almost as
bad. When he started out again he was going the wrong way in the
dark. He was still counting steps when, all of a sudden he went
through an open space between two boat davits—and walked overboard.
And Then Came the Ten Terrible Seconds.
And then came those ten terrible seconds—the worst moments
in Herman's life. It felt as if time had been slowed down like
one of those slow-motion movies— seemed as though that dive
from tbe top deck was taking a year. Herman can still count
over every one of those seconds—can still remember how the lights
of the lower deck went crawling past him as he fell. One of his
arm s grated the rail of the lower deck as he went by, and
through his m ind flashed the thought that that rail was the last
thing he could possibly have caught hold of.
Below h im now were only the smooth steel plates of the ship's side,
straight down to the water line. Herman thought of the propellor,
threshing the water at the ship’s stern and remembered hearing that
anyone falling overboard close to the side inevitably gets sucked into
the vortex of the churning water and chopped to mincemeat.
The water was coming up at him now. He could see it gleaming
dully beneath him and he braced himself for the shock of hitting it.
Then, suddenly, his left arm hit something—hit it with a sharp, stinging
blow that bent it double and almost took Herman's breath away.
Herman didn't know what it was, but instinctively he made a
grab for it. He caught it—and his hand skidded several yards
along a wet, slimy surface before he realized what it was. A
rope! A missing rope had gotten him into this spot in the first
place. Another one—a rope that was very m urh present—seemed
to be helping him out of it.
His Feet Were Dragging in the Water When He Stopped.
H erman clutched at that rope until he thought his arm would come
off. “ My feet were dragging in the water as I came to a stop,” he
says, “ and thc tug of the water added to the strain on m y hands. I
heard faint shouts above me. The engineroom telegraph rang and I
could feel the side of the ship shuddering as though it had hit some obstruction
in the water. Then I could see heads thrust out over the deck
rail and several voices were calling to me to hang on. A couple of men
sitting on the lower deck had seen me flash by and had shouted to the
officer on watch to stop the ship.”
A rope ladder came over the side and a deckhand came down
to help Herman back aboard. "When I reached the deck," he
says, " I was so weak with fright that I couldn't stand up. They
took me to a stateroom and put me in a bunk. Outside of a
few bruises and a pair of skinned hands, I was as good as ever in
a few hours, but 1 saw to it next day that a couple of lines
were stretched between those empty boat davits.”
And in case you're wondering what that other rope was doing hanging
over the side of the ship, here's Herman with the answer. “ It was
what is known as the guest line,” he says. “ It's a heavy rope put
over the side near the water's edge and used to tie small boats nnd
launches near the gang way. Thc ship was approaching the first of our
tropical ports and this line had been put out only a few hours before.”

Armed invasion, pirate plunder
and the West Indies setting in the
struggle for domination in the New
World, in which England, France
and Spain were the principal actors,
are found in the history of Nassau,
capital of the Bahamas.
Today Nassau is typical of the
self-governing British colony. Here
are found the clean streets, smart
colonial police garbed in their summer
khaki shorts, and the tennis
courts where the English love to
mingle social tea with their sports
The Twentieth century has
brought a different kind of invasion
to Nassau. Summer and winter
vacationists, refreshed by the
breezes blowing inland from the
West Indies sea, have brought
changes to this British colony. Golf
clubs which have taken the places
of useless forts, swimming pools
which have been substituted for
pirate hideouts, racing yachts which
now rule Bahamian waters and Nassau's
coral beaches are the loot
sought by Twentieth century invaders
who desire leisure sports and
escape from offices and headlines.

the laboratory which will some day
transform a tragically afflicted
world, he devised the system h im self
and superintended its installation.
It turned heavy, sluggish air
into cool mountain breezes, and gave
h im new energy for his continuing
scientific work, at the age of 70.
Perhaps the falling leaves give
poignancy and sadness to the fate
of this kindly old gentleman, driven
from his country in the up-thrust of
the new—or possibly the old—savagery
of Europe.
One might write off Josef
Beck and Marshal Edward
Sm ig ly R y d z, political and m ilitary
careerists, also exiled, as
incidental casualties, caught in
the backwash of their own am bitions.
President Moscicki, although
merely a symbol in
feudal Poland, may find a place
in the later balance brought forward.
If there is to be a new
d ark age, it may be that laboratories
will be the monasteries
which will be the havens
of the humane spirit and the
aspiring intelligence, as were
the monastic refuges of the
Middle ages.
He is one of the greatest electrochemists
in Europe, ranked with the
great Germ an, Haber. In the field
of synthetic chemistry, he holds
about 300 patents. He was a college
professor for m any years, tall and
thin with white hair and a spiked
moustache, as convinced as was
Woodrow Wilson that a “ new freedom
” could be gained by the mobilization
of planetary intelligence
and good will. Much in the manner
of our own distinguished Dr. Robert
Ar.drews M illikan, he acclaimed the
ultim ate trium p h of science over
hate and stupidity. To date, the
good genii which they have sum moned
are enslaved by men of
lesser understanding.

speech and action.
As the
keynoter for
t h e i n t e r -
American conference of foreign
ministers at P anam a, he sharply assails
totalitarianism and religious
and racial persecution and invokes
unity of the American republics in
the spirit of constructive isolation
fo r which our state department is
proselyting just now.
Dr. Arosemena, a realistic
veteran of P anam anian politics,
has, in the past, accepted our
“ good neighbor” policy on
grounds of enlightened selfinterest.
He has been keenly
aware that the Canal Zone
m igh t be a m ajo r trouble spot,
if war comes this way, and, recently,
discussing its defense, he
said, “ If they start shooting up
the canal, they'll be shooting at
us, too, and that’s why we want
to help defend it.”
He was foreign minister of P a n am
a from 1929 to 1936, elected president
in the latter year, and in years
past has been sharply opposed to
the United States on various issues.
In the presidency, he has inclined
m uch more in our direction. He is
friendly and genial, rather in the cut
of an enterprising business man. In
the 1938 L im a convention, he joined
the Brazilian delegation in accepting
the Roosevelt overtures for
friendship and unity.

accurate measurements, deft handling,
and the proper temperature
for baking are the factors of success.
If you’ve had difficulty with quick
breads that are coarse texturcd and
full of the long holes called “ tunnels”
in all probability you’ve been
over-conscientious in mixing. Unless
otherwise specified, mix lightly and
only enough to blend the ingredients.
When you’re making baking powder
biscuits, remember that a little
kneading goes a long way toward
making biscuits flaky and light.
A simple recipe for baking powder
biscuit is the starting point for
a variety of tempting breads. Make
“ Pinwheels” by rolling out biscuit
dough to *,4 -inch thickness, brushing
with melted butter, and spreading
generously with grated cheese, devilled
ham , or thick jam . Roll up
the dough as for jelly-roll, cut in
1 slices, and bake in a hot oven (425

A young matron found herself
somewhat hustled by the number
and variety of her engagements.
One day in particular she found
troublesome, for she had to go
first to a funeral service and
then to a garden party.
She solved the dress problem by
wearing smart but sober clothes
and taking in a hat box a flowered
hat which, during the service,
she placed in the vestry.
Her sense of quiet pleasure at
this successful solution of the
problem was somewhat marred,
however, when the coffin was
brought into church. For reposing
in the canter of the wreaths

D E F O K E a due! with swords the
U* gladiators of ancient Home were
accustomed to drink together. Wine
was furnished by a relative or a
friend of one of them and to show
that there was no poison in the
glass of his opponent, the challenger
poured his wine into the other's
glass and back again until the contents
of both glasses were thoroughly
mixed. That custom extended to
social usage and finally as the days
of poisoned wine became past history,
it evolved merely to the clinking
of glasses.
