Friday May 19 1939 marks the
centennial of the first survey within
the confines o f what is now Jackson
County Wisconsin 
On a Sunday one century previous 
Joshua Hathaway a deputy United
States surveyor accompanied by W illiam
G Barker and J S Barker as
chainmen and Anthony D Wisner as
marker entered the county running
the fourth principal meridian between
the towns o f Knapp and Bear B lu ff
covering two miles of the line that
day The close o f the next day found
them at the northwest corner of Town
20 Range 1 East where they turned
and ran eastward along the second
correction line and in two days were
outside the boundaries o f our county 
No more surveying was done within
the confines o f our county until
1845 in Melrose and North Bend
country by James D Turner 
Hathaway was b om in Rome New
York in the same year as Lincoln
was 30 years old at this time and until
his death in 1863 lived in and
was a highly respected citizen of Milwaukee
where he held several official
positions and dealt in real estate 
The historian writing of this survey
says they were tormented with mosquitoes 
gnats flies and other insects
in great swarms and probably as the
result in their experience with insects
no more surveying was done
here in the summer time the balance
of the county being surveyed in late
fall and in the winter time 
A t the time o f Hathaway s survey 
and fo r a dozen years later this was
part of Crawford county with Prairie
du Chein as the county seat Hathaway s
appearance though temporary 
antedates Spaulding Woods arrival
here by about three months and was
the first happening in the county a fter
the Indian treaty of 1837 in which
they ceded their lands to the government 
Miss Joyce Roberts and Douglas
Lambert teachers in Jo in t 4 Knapp

They left about 6 30 a m 
and were home by 8 p m They
drove around the square and out to
Vilas Park where they had a picnic
dinner and saw the sights o f the zoo 
They went through the capitol under
the direction of a guide and their
bus stopped in front of the 10 cent
store where each youngster bought
himself a souvenir ranging from real
gold rings to new fishlines with
money given them by their teachers 
They stopped at Devils Lake on their
way home where Mr Hardie gave
them a treat o f ice cream I t was
a day o f days for 22 young people 
most o f whom had never before been
to Madison

In spite of the busy days at home
twenty eight farmers from the Upper
Pigeon Creek Soil Conservation District
found time to take part in an
all day tour on Tuesday May 16th 
The tour was planned to give the farmers
an opportunity to observe conservation
practices at the La Crosse
experimental farm and the Coon Valley
soil erosion Camp area 
The group met at the experimental
farm at 10 00 a m where they were
conducted over the different plots by
those in charge of the station Considerable
work has been done with
check plots to record the soil and
water run o ff from different crop
plots This work was very interesting
since it shows just what takes place
on the different fields when planted
t o corn and grain as compared with
hay and grass crops 
During the afternoon the group visited
two farms in the Coon Valley
camp area to observe the terracing
work which was completed on these
farms three years ago Terracing or
strip cropping practices are being carried
out on all fields on these farms 
On some of the fields a combination
of terracing and strip cropping practices
are being used The owners of
these farms were glad to discuss the
erosion prevention practices with the
group and answer any questions 
The group was greatly impressed
by the fact that a high percentage of
the farmers in the area around La
Crosse Coon Valley and Westby are
using strip cropping practices on their
farms Many farmers in this area have
used strip cropping practices for many
years 
On Tuesday May 23rd this
group of farmers and others in the
Upper Pigeon Creek Soil Conservation
District will hold a program planning
meeting at the York community

Bright red poppies bloomed out today
at Auxiliary Headquarters when
the American Legion Auxiliaries received
their supply of the World War
memorial flowers for Poppy Day Saturday 
May 27th The poppies hundreds
of carefully made replicas of
the famous poppies of France and
Belgium came from Milvvaukee 
where they were made by disabled
war veterans 
The Auxiliary Poppy committees 
under the direction of their chairmen
are putting in busy hours counting
and arranging the flowers in readiness
for the women who will offer
them on the streets on Poppy Day to
be worn in honor of the World W ar
dead Preparations are being made
to cover the entire county with the
flowers with the hope that every one
will join in the observance of the
day and pay tribute to those who
gave their lives in defense of democracy 
 Each poppy has been shaped with
painstaking care by some disabled
veteran Each one is slightly different
from the others because they
are made entirely by hand Some are
more perfect than others due to the
varying skill of the veterans but all
represent the best efforts of their
makers to reproduce in crepe paper
the wild Flanders poppy which grew
and bloomed along the battle front
in France and Belgium 
 The idea of the poppy as the memorial
flower for the war dead
sprang naturally to the minds o f the
men in France when they saw these
brave little flowers blooming on the
bare battle graves Colonel John
McCrea expressed it in his immortal
poem and one o f the first acts of
The American Legion was the adoption
of the poppy as its memorial
flower The British Legion also
adopted the poppy and the flower is
worn in every part of the world to
commemorate the sacrifice o f those
who fell in the ranks o f the democratic
powers

The major portion of the past week
was devoted to consideration of the
budget 
Three substitutes and about 30
amendments were considered All attempts
by the Progressives and Democrats
to restore school aids aids for
teachers training colleges and U niversity
aids were defeated However 
the final substitute as adopted by the
assembly increases the educational
aids considerable over that originally
allotted in the governor s budget 
Attempts to increase the allotments
for old age pensions were also defeated 
As finally agreed upon the bill
was messaged to the senate where it
will be considered this week while the
assembly is expecting to receive from
the finance committee a tax bill to
raise the necessary funds It is very
probable that the Progressives and
Democrats will also prepare substitute
tax bills and then the battle will
be on as to how the necessary funds
will be raised So far the Republican
dominated finance committee has
given no indications as to howr they
propose to raise the necessary funds 
and the public is anxiously awaiting
the possibility o f a sales tax or a luxury
tax 
The Power and Light companies
are insisting on equality o f tax rates
with Rural Electric companies while
the R E A s insist that they are required
to serve communities that have
been refused services by the private
power companies and should receive
a lower tax rate 
An absolute repeal o f teachers tenure
passed the assembly and was messaged
to the senate but rumors would
indicate that the senate expects to
substitute herefor a modified repeal
bill and in that case it must be returned
to the assembly for senate approval 
The bill which would prohibit the
state from giving state insurance to
public building in counties towns and
school districts was finally killed and
the bill to allow county clerks to issue
auto licenses was passed in the
assembly but must pass one further
test on reconsideration 
After passage of the tax bill to
meet the requirements of the budget
and the raising of funds for poor relief
the legislature will consider resolutions
relative to determining a
date for sine dine adjournment which
will probably be some time in June

Mrs Rainey wants to know if the
city has made any provision for destitute
people hunting work and no one
wants them The citizens feed many
during the year for they will not
turn them away hungry What can
we do The last I fed on Mother s
Day 
I answered a rap at the kitchen door 
A stranger was standing there 
Weary from tramping young and
passing fair 
He looked at me a moment
And this is what he said 
 Lady I am hungry will you give
me some bread 
Give him yes and plenty 
I could not turn him away
For he was some mother s boy

Saturday May 6th was a big day
in La Crosse Not only was it the
day o f the solo and ensemble contest 
in which Black River was well represented 
but it was the day in which
the Norwegian Crown Prince Olav
and Crown Princess Martha visited
the city 
A number of B R Falls students
were fortunate in being able to see
the royal couple who are on an extensive
tour o f the United States The
guests were entertained at the lovely
home of Mrs A dolf Gunderson which
was only about a block and a h a lf
from the church where the Black
River students ate their lunch It
was here that most of the students
got their first glimpse o f royalty 
some when the couple entered the
home others as the couple left about
an hour later to join the parade in
their honor 
 What did they look like is the
question asked by every one who was
not there Well they look no different
than any ordinary person Just
like the simple unpretentious people
you d meet on the street any day 
Both Prince Olav and Princess Martha
have pleasing personalities They
waved and bowed to the crowds as
they wound their way through They
were friendly and cordial and smiling
at all times enjoying the tribute being
paid to them by La Crosse Several
of the B R Falls band members
watched the parade from down town 
As the car containing the royalty
passed them Prince Olav noticing
their uniforms waved a greeting to
them Needless to say our home boys
were well pleased 
 What did they wear is the other
question every one asks The answer
that they looked like ordinary people
fits here too Prince Olav wore a
plain business suit and soft felt hat
which he continually doffed to the
crowd Princess Martha wore a tailored
suit and carried an arm ful o f
beautiful red roses which had been
presented to her 
In stature Prince Olav was tall and
very sturdy He was a handsome man
with ruddy complexion and saqdy colored
hair Princess Martha was tall
and slim with dark hair Contrary to
most beliefs the prince is not o f Norwegian
blood He is Danish and
English a cousin to King George of
England His father King Haaken 
was a Danish prince whom the Norwegians
elected to be their King The
Princess is Swedish and Danish 
Prince Olav does most of the talking
for he and his wife and speaks excellent
English with a slight trace of
an English accent as he was educated
in England 
These are some o f the impressions
the B R Falls students got after
viewing the future King and Queen
o f Norway So May 6th was a big
day in two wrays for them They won
honors in music and got their first
glimpse of a real prince and princess 
M U S IC N O T E S
Well students you should congratulate
every student who competed at
the solo tournament May 6 I am
sure we can be prouu o f them as they
all did well 
Twenty one schools attended this
contest and it was a big day for all
of them 
Black River Falls received 21 firsts 
30 seconds and two thirds They can
be justly proud as they received more
firsts than any other school entered 
The students are to be congratulati
ed on their fine work and we hope
the band orchestra and glee club do
as well on May 20

The Seniors seem to be the people
to think of the funny things even if
they have had a four year seige of
High school On Friday May 12th 
some o f the Seniors presented a play 
 Graduation at Gooseville 
All members o f the cast were
dressed in funn y costumes Most of
them wore pajamas Marion Thompson 
whose singing teacher was Mary
Perry sang a solo The orchestra
consisted o f a group of girls dressed
in pajamas and playing instruments
which they had never used before 
They also sang songs which referred
to the Gooseville graduating class 
Arland Thompson and Bob Amo 
whose dancing teacher was Vivian
Anderson gave us a dance called the
 Pony s Gallup and Spring Has
Sprung 
Some o f the graduates gave speeches
and read poems while they chewed
gum to their little hearts content 
They were all bashful and would run
to their places as soon as they had
finished 
A fter their speeches were finished
two of the trustees placed the bushel
basket o f diplomas on a stand and
told the graduates to Come and Get
I t and that they did A fter receiving
their diplomas they sang their
closing song which was the tune to
 My Bonnie 
The play proved to be good entertainment
for the audience as you
could tell by the laughter and applause

Saturday is the big day for Black
River Falls High school when its
band orchestra and girls glee club go
to La Crosse State Teachers College
to carry the black and orange into
the realms of musical competition 
About 28 bands and three orchestras
will compete in the annual affair
striving for first places in their respective
classes The climax o f the
event is the parade of the bands in
the afternoon through downtown La
Crosse 
Two added features make the 1939
tournament an important event for
Black River High One is the use of
the new Glackenspiel which the band
acquired this year The bell like instrument
is very unique and adds
much color to the band on the march 
Clear tones can be heard above the
band and with its gay orange plumes
it is no doubt that this unusual instrument
will attract much attention 
The second feature is that for the
first time in its musical history Black
River High is entering a glee club in
the contest so the girls glee club has
the honor of being B R Falls first
vocal group to compete in a tournament 
Judging from the concert it is
certain they too will make a fine
showing for our high school as our
ban dand orchestra have always done 
We d like to wish the band orchestra
and glee club the best of luck for
tomorrow We feel certain that they
will do their best and bring as in the
past more honors to our high school

Twenty cars transported music students
from Black River Falls to La
Crosse State Teachers College for the
annual spring solo and ensemble tournament 
Saturday May 6th 
The singing and playing began at
8 o clock and continued until 12 30 
but was resumed again at one o clock
and went steadily on until 6 00 
All students and drivers were given
an entrance ticket wrhich was to be
saved for May 20 Mr Johnson took
the students to the English Lutheran
church about five blocks from the
normal for lunch 
We fear some fared badly that
night after all the ice cream cones 
cokes and hot dogs they had consumed
during the way 
Black River Falls was fortunate
this year in having its Home Room
on the first floor 
The crown prince and princess of
Norway were at La Crosse and between
the playing and singing every
one tried to catch a glimpse o f them 
A ll in all it was a busy day and
thanks to Miss Keefe and Mr Jo rgensen 
Black River Falls students
brought home many honors they
should be proud of 
F A R E W E L L S E N IO R S !
The Seniors are going to graduate
and that means their last few weeks
in the Black River Falls High school 
Here s wishing them loads o f success
and happiness for everything they undertake
to do 
I suppose some will be going to
colleges and universities o f all descriptions 
O f course some will go
home and take over the farm and
progress rapidly But I ll bet they
learned that at school For we know
that Mr Jorgenson taught them Geography
where they learned good soil
contains 60 per cent sand and 40 per
cent clay And what crops could
grow there O f course they took Biology
under Miss Wagner where they
learned to distinguish different plants
and animals Some took Manual
Training under Mr Arnold where
they learned to build everything from
A to Z O f course they took bookkeeping
under Mrs Sindelar because
no one can farm unless they know
how to keep books how to save and
spend 
So we bid you farewell seniors 
and wish you luck 
It s first in sa le s just as it s first in acceleration
 first in hill climbing first in all round v a lu e!
O f course It s the sales leader! O f
course over h a lf a m illio n 1939
Chevrolets have been sold and the
demand is steadily Increasing! 
Because people everywhere definitely
know that Chevrolet Is the

 the value leader among all cars in
its price range!

The president o f Nicaraugua was
greatly pleased with the lavish military
display made upon his recent arrival
in Washington Never before
had a foreign potentate met with such
a reception upon his visit here not
even Prince Henry o f Germany or
the Prince o f Wales years ago 
Troops lined the streets and avenues
from the Union Station to the White
House nearly two miles and the capitol
plaza was likewise guarded The
Marine band sailors and marines and
forty army tanks escorted the procession 
The departments were closed a
couple o f hours and thousands of government
employees lined the walks 
Ropes along the streets over which
the parade occurred stopped all cross
traffic including cars trucks taxicabs 
and pedestrians That procedure
caused an outcry as thousands of vehicles 
many from out o f town could
not cross from one part of town to
another In all the elaborate arrangements 
no plans had been made to
put up detour signs which might have
avoided some of the confusion and
congestion But it is said that it was
a grand show to impress our Central
American good neighbors with the
weight and might o f our great land 
The Nicarauguan chieftain addressed
both houses o f Congress in
which he voiced his gratitude and at
the same time evidenced that his visit
had a business as well as social side 
Among other things he wants for
his country the building o f an oceanic
canal funds for an international
highway to South America and a
part o f the loan of $250 000 000
which it is proposed to make to Central
American and South American
countries to aid development and im prove
business Incidentally during
his visit he expressed a desire that
our government should assist in the
development of agriculture in his
country particularly dairying E vidently
the cockles o f his heart were
warmed to a high temperature by the
display of our greatness military
and otherwise 
The King and Queen o f England
are coming here next month and
what will happen then will make the
reception of the president o f Nicaraugua
seem like a side show of a
circus Ten thousand troops more
bands and probably still greater
crowds will greet them as they arrive
at the railway station which
will be surrounded by soldiers police
and hundreds of detectives and are
met by our dignitaries The King
and Queen will be guests at the
White House and probably will make
no speeches Social Washington particularly
society leaders are lending
great energy and political pull to be
included in the limited number o f
guests who will be permitted to attend
some o f the social functions at
which the royal visitors will mingle
with only top notchers Washington
people will be joined by thousands of
visitors from all parts o f the country
desiring to have a glimpse at the first
royal couple which has come to our
national capitol 
The naval appropriation bill passed
the House by a vote o f 296 to 58 
For the first time in years there was
an opportunity for a roll call on such
a measure due to the fact that only
140 members were on the floor making
possible a quorum call on the bill 
It is the largest navy bill which has
passed Congress since the days o f the
World war and carries $773 000 000 
or about $162 000 000 more than the
big amount voted a year ago W ith
funds from previous appropriations 
over one billion dollars will be available
for naval purposes the coming
year With W ar department funds
added the total for national defense
in 1940 will come close to the twobillion
dollar mark will top the
amount asked fo r relief and be nearly
twice as large as the funds for the
farm program as passed by the Senate 
Each such naval appropriation bill
in a way starts a new expansion o f
our war fleet For new construction 
this measure provides $254 204 712 
but less than $11 000 000 will be used
in 1940 for that purpose The remainder
will be expended upon new
ships on which work has already been
started A t future sessions further
appropriations will be made Except
for the smaller craft such as destroyers
and submarines the additions provided
now will not be completed in
less than six years possibly not in
less than eight or nine years It is not
the present crisis in Europe which
figures so largely in naval plans What
may happen in the next six or eight
years cannot be foreseen but our
country is preparing for whatever
does happen 
Included in this particular bill are
two more battleships Only four years
ago the largest battleships cost $35 
000 000 These two are to cost $186 
000 000 or $93 000 00 for each Cruisers
which formerly cost from eight
to ten millions now cost nearly double 
The cost of smaller war craft has
advanced in similar ratio Nor is the
limit near on naval expenditures The
building program will become larger
each year unless Congress calls a
halt 
Next year the plan will call for
$100 000 000 more By 1946 more
than one and one fourth billions will
have been expended on the new fleet
now building and which will not be
complete before then I f the same
policy is to be further expanded by
the end o f that time we shall be
obliged to commence the re building
and re construction part o f the program 
as war ships soon are worn out
and out moded In a decade naval
costs probably will be greater than
any other branch of government In
the past five years we have spent over

annual pay o f officers and men munitions
and supplies runs into more
millions By the time the battleship
becomes obsolete and is sold for scrap
iron or sunk in the seas as a target 
its total cost and expense runs well
over $400 000 000 With 10 such ships

craft on the way a slight estimate
may be made o f what naval supremacy
is going to cost in dollars At

Economy and budget balancing

for it and only 58 against The vote
against came largely from the middle

Frail hands that once were firm on
rifle stock 
Once strong and sure for any task to
block
The enemy o f peace and end all war 
Now fashion a red poppy and will
lock
W ith in its petals dreams of those
days when
The world moved to the beat of
marching men 
The priceless secret that each poppy
holds 
Made strong these willing hands
would serve again 
Poppy day will be observed thruout
the United States on Saturday 
May 27 with the wearing of memorial
poppies in honor o f the World War

 And as we prayed the fashion of
his countenance was altered (Luke
9 28) How little we realize that
prayer can have such a physical reaction 
Jesus referred to His house
as The House of Prayer the place
where worries cares o f life and troubles
may be replaced by the peace
and rest o f God Come just as you
are and meet with God

Sale Going Big At
Mattes Liverstock
Market
The Spring sales have been the
largest since the market opened The
last April sale having 140 horses 125
cattle and 225 pigs and everything
was sold the most o f the horses going
to southern and eastern Wisconsin
and northern Michigan and the cattle
to southern Wisconsin Illinois Iowa
and Indiana and the most o f the pigs
went to Minnesota and Iowa 
The Farmers within a reasonable
distance of the market are finding it
to be the best place to market their
cattle and young pigs for there are
always plenty o f buyers there to give
them the top price for them These
buyers will pay more for stock where
they can buy them by the load all
tested and ready to go than if they
have to drive through the country for
them 
The new 70x110 addition to the
sale b am is now complete and there
is capacity for 500 head of horses and
cattle So if you have anything to sell
give this market a trial 
Mr Mattes predicts the next sale 
Wednesday May the 31st to be a
large one and will have outside buyers
there to take care of a large run 
The gelling commission charged is
10 per cent which is no more than
any farmer having an auction pays to
sell his sale 
One fourth down is all the cash required
from the buyers 
These sales are cried by Wm 
Krause clerked by The Thorp F inance
Corporation and managed by
Harold Mattes and will run the year
around every other Wednesday rain
or shine *

 Treasure Island 
The old sea dog came down the lane 
That led to Hawkin s in n 
And standing in the doorway 
Was a lad whose name was Jim 
He was a very plain man 
He lived on bacon eggs and rum 
An deven i f they didn t have enough
He made them get him some 
One day when Jim was watching him 
There came a blind man to the door 
He handled Billy Bones a note 
That made hi mdrop face to the floor 
They bought a ship and got a cook 
Long John Silver was his name 
He pretended he was nice 
But he was crooked just the same 
As soon as they reached the Island 
Their adventure had begun 
When they went to find the treasure 
The pirates then began to run 
They weer very disappointed 
When they foun it wasn t there 
They only found a piece of silver 
The treasure wasn t anywhere 
To s ave J im s life 
Ben Gunn shouted in the air 
He kept the Trasure in the cave 
And they all got their share

Ice formed on water in pails left
outside last week for three nights
running and any one going out in the
early hours of the morning would
have seen the ground white with
frost It had tho very little effect on
the blueberry blossoms and also the
blossoms on apples trees and this was
because there was a breeze during the
night I f it had been a quiet night
Boy oh Boy! what damage it would
have done to the fru it crop 
The clerk was asking the usual
questions of the applicant applying

answer was given Next the clerk asked

a little too personal 
Last Sunday was a day long to be
remembered and there was a big
crowd there to celebrate the 6th anniversary
o f the founding o f the
Indian Mission Many whites were
there Some visitors and some guests
and others board members o f the
church sponsoring the missionary
work among the Winnebagoes The
atmosphere took on the air o f an oldtime
revival meeting and the sermon
and services were held under a large
canvas top erected on the mission
grounds The first five Winnebagoes
to be converted into Christianity
about 45 years ago were all present
at this 60th anniversary They were
Rev and Mrs John Stacy Rev David
W Decorah and two brothers the E lders 
George Lowe and King of Thunder 
By the way Mrs John Stacy
is a sister of the two brothers mentioned 
At this anniversary 17 young
Winnebago children were baptized
and became members of the congregation
o f the Mission church Dinner
was served to all who were present
and every one was again invited
for supper so no one went away hungry 
All credit must go to the Ladies
Aid of the Indian Mission for
all delectable eatables that were enjoyed
by all 
One can frequently listen to sermons
given by those who are well
read and well versed in the Bible
stories but it is a rare treat to hear
those who are really God inspired 
men who have Lived a lifetime really
trying to know God men who have
really tried to understand what God
expects o f any one apostle and these
were the type o f men and women who
were guest speakers at this grand
meeting The peace that passeth all
understanding seemed to have permeated
the very atmosphere and that
very peace and calm seemed to be reflected
in the face o f every one present 
The people o f the white race and
the Red race stood elbow to elbow 
shoulder to shoulder all happily worshipping
God who is really the only
one God of all races 
Weather permitting there will be a
ball game between the Komensky

Benediction Rev Schroeder
The senior class of 1939 has made
a record that is going to be hard for
future seniors to attain Eight of
the 21 seniors have class averages o f
90 or over for the four years in high
school This may seem high but
when compared with the records
made by the seniors in the state testing
program it is not surprising Two
boys received a percentile ranking of
100 This means that no senior in
the state received a higher mark than
they in the state test given One boy
received a percentile ranking of 99 
This means that only one per cent of
the students regardless of the size of
the school or town received a higher
mark than he did One girl received
a ranking o f 97 nine in the class received
a ranking o f 80 or above 
What does this mean This means
that nine students out of the senior
class of the Hixton High school could
and should be urged to attend the
University of Wisconsin The University
predicts that if these people
would attend that they would be successful
in their studies 
On Friday the Senior class will
leave early for the annual senior class
trip This year the seniors have chartered 
the bus and will drive to Waupun
where they will be conducted
through the state penitentiary Stops
will be made along the way down at
Wisconsin Dells and Poynette where
they will visit scenic beauty spots
and a radio broadcasting station

The average age of apples trees
in Wisconsin is generally estimated
at 40 years altho in some areas and
on some soils it is as low as 15 years 
It is believed that with care these orchards
can last for a much longer
period 
A new object of interest a glimpse
through the window this morning revealed
a robin sitting on her nest just
constructed in the crotch of a tree
on Loomis street But what a dumb
robin! The nest is exposed to every
marauder and the tree is traversed
frequently by the neighborhood squirrels 
But why should man living in
a world in which no better way has
been found to settle human differences
than for man to kill man criticise
the robin
