Republican Reorganization
Republican reorganization o f state
government continues on its w ay in
the state legislative halls. Five
months ago the senate repealed all of
the La Follette reorganization measures,
and Republicans then promised
a reorganization program o f their
own. While they have reenacted a
fe w o f the minor governmental
changes that were included in the P rogressive
program, they have offered
bills which call fo r sweeping governmental
changes o f such proportions
that the form er governor’s program is
dwarfed in comparison.
A lready passed and signed by the
Governor are the laws recreating the
state board o f agriculture, a new securities
division, a new labor board,
and a research bureau. Appointments
to the labor board, Henry C. Fuldncr,
Milwaukee, president o f the Fuldner
Construction company; Lawrence F.
Gooding, Fond du Lac attorney; and
R. Floyd Green, La Crosse, present
commissioner on the public service
commissio n, were named last week.
Appointees to the other new departments
are expected this week.
Still awaiting legislative action are
the follow in g measures: Consolidation
o f Wisconsin’s entire educational
system under a single board o f education;
reorganization o f the public service
commission, the tax commission,
and a public w elfare department combining
the activities o f the present
w elfare department and the state
board o f control; creation o f a motor
vehicles division; creation o f a W isconsin
Promotion Board, centralizing
the advertising and promotional activities
of the state now carried on by
the conservation commission and the
department o f agriculture and markets,
and including a new division of
promotion fo r industry and business.
Reorganization Hearings
Three o f the governmental depart-1
ment revision bills, the Wisconsin Promotion
board, the motor vehicle division,
and the single education board,
w ere considered by legislators and interested
parties at public hearings
last week.
A ll of them met opposition from
parties who would be affected by th°
changes. Secretary o f State Fred R.
Zimmerman, while not registering for
or against the motor vehicle division
bill, voiced stern disapproval and suggested
that rather than create a new
department, the function should be
placed with departments already created
ami operating. Secretary Zimmerman
thought it was “ a had bill and
a step in the wrong direction.” The
motor vehicle licensing division is now
under his supervision.
Assemblyman Schlabach, author of
the measure, told the committee that
his bill would save the state $300,000
annually by consolidating all the state
agencies now dealing with motor
vehicle traffic into a single division.
The bill to consolidate all state educational
boards under a single state
board o f education was opposed by
form er U niversity Regent Daniel
Grady, Edward J. Dempsey, president
o f the normal school board o f regents,
representatives o f vocational schools
and other educational administrative
boards.
Both Grady and Dempsey feared
possible bureaucratic control of educational
functions and asked that the
university be fre e of any bureau control
in the state capitol. John Callahan,
state superintendent o f schools
favored the measure and reported that
he had supported similar proposals
since 1013.
The bill to set up a state promotion
bureau and combine conservation and
department o f agriculture and markets
advertising was opposed by Ralph
Ammon, director o f the department of
markets. Ammon declared that such a
move would not be in the best interests
of agriculture. He told the committee
that agricultural advertising
to be successful must be hand in hand
with production, m arketing and grading.
Ammon’s statements w ere reiterated
by six or seven others, all
representatives o f agricultural organizations.
Auto License Bills
Three bills affecting auto licenses
have received favorable action by the
assembly.
A bili which would transfer licensing
power to the county clerks, killed
previously by a tie vote, was reconsidered,
and finally passed a substantial
vote margin. I f the bill becomes law
the 71 county clerks throughout the
state would issue licenses instead o f
the secretary o f state, and would keep
,S0 cents out o f each fee fo r adminis-
Building: Notes
A brand new front of ornamental
brick and glass, replacing the concrete
block front, is what Chester Bloecher
is making arrangements fo r a t his
garage on Grand avenue near the intersection
o f Highw ays 29 and 45. He
plans on cutting away four fe et from
the fron t end o f the building, which
w ill shorten the building to that extent.
The present canopy w ill be removed.
Mr. Bloecher has just completed
alterations in his office quarters, enla
rgin g these by the addition o f the
room hitherto used for storing automobile
parts. These he now has in a
good-sized room that he has created
in the attic space above the office,
made possible by lowering the ceiling
o f the office part.
The eaves o f the main building o f
the Y aeger Service Station are being
shortened, the aim being to provide
more clearance for the trucks under
the canopy.
Th^ construction o f the new water
tower at the Kraft-Phenix plant is
now completed and will be ready for
use as soon as all the joints o f the
floor and circular wall have been made
water tight.

OF L A N D B A N K F A R M S
A t a special conference o f the
Boards o f Directors o f the five N a tional
Farm Loan Associations serving
Lincoln, Langlade and Shawano eount
:es, held in A ntigo and Shawano on
May 16th, 1939, with representatives
from the Federal Land Bank of St.
Paul, plans were developed for a
special -ale o f all farms owned by the
Federal Land Bank in these counties.
Those in attendance af the conference
who helped develop the plan were
(1 ) Representing the Merrill National
Farm I^>an Association: Ernest L.
Krahn, vice-president; W alter Stockin
g and William Dotter, directors.
(2 ) Representing the A ntigo Farm
Loan Association: Jack A lft, president;
Arnold Schmege, Otto Gresch,
Wenzel Hallada, Elmer Tibbets, directors,
and Group Treasurer, H. W. Geilfuss,
of the Rhinelander office, which
will be moved to A ntigo on June 1.
(3 ) Representing the Hutchins N ational
Farm Loan Association: C. M.
Shelley, Mattoon, president; Nels Jansen,
A ntigo, vice-president; W alter
Kamps, A ntigo, Phillip Krumbach.
and W. J. Mortenson, Birnamwood,
directors.
(4 ) Representing the W ittenberg
National Farm Loan Association: Gust
Norrbom, Elderon, president; Arthur
Grimstad, W ittenberg, vice-president;
Otto Gunderson, Elderon, L. H. Brehmer,
Eland, R. 1, and Christ Slotten,
Wittenberg, directors.
(5 ) Representing the Shawano
County National Farm Loan Association:
Hugh Lutsey, Pulaski, president;
Albert Hall, Underhill, vice-president;
Otto Nicholaus, Shawano, Anton A n derson,
Pulaski, directors, and Group
Seen tary-Treasurer, Dean K. Van
Doren, o f the Shawano office.
The Federal Land Bank was repr
sented by F. L. French, sales manager,'
Roger Bawden, district representative,
and Joe Mader, H. A. Dahl and
F. D. Bradford, real estate fieldmen.
Also attending the conference were
Roy W. Hendrix, assistant chief real
estate secretary, and Frank Jones,
farm service section, Farm Credit Ad
ministration, Washington, I). C.
The bank, according to Mr. French,
has always followed the practice of
selling farms acquired through fo reclosure
promptly. In this special sal
an effort will be made to transfer all
farms owned by the bank in these
counties, to local persons who want
them fo r homes or an investment
The bank feels that ttiis program will
be beneficial to the agricultural interest
nf this section for the reason that
absentee ownership of farm land is
usually not as desirable as ownership
by the man who lives on the farm.
The farms will not be sold at
auction. A ll sale negotiations will be
conducted privately with the bank’s
regular real estate fieldmen.
Where similar plans have been used
in other counties in recent months,
most all o f the farms owned by the
bank have been transferred to local
p* r^ons within a period o f ten days
to two weeks. It is expected that all
farms in these counties w ill likewise
be transferred to new owners in a
very few days. Such transfers are
made with only a reasonable cash payment,
the balance o f the purchase
price can be paid in yearly payments
— like rent.
For the period o f this special sale,
the bank has opened special sale
headquarters, A ntigo Federal Savings
and Loan Association Office, (Old
Fidelity Bank Bldg.), at Antigo, for
the convenience of those desiring to
buy a farm in these counties. Special
representatives o f the bank’s real estate
division will be in charge o f this
office and prospective buyers can have
the satifaction of dealing direct with
the bank through these men.

mile east o f Elderon on county trunk
K were totally destroyed by fire this
forenoon. The fire started in the
Norrbom garage, and spread instantly
to the adjoining buildings by a strong
southeast wind. Mr. Norrbom operates
a Chevrolet garage and is also
a dealer in farm implements, which
business he conducts on the farm
premises. It is reported that a blow
torch exploded while mechanics were
at work in tho garage, the accident
happening about 11:00 this forenoon.
A call was put in at once for the
Kland fire truck, which upon its arrival
shortly afterwards confined its
efforts to saving the modern farm
home.
The garage, granary, barn, silo,
machine sheds, corn crib, milk house,
and hen house were a mass o f flames
immediately and two used cars and
scores o f new and used fat m implements
were completely destroyed.
About a dozen used cars and several
new farm implements, including two
new John Deere tractors were saved.
About $400 worth o f new tires and all
tools and equipment perished with
the garage. It is estimated about 15
tons o f hay and 600 bushels of grain
were in the barn and granary. No
livestock was lost.
The loss o f farm implements alone
is estimated to run about $5,000, with
at least $10,000 worth o f farm buildings
going up in smoke. The N orrbom
farm has long been one o f the
show places in this part of the state.
Mr. Norrbom was in Janesville today
on business and was notified in
that city o f his shocking loss. It
could not be learned at this w riting
how much insurance was carried.

EUROPE:
Forgotten Patient
E a rly M ay found Poland the No. 1
source of European trouble, but the
cancerous sore had spread so fa r
afield that Poland’s woes w ere alm
ost forgotten. Specifically G ermany
wanted Danzig (whose 385,000
population is 96 per cent G erm a n )
and a 15-mile-wide path across the
Polish corridor to East Prussia. F a r
m ore adamant than her protectors,
Britain and France, little Poland
bravely let her foreign Minister Josef
Beck reject the R eich ’s demands
bluntly. N ext she gave dictatorial
powers to President Ignace Moscicki
and stoically awaited w hatever fate
m ight be shoved down her throat by
the machinations of Europe’s five
powers. President Moscicki watched
his nation’ s troubles spread into the
follow ing hopeless confusion:
Anglo-French solidarity, highly
touted a fter the Czecho-Slovakian
and M em el crises, had broken down
com pletely for want o f purposeful
direction. While Britain sw erved
back to appeasement policies and
outspokenly urged Poland to sur-

Hia troubles uere forgotten.
render Danzig, thereby courting
Italo-G erm an friendship, France
bluntly rejected an Italian offer to
settle the M editerranean problem.
Meanwhile both Britain and France
tried with left-handed diplom acy to
m ake Russia defend Polish integrity.
The Soviet took a sensible course,
standing aloof from any com m itments.
H aving fired Foreign Com m
issar M axim Litvin ov, who had
been leading the treaty conversations.
Russia gave vacillating
France and Britain a choice: Either
sign a double-barrelled m ilitary pact
fo r joint protection of eastern European
nations, or Moscow would
isolate itself and leave the dem ocracies
to stew in their own juice.
As is their wont, Rom e and Berlin
took advantage of this confusion.
A t Milan, F oreign Secretaries
^ Joachim von Ribbentrop and Count
Galeazzo Ciano expanded the axis
into an outright m ilitary pact which
resulted directly, London learned,
from F ran ce's refusal to arbitrate
the Mediterranean problem with Italy.
A dolf H itler once w rote (in Meim
Knm pf) that "a n alliance whose
purpose does not include the intention
to w age w ar is meaningless
and w orthless.” O bservers thought
the new Italo-G erm an pact held that
purpose as a threat which would
have three sorry results for the dem
ocracies:
(1) P re m ie r Mussolini would intervene
in the Polish-Germ an quarrel
just as he did in the Czech crisis
last Septem ber, using his nominal
friendship with individual Anglo-
French statesmen to help force a
plebiscite in Danzig and lead to a
repetition of the notorious Munich
settlem ent.

LABOR:
F D R Dog House
In 1922 a half million U. S. coal
m iners struck from April 1 to Septem
ber 6. In 1939 about 360,000 softcoal
miners went out again, not to
celebrate a seventeenth anniversary
but because C. I. O .’s John L. Lew is
ordered it. Reason: C. I. O .’s United
M ine W orkers demanded a closed
shop to protect itself against threatened
“ raids” by a rival A. F. of L.
union. Guided by U. S. Conciliator
John R. Steelman, em ployers and
C. I. O. representatives argued one
month to a stalem ate, operators offerin
g as their “ final” proposal a
checkoff system under which mines
would rem ain an open shop but dues
would be levied against both union
and non-union workers. C. I. O. rejected
this and by M ay 1 some 460,-
000 w orkers w ere idle. Meanwhile
the nation faced its worst coal shorta
ge since 1922.
Pressed by public opinion. President
R oosevelt finally decided his
conciliator should get tough. L ectured
Mr. Steelm an to w eary conferees
: “ I insist that you bring this
m atter to a civilized conclusion. It
ill behooves grown men . . . to seriously
contem plate open w arfa re
. . . Th e A m erica n public w ill not
stand for a state of insurrection
brought about by an industry involving
a vita l m inority o f our population.”
A few days la ter settlem ent appeared
im m inent; certainly not permanent,
but the sim ple type of settlem
ent John L ew is has offered all
along and which thus fa r had received
no consideration. Four times
before the 1937-39 contract expired,
U. M. W. A. proposed that it be extended
until a new agreem ent could
be drawn up. Only hitch is that by
sponsoring such a tem porary truce
(obviously in public interest) the
President is unavoidably siding with
C. I. O. against em ployees. A lread y
in the dog house so far as business
is concerned, this would hardly win
him any friends.
ASIA:
Up the River
Tw enty-tw o months ago China’ s
capital was Nanking. Japanese aggression
pushed it w estw ard up the
Y an gtze to Hankow, next backward
into Szechwan province and the ancient
w alled city of Chungking. P la y ing
a retreating gam e, Gen. Chiang
Kai-shek knows that the deeper he
can draw Japan into his bailiwick,
the easier w ill China’s resistance be.
C H IN A A N D H E R C A P IT A L S
Japan it prepared to follow.
But G en eralissim o Chiang did not
expect what happened next.
Into Chungking (norm ally 835,000
population) sw arm ed 1,500,000 refugees,
in itself a grave problem . Then
one day 45 Japanese w ar planes
sw arm ed o ver Chungking, dropping
inccndiary bombs and dem olitioners,
m ore than 100 in all. When the
smoke cleared China could count
5,000 casualties, a ruined capital and
tem pora rily blasted m orale. G ermany
and B ritain found their em bassies
destroyed. For all concerned
it seem ed best to m ove the capitalon-
wheels again, this tim e 150 m iles
northeast into Chengtu, whose norm
al half m illion population w ill autom
atically double overnight.
Peace-loving Chengtu m ight w ell
regard this official invasion as a
death sentence. General Chiang
probably hopes an off-the-river capital
m ay break his bad luck jinx,
but Tokyo thinks otherwise. Despite
British protests that Chungking's
bombing w as purely terroristic and
w ithout a definite m ilitary objective,
Nippon's w arriors announced their
death planes w ere prepared to follow
China's capital w herever it m ay
roam.

A lb ert Einstein once said that to
And the nucleus o f an atom was like

which turn out neutrons (uncharged

scientists disintegrate uranium

W A S H IN G T O N —Jesse H. Jones,
the Houston banker who has been
the “ g rea test lender in the w orld ”
as head o f the R F C since he was
appointed to that body by President
H oover, w as recently offered the
post o f secretary of the navy by
President Roosevelt, but declined it
w ith thanks.
Jesse's friends insist that It w as
nothing but a m ove to shelve him,
as everybod y knows that the post of
secreta ry o f the navy under this administration
is m erely a niche fo r a
figurehead.
Th e suggestion was m ade by the
President fo r two reasons. One w as j
that he Intended at the tim e to |
transfer R F C , under his powers
granted by congress in the reo rg a nization
bill, to the departm ent o f
JESSE H. JONES
com m erce, where it would be under
H a rry L . Hopkir.s.
By the w ay, this is still m ystifyin g
insiders, who know that Hopkins
personally believes his health w ill
fo rc e absolute retirem ent, within a
year.
I f Jones had accepted, it was
m ade clear to him by the President,
E m il Schram, now a m em ber of the
board o f directors o f R F C , would
be put in Jones' place, but would of
course have been under Hopkins.
Jones' E conom ic Views
H eld in Low Esteem
Th e other reason fo r the m ove the
Presiden t thought about m aking was
that while he has g rea t respect for
Jones’ ability, he has none for his
econom ic and social view s, regard s
him as a potential enem y to the
N ew Deal, and dislikes his political
ties.
In fact, the p roffer o f the navy
portfolio was m ade only a fter se vera
l senators and m em bers of the
house, with whom the President had
discussed changes he proposed m aking
under the reorganization bill,
told him he would run into a hornet’s
nest on Capitol Hill if he tried
kicking Jesse Jones around.
The President w as told that there
w as not only the certainty o f trouble,
but the real probability that
congress m ight actually veto the
whole set of changes— under its powe
r to disapprove within 60 days— if
the President should attem pt to put
Jones, in whom Congress has great
confidence, under Hopkins, about
whom congress is v e r y skeptical.
So he tried tn kick Jones upstairs,
but Jones preferred the floor he has
been working so long.
As a m atter o f fact, Jones, though
a conservative at heart, is probably
the most powerful figure in W ashington
outside the White House and
its im m ediate environs,

llusiness Filters Period
O f W atchful W aitinn
"W atch fu l W a itin g” is now the
I attitude of business, big and little,
as contrasted with the ea rlier prodding
and pleading fo r relie f at the
j hands o f congrcss from w hat it regards
ns the harsh and distorted
econom ic philosophy of the N ew
Deal.
Answer? Tw ofold. Business believes
firm ly that it w ill get relie f
from N ew Deal oppression—not only
changes in the law, but in the adm
inistrative agencics— as a result
of the election next year.
The second reason is the possibility
o f war. W a r in Europe without
the United States participating
would mean a spurt in business
here. War with the United States
participating — and m ost business
men think w e could not stay out—
would mean a ctivity to the utmost
of everybod y’s power, just as in 1917
and 1918.
A ll of which m akes most o f the
(lending legislation, in which norm
ally there would be tremendous
interest, of much loss im portance to
thc people m ost affected. F o r instance,
neutrality. N o one believes
any neutrality la w ' now enacted
would stand 10 days if w ar broke out
and it w e re m an ifest that the new
law in terfered w ith som ething this
govern m en t w anted to do—help the
d em ocracies, fo r exam p le, by shipm
ents o f w a r supplies which would
be forbidden by the law.
A s fo r taxes, every on e knows that
if the United States got into the w ar
there would have to be a new tax
law , which must raise e v e r so much
m ore m oney than at present. This
would m ake w h atever tax revision
m igh t be passed this session unimportant.
N ot that anyone thinks
there would rea lly be any thing like
the Bone m easure, designed to
"ta k e the profits out o f w a r.”
Wagner Act Useless
In Event of War
Then take W a gn er act revision.
E v ery o n e knows congress would
act v e ry differen tly in a w a r em ergency
in dealin g with amendm ents
to this law , if indeed there w ere any
necessity fo r touching it at all in
a w a r em ergen cy. L a b o r’s attitude
would be v e ry different. Th ere
would be little interest and no sym pathy
fo r any m o ve to restrict
hours, all the pressure in the world
fo r g ettin g m ore w ages.
And consider the w ag e and hour
act. T h ere would be no inclination
to rem ov e any floor under w a g e le v els.
In w artim e that would take
ca re o f itself. But there would be
trem endous opposition to any attem
pt to restrict w orking hours.
So, all in all, with the prospect of
a m ore frien dly President who
would sign legislation from a m ore
friendly congress (ev ery o n e knows
that it would be te rrib ly difficult to
muster a two-thirds vote to o v erride
a R oosevelt veto o f any change
in existing law that he did not app
ro v e ), plus the possibility o f a war
em ergen cy, w hy get all hot and
bothered about changes which would
run only (a ) until the next P re sident
cam e in, or (b ) until wax
broke?
Roosevelt Reverts to
Quarterback Tactics
T w o developm en ts in connection
with F ranklin D. R o ose velt’s recent
actions hint a rem a rk ab le change in
his role as political leader. They
revea l a new R oosevelt, apparently
a com p rom iser, but perhaps, to revert
to his own description o f himse
lf long ago, a quarterback, c ir cum
venting his opponents by trick
plays rather than ruthlessly crushing
them by overw h elm in g force.
It m ay be, o f course, that he
learned som ething from the purges,
both the nine he lost
and the one he won.
In the nine he lost
he discovered that
he could not defeat
the senators on their
hom e grounds. In
the one he won, that
fight against John J.
O’Connor, he discovered
that the price
o f v ic to ry was high
and its fruit disappointing.
He beat
O’Connor. He obtained
thereby the selection o f everfaithful
Adolph J. Sabath, o f I llinois,
as chairm an o f the powerful
house rules com m ittee, and he has
seen the actual pow er in that com m
ittee. as a d irect result of the defeat
o f O ’Connor, pass into the hands
o f Eugene E . Cox, o f G eorgia, who
a vera g es ten instances of opposition
to N ew D eal ob jectives to e v ery
one o f O ’Connor’s insurgencies.
Th e tw o recent instances, which
are taken by some to indicate a
change in R oosevelt, rela te to two
men, both o f whom a re D em ocrats,
one o f whom is intensely conservative
at heart, and the other fo rm e rly
rega rd ed as much m ore radical
than R oosevelt him self. Th e conserva
tive is Jesse H. Jones. The
radical is Sen. Burton K . W heeler.
W heeler in Background
D uring 1932 Campaign
With tw o other radicals, W heeler
w as kept in the background during
the 1932 cam paign. It was thought
that R oosevelt w as sure o f the libera
l vote, as against H erb ert Hoove
r, and hence speeches by W heeler,
H uey Long and C larence C. Dill
would do him little good. In fact
they m ight do harm by alienating
con servative support.
A fte r the election W heeler found
he was sidetracked for a different
reason. The President was very
fond, personally, o f Bruce K ra m er,
for yea rs national com m itteem an
from Montana, and W h eeler’s bitterest
political enem y in the state. As
a result K ra m er got all the gra v y,
and W heeler w as ignored.
W heeler sizzled within, but kept
peace on the surface, fo r five years.
But if he was bidding his tim e for
revenge, he could not have planned
it better him self when the opportunity
to oppose the President on the
Suprem e court issue presented itself.
N ow the President is courting
W heeler. One m ight think W heeler
w as the only m an on C apitol Hill
he trusted!
It isn’ t like R o osevelt! Assum ing
its genuineness, it is the first tim e
o f record he has e v e r fo rgiven anyone
who dealt him such a blow— and
a blow below the belt, as he regarded
it— as W heeler gave him on
the court issue.
N or is it like R oosevelt to abandon
his schem e to get rid o f Jesse
Jones without a fight, m erely because
he was told Jones had too
m any friends on C apitol Hill to make
possible his being shifted under H a rry
L. Hopkins! It’s worth waiting
for the last act!

“ T r y to understand,” she continued

though I'm not sure o f it, that Jane
w as getting a little suspicious about
the m ilk. I had her lea ve it in the
bu tler's pantry, but before Rose
took it up I slipped in from the
dining-room and added the m ercu ry.
Once Jane cam e in from the kitchen

as if that was what I w as a fter, and

T h e first tim e that happened I used

I was going to say 1 had com e to

afra id o f a storm . But I was startled
and got out. I didn’ t dare to
risk going again till tonight. Then
I had to add the m ercu ry to the

the m ilk. I thought Jane had acted

odd, too, that she and Rose kept so

to suspect that they w ere w atchin

She stopped a mom ent, as if turning

“ I s e e ."
H a le had stopped before he.- again
and w as staring down at her.
“ I don’t think I did Joan much

Miss Hosanna nodded.
“ I thought you would m arry her,”

“ Y es , I see, all right. N ow , listen

M iss Hosanna’s gray head, with
Its incongruous coverin g o f sleeping

“ I expect to go aw ay, o f cou rse,"

" Y e s ,” R e x agreed dully, “ that

“ H ow can l te ll? ” H er head
drooped and she stared down at the
floor. “ You aren 't g ivin g m e much

Suddenly her teatures twisted. “ I ’m

rest som ewhere. Then I 'll look for
a position."
H ale, who had been standing befo

at the w ater, turned and cam e back
to her.
" I w ill persuade your brother to

in a level voice, "an d to g ive you

She sighed.
“ Y ou shouldn’t be so cruel. You

" Y o u 'r e going to have a busy

A s he spoke he crossed the room,

“ Y ou ’ll say you’ ve had a breakdown,

“ Y ou won’t even te ll Joan?”
"J o a n least o f all. N o one w ill

H e turned his eyes aw ay from her

“ I suppose I have no m oral

H e m ade a gesture o f fu tility and
went on in a differen t tone.
‘ ‘ I ’ll talk to your brother tom orrow

H er m om entary look of re lie f w as
gone. She sat tw isting her hands,
her eyes on the floor.
H a le did not look at her. He
could not endure another flash of
re lie f against that ghastly background.
“ L a te r, a fter a y e a r or tw o ," he
told her, “ you can w rite your brothe

he w ill have no objections to such a

“ Thank you. I think you m ean
to be m ercifu l.”
She got up and cam e toward him
with outstretched, shaking hands,
but he quickly stepped back out of
her reach.
“ P lease don’ t touch m e ," he said.
“ I couldn't stand that. You can
count on m e to put everyth in g
through, though. I suppose I can
count on you to—to—”
“ T o be different h ereafter?” she
asked under her breath. " Y e s , you

He interrupted her. “ Does Mrs.
Spencer Forbes rea lize w hat's been
going on?”
“ Ruth! Good God, no. She must
never know .”
Notwithstanding his first recoil
she caught his a rm and clung to
him.
“ She has been w atching you,” he
pointed out.
“ She has been w orried about m e.
She has seen that something was
wrong. She was w atching B ert, too.
She w as suspicious about B ert— because
she knew he'd get Joan's
money. She w arned m e about him.
She thought— R ex, you w ill never
let her know, w ill you ?”
H e released his arm and m oved

Just how does it feel to play

“ I'm glad the gam e is over,” Rex

It w asn’t Uke him to be serious.
“ D idn't it strike you that Aunt Hosanna

R e x nodded.
" I suppose she was relieved to

" I t ’s one o f the things I shall a lw

“ I ca n 't understand yet why

that is brand new at the N ew York
W orld ’s fa ir is television, which took
its bow with a telecast at the inaugural
cerem onies.
Unlike B ritain's g srret inventor,
John L o g ie Baird, A llen B.
Du Mont, putting his by-line on
the new television set, cam e
along through the "channels” in
which prom ising young technicians
are grooved these days.
Out o f R ensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in 1923, he w as em ployed
as a tube engineer with
the Westinghouse company in
B loom field, N. J „ until 1937,
when he becam e chief engineer
o f the De F orest Radio com pany.
But, when he caught the
television germ , he did just what
B aird did. the only difference being
that he holed up in a cellar
Instead o f an attic.
It was in 1931 that he quit a good
Job to play a hunch. The hunch
was that the cathode ray was the
jok er in the flickering television
deck. So he dived into his basement,
built his laboratory and stayed
underground until he was ready to
com e up with a cathode-ray tube
which is pretty nearly the works in
television.
In 1937, M r. Du Mont rounded
op som e capital and built a sirable
two-story laboratory at
M ontclair, N. J „ em ploying 42
m en. By 1938, Param ount pictures
had declared itself in in
a big w ay. and, at last accounts,
M r. Du M ont’s enterprise was
virtu ally a subsidiary of this corporation.
Th at is interesting in
view of the fa ct that, in England,
they already are televising
events for the m oving picture
screen. It is indicated that the
Du Mont rig m ay be subject to
the sam e developm ent.

but it’ s not the fault o f the

story of the picture is laid in
Louisiana; it deals with plantation
life in pre-C ivil war
days. One o f the high lights
of the picture is a sugar cane
festival, the autumn celebration
that m arks the com pletion
of the harvesting season.
Lesser ordered a freigh t c a r o f Louisiana
sugar cane, and thought
things w ere all set, when the C alifornia
bureau of agriculture stepped
in and stopped it at the border.
Seem s that " fo r e ig n " cane can’ t be

Before a bill which proposes to put
“ America’s Dairyland” on the plates
beginning in 1940 was engrossed, opponents
tried to kill the bill by ridicule,
by introducing nine amendments
all o f which were killed. Most o f the
amendments would have substituted
other words for the ones finally
adopted, with “ where friends and na
ture meet,” “ relax in Wisconsin, the
beer section of the nation,” “ cheese,
butter, poultry, milk, corn, and hogs,”
“ heart o f America,” “ Dairyland—

Rural Telephone Needs
The state public service commission’s
efforts to get smaller telephone
exchanges exempt from the provisions
o f the federal wage and hour law have
been renewed with Commissioner
Robert A. N ixon’s visit in Washing
ton, D. C., to discuss the proposed exemptions
with Wisconsin congressional
members and wage and hour officials.
Commission investigation showed
that if the provisions o f the act were
applied to all o f the 750 telephone
companies in the state, many exchanges
would be wiped out because
rates in many cases would have to be
doubled; there would be a reduction in
telephone usage in smaller communities
and rural areas; and telephone
operators might be thrown out o f work
by the installation o f dial or other
automatic service and through smaller
exchanges going out o f business.
The state administrative body wants
exemption from the act for all exchanges
with few er than 1,000 phones.
Pending congressional legislation
would permit exemption fo r only e x changes
with not more than 500
phones. I f the requested exemption
is granted, few er than 100 exchanges
will come under the act.
For Sunday Driving
For the sixth consecutive year heavy
trucks w ill be barred from 18 o f
the state’s busiest highways on w eekends
ami holidays, starting Memorial
Day and ending in mid-September,
under a public service commission o r der.
From 1 p. m. to 11 p. m. Saturdays
and from 9 a. m. to midnight on Sundays
and holidays, trucks of more than
6,000 pounds will not be allowed on
highways 12. 13, 14, 15. 16, 18, 19, 26.
30, 41, 42, 45, 50, 51, 55, 57, 100, 141,
except trucks carrying livestock, fresh
fish, fluid milk or cream, fresh vegetables,
fresh fruit, ice cream, fresh
bakery goods, ice, or newspapers
Trucks used fo r emergency purposes
also are exempt.
Wisconsin was the first state to
adopt such regulations to promote
safety and relieve traffic congestion.
Since the first order was issued several
other states have copied the regulations
or enacted them into law, and
W’ isconsin has received praise in more
than 3,000 American newspapers for
pioneering in this type o f regulation.
“ N ot in a H urry”
Governor Heil told interviewers last
week that he was “ not interested in a
short session o f the legislature. We
want to create the best laws possible
for the people. I am not in a hurry
to send them home,” he said of assemblymen
and senators.
H eil’s statements contrasted with
rumors in the statehouse that Republican
leaders had secretly drafted a
resolution calling for a “ sine die” adjournment
June 15.
Orphan Home Commencement
Commencement exercises o f the
school at the Homme Orphan Home
were held last evening. Edward Nutter,
Raymond Gehrke, Milo Peterson,
Gordon Luick and Gerald Worden were
the five graduating pupils from the
eighth grade. Rev. P. P. Houglum
gave the invocation. Edward Nutter
gave the address o f welcome. The
Rev. P. A. Wahl gave the commence
ment address and remarks were made
by Manager R. L. Lokensgard and
teacher, R. Wrolstad. Other numbers
on the program were two songs by
the sextet from the W ittenbeig high
school, flow er pantomime by the Home

Carter, a man who was born in E n g -: 11/ |i v ill
land and who knows something o f the
devious ways of European politics
advises us to keep out o f Europe's
quarrels and clean up our own back
yard. Burton Holmes, in slightly
different language, endorses these
opinions and he is a man who ha**
lived in all o f the w arring im perialisms
abroad and knows conditions at
first hand.
Meanwhile, our country is being
flooded with propaganda o f the most
vicious kind. Not a story is printed
concerning conditions abroad that is
not covered with pro-British or pro-
French sympathy. These two nations
are held up to American eyes as the
potential saviours o f mankind, heroic
sacrifices o f self in order that democracies
shall not be overwhelmed.
Germany and Italy, the goats of the
Versailles treaty, are pictured as
devils who threaten the destruction of
all good things. Not a word is said
in appreciation o f good old Uncle
Sam’s participation in the World war
and, o f course, no mention is ever
made o f the billions of unpaid debts.
The king and queen o f England are
being groomed as hands-across-thesea
emissaries to remind us that, in
event o f trouble, blood is thicker than
water, even if it is more expensive.
The fact that our population is made
up o f people, 75 per cent o f whom
have no trace o f English blood in their
veins, makes no difference. Our g o vernment
is in the hands of men who
have, or whose sympathy lie in that
direction, and that is all that matters.
Anyone who knows history knows
that the rival powers o f Europe are
all tarred with the same brush; that
such a thing as an unselfish impulse
concerning small nations never enters
the head o f Chamberlain or Daladier
any more than it does that o f a H itler
or Mussolini. Anyone who remembers j struck the Chung King power station,

How did Porterhouse Steak get its
name?
From the Porter House, a hotel in
Lorain, Ohio, when Charles Dickens,
touring the U. S. in 1842, was served
an unusually delicious steak. Delighted
he spread its fam e everywhere, always
referring to it as the Porter House
steak. Soon leading hotels began to
apply the name to their finest steaks.
Boycott—
A t a recent convocation o f approximately
500 Lutheran women a motion
was passed to protest to our congressman
the sale o f iron and other products
aiding Japan with its war on
China— called by many the cruellest
war ever waged. Recently in an air
raid on Chungking, present capitol of
China, thousands o f helpers, men,
women, and children were cruelly
killed.
From Time, May 15, 1939, we quote:

The four men pictured above, left

tenor, W ittenberg; Herbert U pright,
first tenor, Kenosha; William Clem ents,
baritone, Pittsville; and Gerald
Torkelson, bass, Merrill. They comprise
the Male Quartet o f State Teachers
College at Stevens Point, which
has made quite a name fo r itself and
is in great demand for entertainment
at social functions. The first three are
members o f the Rural State Graded
Division and the last named young
man is in the Secondary Education
Division. Cowles and Clements are
seniors and have been in the quartet
during their four years in Stevens
Point. Mr. Cowles has developed a
fine mixed chorus in the division of
Rural-State Graded Education. This
has been entirely student initiated and
directed and deserves the appreciation
it has received.
“ W e are very proud o f this young
man from your community,” is the
word we have received from a member
o f the faculty o f the Stevens Point
school.

Anyone who views the present situations
carefully must recognize that
our state department and our president
are anything but neutral in the
contemporary European mess. So far
as our government is concerned, we
are committed now as we were under
Wilson and that in the event of
trouble abroad in the nature o f a

Such a step will inevitably lead to
a revolution at home, a revolution
which will result in an American dictator
who will be a representative o f
big business. I do not, for one moment,
believe that the president himself
would desire such a thing to hap- j

that he is doing the best that can
be done to insure the continuance of
democratic governments and institutions
on this earth.

“ Two Wanted M en”
He l l o e v e r y b o d y :
You know, boys and girls, in some of these adventure
yarns I ’ ve been telling you, everythin g seems to happen a ll in
a split second. Just one— two— three and it’ s a ll over, with action
every doggone minute.
Then there are other yarns in which there’ s darned little
action, and the suspense of the story lies in the fa ct that some
poor d evil has to stand still while death com es creeping up on
him. That sort of adventure drags out for a long tim e.
But the yarn I ’ m going to tell you today is like both o f those
above-mentioned types o f adventures. It went on for a long
time, and every doggone minute o f that tim e was packed with
danger and suspense. And at the sam e tim e, it was so full of
action that you’ d have a hard tim e packing another single
m ovem ent into it.
It’ s one of the most thrilling tales I ’ v e com e across in quite a
while, and the honors today go to a Chicago policeman—A lb ert
R ickert of Chicago.
It was a cool September afternoon in 1927. A l was off
duty, and with tim e on his hands, he went over to the home
o f his pal. Em m ett Hartnett, for a visit. A fte r he'd been there awhile,
they decided it would be a good idea to go for a ride. Em m ett got a
car and they drove around for about two hours.
They w ere on their w ay to a restaurant when things began to
happen. As they drove along a sm all sedan passed them. Th ere
w ere tw o men in the car, and A l recognized them both as autom
obile th ieves!
Thieves Recognize A l as Policem an.
A l told Em m ett to turn around and follow that car. Th ey w ere
catching up to it when the thieves spotted the auto behind them and
recognized A l as a policem an. Th ey stepped on the gas— and the
chase was on !
Th e car in front o f them leaped ahead. Em m ett stepped on it and
followed. The faster they went, the faster the sm aller ca r ahead traveled.
A l pulled out his gun and tired one shot. But the ca r ahead didn't stop.
Both those gas buggies w ere tearing along down the street
at close to top speed. The scenery w as fa irly w hitzing past,
and people along the w ay stopped to stare at a race they bad
never seen the like of outside of a race track.

And then he was being dragged along behind the fleeing car.
running board to get a better shot at his quarry. As Em m ett
drove and the car careened along the w ide street he fired again
and again. Still the car ahead sped on:
Now , Al could see that they w ere gaining on the crooks. Th e sm all
ca r didn't have speed enough to outdistance the big one in which they
w ere riding. A l continued to fire until his rev o lve r was em pty.
A l's C a r Nosed Alongside the Thieves.
The big car had almost caught up to the little one now. Bit by bit
they gained until at last A l's ca r was nosing up beside the one in which
the two thieves w ere riding. Th ey w ere running alm ost hood to hood
now, and A l could have reached out and touched the other auto, when
suddenly the front car turned sharply.
A l saw the crooks’ car sw erving toward them , but before he had a
chance to do anything about it, there was a crash. T h e crooks sideswiped
them, knocking them over to the side o f the street.
Th ere was another crash as the car lurched into ■ telephone
pole, but A l w asn't inside the car when it hit. As the two c a n
cam e together he was caught between them and knocked down
on the running board.
Then, as the sm aller ca r veered away again, his right leg was
pinched between its rear fender and the bumper. H e fe lt a tug at
that leg— fe lt him self falling to the pavem ent— and then he was being
dragged along behind the fleeing car.
The ca r w as out o f control now. The crook at the w heel was trying
to keep it going straight, but it shot up o ver the curb on the other side
of the street. It crossed the sidewalk and plunged on over a stretch
o f bare, water-soaked prairie.
D ragged along behind it, A l felt a terrific bump as his body
was pulled o ver the curb. There was a terrible pain in his im prisoned
leg where the tire was scraping the flesh aw ay. His
bark and sides w ere being bruised and lacerated.
The car traveled a hundred feet through the p rairie and by
that tim e Al was numb from pain and shock. Then the car
bogged down in the mud and cam e to a stop. A l's clothes
had been literally torn from his body by then, but he still had his
gun clutched tightly in his hand.
He Struggled to Get His L e g Out of the T rap.
“ Th ere w a s no chance to use it,” he says, "b u t as soon as the car
cam e to a halt, I began struggling to get m y leg out o f its trap. The
d riv er jum ped out and ran north across the prairie
“ A t last I got m y leg loose and craw led out from under the car.
1 raised m y gun and pulled the trigger, but all I got w as a click of the
ham m er. In the excitem ent I had forgotten that I em ptied the gun during
the chase.”
A s the gun clicked, the second man leaped from the ca r and started
to run. And then A l m ade the pinch of his life. Helpless and unable to j
walk, much less run after the fleeing crook, he got up on his feet and i
threw the em pty gun after him.
That gun went straight to the m ark. It caught the cruok
nn the hack of the head and he fell forw ard on his fa r e —out cold.
A t the sam e m om ent Em m ett extricated him self from his w recked
car and cam e running across the street, lie grabbed the crook.
E m m ett took them both to a restaurant a block aw ay and there
he called the station-house. Th ey took A l to the Peop le's hospital, and
he stayed there for three months, getting o ver the injury to his leg. The
rea r tire had ground a ridge right into the flesh as the ca r dragged
him across the prairie.
The crook he caught drew a 14-year sentence. The other one was
shot down by an Englewood policem an three days later— in another
stolen car.

Advises Extra Care in Storing Foods in the Home
B y C. HO USTO N G OUDISS
IT IS the proud distinction o f A m e ric a ’ s food industries that
notwithstanding the infinite va riety o f perishable food*
which a re constantly availab le, and regard less o f the distances
they have been transported, even the m ost delicate
foods a re delivered to the consum er in a fresh, w holesom e
condition, with a ll their fine flavor unimpaired.
The secret o f this m odern m ira cle is refrigeration . Vast
sums o f m oney have been invested in long trains o f r e fr ig e r ated
cars, thousands upon
th o u s a n d s o f r e f r i g e r a t e d
tr u c k s , r e f r i g e r a t e d w areh
o u s e s a n d r e f r i g e r a t i o n
equipm ent in stores. A ll this
has been done for a single
purpose: to keep food fresh
and at its best untikit reaches
the home.
A t this point the responsibility
shifts to the hom em aker. And if
she fa lls down on her Job, then all
previous efforts to keep food fre e
from sp oila ge have been in vain.
H om em a ker’ s Responsibility
A s guardian of her fa m ily ’s
health, one o f the h om em aker's
m o s t im portant
tasks is to see to it
that all food is safeguarded
against
contam ination until
it reaches her
table. Th is means
t h a t perishable
foods must continue
to be re frig e ra ted
prop erly in the
home. F o r only in
this w ay can they
be protected from
the ra v a g e s o f m icro-organism s
which a re a lw a ys ready to attack
foods when conditions a re fa v o ra ble
fo r their growth.
T w o essentials are necessary for
sa tisfa ctory food preservation in
the home. F irst, perishable foods
must be stored at a tem perature
o f from 40 to 45 degrees Fah renheit—
never at a tem peratu re higher
than 50 degrees. Second, the
righ t d e g re e o f hum idity must be
m aintained. T o o much moisture
w ill encou rage the growth o f bacte
r ia ; too little w ill dehydrate
fru its and vegetab les and m ake
them unfit fo r consumption.
H om e C are of Foods
Both requirem ents a re m et by
a good household re frig e ra to r;
and the hom em aker who appreciates
the im portan ce o f keeping
foods sound and w holesom e w ill
reg a rd an efficien t re frig e ra to r as
an investm ent in good health. It
is esp ecia lly necessary that the
food supply be p rop erly r e frig e ra ted
during the w a rm er w eath er of
spring and sum m er, in o rd er to
p reven t the consumption o f dishes
that m ay h a ve becom e contam inated
without any m arked a lte ra tion
in appearance, taste or odor.
H ig h ly Perish able Foods
Milk is often regarded as the
most perishable of all foods, because
it is an ideal medium for
the growth of bacteria. It is, therefore.
essential that this splendid
food be kept at low temperatures
the refrig e ra to r as soon as possible
a fter it is delivered , and kept
there until the m om ent it is to be
used. M ilk should n ever be a llow
ed to stand at room tem p era ture
for any length o f tim e. F o r
it has been dem onstrated that
when it is held at 40 d eg rees— an
ideal tem peratu re— b efore d e liv ery
, then allow ed to stand at a
room tem peratu re o f 75 degrees
fo r an hour and a half, and again
r efrig e ra ted , a rapid increase in
bacteria occurs.
Other types o f protein foods also
present a fa v o ra b le m edium for
b a cteria l grow th when they a re
held at tem peratu res higher than
50 degrees. These ii? lu d e m eat,
fish, m eat broths, gelatin, custards
and cream ed foods. It is a d visa ble
to keep these foods, as w ell a t
the m ilk supply, in the coldest
part o f the refrig e ra to r.
Fruits and V egetables
F ru its and vegetab les soon lose
their m oisture content unless they
are protected against w arm , d ry
a ir; and they a re likew ise su bject
to th « action o f m icro-organism s
which result in decay. But when
stored in a m odern refrig e ra to r,
these m in e r a l and vitam in -rich
foods can be kept in p erfect condition
fo r considerable periods, thus
m aking it possible to take advantage
o f fa vo ra b le m ark et offerings.
Guarding Against Mold
A s a rule, w a rm er w eather also
increases the problem o f com b ating
molds. F o r given m oisture
and w arm th , m olds w ill grow on
alm ost anything. H ow ever, the
m ost hospitable hosts a re acid
fruits, such as oranges, lem ons,
b erries or tom atoes; sw eets, such
as ja m s and je llie s ; bread and
m eat. W hile m olds are physiolo
g ica lly harm less if eaten, they
definitely spoil the taste and appearance
of food.
Mold grow ths can be killed by
boiling. Th ey are retarded by the
dry circu latin g a ir o f an efficien t
refrig e ra to r. It is to a llow fo r
a ir circulation that berries should
be stored uncovered— if possible,
spread out so that the a ir ca a
reach m ore than just the top
layer.
F requent inspection o f all food
supplies, including those in the
bread box, and the prom pt e lim ination
o f any item s showing signs
o f m old, w ill help to keep it from
spreading.
Constant vig ila n ce on the part of
the hom em aker in ca rin g for foods
on hand w ill avoid a needless
drain on the food budget and w ill
safeguard the health o f e v e ry

Long-Haired Sheriff
p O M M O D O R E P E R R Y OW ENS,
born in Tennessee in 1852, went
to T e x a s in the ea rly seventies and
spent 11 yea rs there as a cowboy
b efore becom ing forem an of a cow
outfit in N ew M exico. He wore his
hair long— almost to his w aist—and
ca rried his six-shooter on his left
side, the butt pointing forw ard. Old
tim ers in the Southwest w ere doubtful
w hether such a “ show -off" had
“ rea l sand.”
Th ey found out he did have when,
singlehanded, he killed three N avajo
Indian cattle thieves. Then the people
o f northern A rizona decided he
w as the man to clean up the outlaws
in their section and elected him
sh eriff of Apache county in 1887.
He broke up a band of 16 cattle
rustlers a fter killing Ike Clanton of
Tom bstone fam e and two others and
capturing his brother, Finn Clanton,
lea der o f the gang.
But his greatest feat was his single-
handed fight with four m em bers
of the Blevans gang, one of the factions
in the fam ous Pleasant Valley
w ar. In this fight, which took place
in Holbrook, P e rry killed three of
the four, including Andy CooDer. one
o f A rizona’s most dangerous gunfighters.
It was one of thc most
desperate encounters at close quarters
in the history of the state, not
even excepting the famous fight at
the O. K. corra l in Tombstone.

First in Yellowstone Park
1 1 7 H A T an adventure it must
* * have been for the first person
who saw the Yellow stone! John Colj
ter, who for three years had served
j in the famous Lew is and Clark exi
pedition, was the lucky man. He
j had just left the party and established
him self with the expedition
I o f Manuel Lisa from St. Louis who
[ traveled up the Missouri rive r to
j trade with the Indians.
A fort was established at the Big
Horn and John Colter was sent
ahead to notify the red men. With
courage typical of that period, he
began his lone expedition into territory
never before trod by even the
m ost courageous trappers and pioneers
o f the time.
Inform ed by the Indians that
ahead lay a territory that was bedeviled
and that they would not penetrate
it, his curiosity and his adventurous
spirit im pelled him to explore
it. He was w ell rew arded for
records show that, in 1808, he went
through and then com p letely en circled
what is now Yellow stone national
park.
Alone, he saw before any other
person, the boiling springs, tow ering
geysers and strange m ineral deposits.
Not only was he a pioneer
among white men, but m ore adventurous
than even the red men, being
years ahead o f them in risking e x istence
in a land where the earth
trem bled and groaned, spouted fire
and hissed steam.
When Colter returned, he told
such an am azing story of smoking
pits and the sm ell of brim stone that
the men of the fort laughed at him
and told others what they thought
w ere ridiculous stories o f “ C olter’s
H ell.” It was severa l yea rs before
anyone else had the courage to ve rify
his discovery.
