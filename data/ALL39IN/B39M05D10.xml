         <p>Several Fires in County
There have been several fires in
the county during the past week and
the continued dry weather makes it
more o f a hazard daily In all the
Ranger Station reports that there
have been 83 fires in the district
since the beginning of the season
since the snow went off and 25 in
the district the past week Rain will
allay the trouble to a great extent 
and the fact that there was three quarters
of an inch at Wisconsin
Dells on Monday eases the situation a
little in that section 
Friday night a fire at Bell Mound
burned over some 30 acres starting
at 4 30 p m A crew of men from
Camp Irving helped get the fire under
control 
Friday a fire started south and
west o f Millston in the town o f Manchester 
the largest of the season 
burning over 300 acres before it was
under control A crew from City
Point and local men fought the fire 
Saturday a chimney fire in the
home of Joseph and James Murray in
Pine H ill spread to the roof and
burned the house The fire spread
to the woods in the vicinity and caused
considerable damage The department
from the Rangers helped
fight the fire and a crew from Irvin
g was also on the job 
About 2 p m Tuesday yesterday 
a fire apparently started by a careless
smoker started a mile and a half
south o f Millston on old highway 12 
and burned over some 10 acres before
the fire fighters from the department
and Camp Irving got it under
control in spite of the strong
wind 
About noon Tuesday the house on
highway 12 north of Merrillan which
burned to the ground in a very short
time started a fire in the fields but
the Rangers had it under control before
it got away burning less than
a h a lf acre A n account of the fire
may be found in the Merrillan news 
A fire started close to the Mose
Paquette place on Robinson creek 
near Polleys Dam this morning also
started it appeared by a smoker 
Fifty-five acres were burned over before
it was under control The house
was not burned 
The fire situation is very grave 
with no promise of rain in sight Extreme
care should be exercised by
every one

There will be no Saturday May
13th opening for Wisconsin trout
fishermen The season will open next
Monday May 15th as originally planned

and thinking they can have
trout for breakfast Saturday morning 
The assembly voted to permit a
Saturday opening but Tuesday morning
the senate voted 23 to 4 to let
the May 15th opening stand 
Warden Putnam reports the four
following former fish refuges as open

Are you going to entertain tourists
this summer
I f so here are some suggestions
for making comfortable the rooms or
cabins you re going to rent These
are given by Wealthy Hale and Mrs 
Margaret McCordic of the University
of Wisconsin home economics staff 
who have been making a survey of
this industry 
First o f all they think rooms for
tourists should be attractive and
clean as well as conveniently and
comfortably arranged There should
be safe cold drinking water with
clean water pitcher and glasses and
plenty of hot running water 
Tourists want a restful place to
sleep a goed bed with coil spring and
a clean comfortable mattress preferably
an innerspring mattress Miss
Hale and Mrs McCordic advise using
sheets that are 108 inches torn length
or 103 inches finished length Plenty
o f clean blankets and an attractive
washable spread complete the actual
sleeping arrangements 
To add to the enjoyment of your
tourist guests the two recommend a
well-lighted desk or table Guests
will be delighted with your thoughtfulness
if ink and blotters are on it 
The room might contain also one
large comfortable chair and one
straight chair as well as a rack for
luggage 
Plenty of hangers in a convenient
place to hank clothes will increase
the tourists contentment A wastebasket
is necessary for convenience
and a metal one for safety 
 A road map and calendar in the
rooms will add to the convenience of
the guests the specialists points out 
 Near the register might be travel in formation 
maps o f adjoining states
and one o f the United States showing
highways cards or circulars of tourists
rooms in other towns and other
information as good eating places 
laundry dry cleaner tailor and
church notices 
I f you have more than three rooms
to rent application blanks for inspection
and for rules and regulations
may be secured from the State Board

The first rural electric coop to select
a woman for its president is one
in Illinois This association recently
received a loan of 403 000 from the
Rural Electrification Administration
to enable it to build 366 miles of
line to serve its 1 271 members Other
R E A -aided organizations have women
on their boards of directors but
this is the first one to have a woman
as executive head 
According to a news article in last
week s Cooperative Builder the
Chinese government is at work organizing
30 000 Cooperative enterprises
in central and western China It
seems that the Japanese has captured
or destroyed many of China s manufacturing
and industrial centers and
the government is organizing small
cooperative units to replace their loss 
Producer consumer and credit Coops
are the principal types of cooperatives
being established T Otto Nall 
writing in the Classmate suggests
that if Japan were really sincere
about helping the Chinese as they
claim they are they might send Kagawa
to China to help organize the
Cooperatives

We had our last meeting o f the
Home Makers leaders meeting April
15 at B R Falls at the court house
with Margaret McCordic We were
taught a great many valuable lessons
on housecleaning and told how to
make things such as wallpaper cleaner 
silver polish etc to help save and
keep down expenses 
Methods o f housecleaning have
changed considerably in the last few
years In times past women set fu rniture
out in the yard and on the
porches curtains went down and the
house generally upset for so many
days that not only the home maker
herself but her entire family were
worn out When the home maker gets
so tired that her nerves are upset 
the whole family suffers from her irritation
and fatigue and the conditions
are generally uphappy 
Newer methods of house cleaning
are not so disturbing The home
maker organizes her work before she
begins and handles first the problems
that will disconcert her family least 
For instance she may clean attic and
basement without changing the other
rooms o f the house at all Then closets
and cupboards may be cleaned
and reorganized The curtains may
be cleaned or renovated and rolled
up ready to put up when the rooms
are cleaned She will do them best
when she is not tired out with the
heavier work and what a joy to have
them all ready to put up after the
room is cleaned 
Every house keeper should have a
special closet if possible for cleaning
utensils and cleaners so that she
knows where to find her tools 
We learned so many things at this
meeting that I believe others who do
not belong to the Home Makers club
would like to know of some of these
recipes which I shall put in the B-J
this time I f I get time and may
have space I may put more in the
B-J as time goes on I am sure we
have enough material to pass on to
our club for some time 
One thing ants do not like is kerosene 
Saturate cotton with kerosene
and fill cracks where they come in 
Try and find their hill or nest and
pour a little gasoline or kerosene into
it 
Cockroaches frequent pantries and
kitchens that are not often thoroughly
cleaned They do much o f their
feeding at night or when the place is
dark They multiply very rapidly 
Clean well in cracks and shelves then
sprinkle with sodium fluoride along
the places frequented by the roaches 
P a in t Cleaner
(This is recommended only for
very soiled walls and where an abrasive
is needed)
1 bar of neutral laundry soap
1 quart boiling water
1 14-oz can o f your favorite cleanser
(such as is used for cleaning
sinks bath tubs etc ) or the same
amount o f fine whiting 
1 cup ammonia 
Vt cup cold water
Shave soap and dissolve in the boiling
water Add cleanser or whiting 
Beat with a rotary egg beater When
cold add ammonia and cold water 
Mix thoroughly Keep in a tight container 
D ire c tio n i for w a ih in painted walls
or other surface  Use two pans of
warm water one for washing and one
for rinsing Dip a soft cloth into water
and then into the paint cleaner 
Use an up and down stroke in washing
and overlap the strokes to avoid
streaks Wash only a small space at
a time Rinse with clear water Wipe
dry with a clean soft cloth Get fresh
water when necessary A soft brush
is satisfactory for cleaning a rough
surface 
I t is important with this cleaner to
wash only a small space at a time and
to thoroughly rinse immediately 
E E Homstad and R W Boehlke 
o f this city attended the cold storage
locker operator s conference held
at the college of agriculture in Madison 
The conference was attended
by some 75 operators from all parts
o f Wisconsin With the formation of
a state organization o f locker operators
in mind those in attendance appointed
an organizing committee to
draw up plans to present to operators
at a later date

P oultry Hints
What are the things that count in
successful brooding
1 Teach every chick to eat before
coming too hungry Feed by the
time they are at least 48 hours old 
2 Keep the room temperature low
and the brooder temperature high
enough to keep the chicks comfortable 
3 Keep the feed hoppers out on
range and moved to a new location
each day 
A turn of warm weather may mean
coccidiosis troubles At the first sign
of chicks in the lot out of condition
and off feed start a four day program
with a 40 per cent mash that is ^0
pounds of mash and 40 pounds of
dried milk Feed this mixture for
only four days Clean the house relitter
and move to clean range It
helps to clean and relitter the house
each day for the four day period 
I f you have had no sign of coccidia
up to the fifth week use a 30
per cent mash th a t is 70 pounds of
mash an d 30 pounds o f dried m ilk for
a h a lf day once each week from the
f if t h to the tw e lfth week Give the
30 per cent mash in the m orn in g and
the regular mash in the afternoon and
fo r the rest o f the week 
Dried m ilk is rather low in price
this season

P oultry
This week May 8 to 13 is national
egg week P upils in m any rural
schools are ta k in g p art in a poultry
essay contest seeking thereby to call
a tte ntio n to the value o f eggs as a
food and the p a rt they play in b u ild in
g W isconsin s 45 m illio n dollar
p o u ltry business 
Buyers as they go to market find
a variety of color in the egg shells
that are offered ranging from white
through the various tints of brown 
They find that some eggs contain
dark yolks while others are lighter in
color Why the difference
In answer to these and other questions 
J B Hayes extension poultryman
of the College of Agriculture 
explains that a bird with a white ear
lobs produces a white shelled egg 
while those with red ear lobes produce
a brown shelled egg The white
egg may be tinted while the brown
egg may be any shade of brown from
a tint to a dark chocolate - The shell
color may diminish with production 
That is a pullet that produces a tinted
egg may by hatching time produce
a white shelled egg Pullets produced
by a cross between white and
brown egg breeds will lay eggs which
are medium in shell color Although
the eggs will be neither white nor
brown but tinted they are sold as
brown eggs 
These facts should be of interest
to flock owners who sell eggs for a
white egg market Although there is
absolutely no difference in taste between
white and brown shelled eggs 
Hayes observes that the consumer is
often prejudiced either for or against
a certain color For this reason he
suggests that if an egg is sold as
white it should be white and not
just a very light brown 
When it comes to yolk color 
Hayes explains that this is entirely
controlled by feed Feeds rich vitamon
A such as yellow corn green
pasture and alfalfa increase the yolk
color While it is possible it is impractical
to attempt to produce a
yolk color that resembles the color
of the albumen 
Where eggs must be sold on a market
where one shellcolor may obtain
a premium over another care should
be observed in crossing the breeds 
Tinted white eggs should not be used
for hatching males from females that
produce tinted white eggs 
1939 Soil Program
Indicating their intention of taking
part in the 1939 soil conservation
program 2293 Jackson county farmers
had completed and signed individual
farm plans up to the final date 
Monday May 1 This total number of
signers represents 93 per cent of all
farms and covers 96 6 percent of the
total crop land in the county In 1938
approximately 2233 or 90 per cent of
the farmers of this county actually
participated in the program 
At a district meeting held at La
Crosse on Wednesday May 2rd H O 
Wells chairman of the State Committee 
announced that the 1939 compliance
check up work will be done
during the month of June Township
committeemen will be asked to check

by Smoke Signal Red Cloud
 Andy Kuhn has in the past given
the theatre-goers many a treat in the
way of movies but he was three
jumps ahead of himself when he presented
 Dodge City In one of the
episodes when the Yankee element
were singing a battle hymn o f the
north and the people from the south
began singing Dixie it was then I
found out there was a stranger in the
theatre whether he or she was from
Minnesota or Illinois I could not say
because you know it was pitch dark
inside 
The lilting music of the song fest
being so infectious I nudged my partner
and we being in the spirit o f the
thing began singing On Wisconsin 
when b in g! something round and
hard hit me on the tip of the ear
and at the same time my partner said
 Ouch ! The little pellet turned out
to be a cough drop Yep! There
was a foreigner there alright 
The father came back home from
a fishing trip wearing a black-tipped
yellow feather in his hat The inquisitive
young son wanted to know where
his dad got the feather He was told
it came from a squirred Non-plus
sed the young son shot right back 
 Oh from a flying squirrel eh The
moral Nowadays you can t kid the
youngsters and get by with it 
The blueberry vines are blossom
ing and so are June berry bushes
and the wild cherry trees I t s all up
to Jack Frost now whether we will
have a good crop of wild fruit 
The woodlands are now veritable
paradise of flowers It will do a person
a world of good to take a little
stroll thru the woods Not even at
the world s fair would a person see
anything so wonderful and so beautifu
l as the flowers we see right here
in our own Wisconsin 
Something in the way of novelty
car license came to my notice just
lately A party ordered 1 50 worth

we need it or not and still be able
to whistle while doing it

As 12 noon Tuesday the farmhouse
occupied by Robert Staples and
family caught fire from a spark from
the chimney and in just one-half hour
the house was burned completely to
the ground The Staples family lost
practically everything and they had
no insurance Many folks from town
went up to the fire but it was such a
hot one and a high wind that no one
could get near the building The
house was located on the former Zatechka
farm The farm and building
were owned by Iowa parties

Burton Smith was near Neillsville
several days ago and purchased an
old unused street car and has had it
hauled to his vacant lot on Main
street the former Eid lot and is getting
it ready for occupancy Just
what his relic will house is not definitely
known as he may move his
shoe repair business over or he may
convert it into a lunch room or he
may sell it Anyhow there is a good
deal o f comment as to why such a
piece o f old iron was allowed to be
placed on Main street but that s Mr 
Smith s business and his alone A fter
it has been painted etc it may be a
 thing of beauty and fill a long felt
want on the boulevard There are
a lot of old street cars and railroad
cars that have been put along the
side o f our highways in the state and
they have been made into some fine
lunch rooms When Mr Smith gets
the hole filled in and some grass
seed planted it might not look so bad
after all 
Mrs Olive Blencoe returned on the
bus Tuesday morning from a two
weeks visit at the home of Mr and
Mrs James McHugh in Minneapolis 
Mrs McHugh who suffered a slight
stroke last November is improving
daily and hopes that by the aid of
the hot summer air to become fully
recovered from her illness Her sister
Hattie has been with her more
or less all the time since she became
ill Her many Merrillan friends are
all trusting that she will completely
recover her health soon 
Clifford Christianson has not been
feeling well lately and was taken to
the hospital last week for some x-ray
pictures and came home in the early
evening of the same day His troubles
were some liver ailments and a
stoppage of the bowels which have
improved since treatment

a sheet of music

Sorry folks but the statement
made in this column last week was

will be the regular exhibit In other
words we will have both

Congress will not adjourn by June
15th A few months ago talk of early
adjournment was popular and such
predictions were numerous Now
there are fewer predictions and fa r
more uncertainty as to when the session
may close The Senate voted
down overwhelmingly a resolution fixing
a date in June Its author advocated
the rushing o f appropriation
bills the postponement of other legislation 
and closing the session to
give the country a rest He thought
such a course might help business
pick up Perhaps it would A fter all
the rest o f the endeavors made to
help business pick up the suggested
experiment relatively might be less
expensive But congress still has
enough work before it to last for
weeks and there is more being poured
into the hopper daily 
There is a large element in Congress
which does not want adjournment
with the threat o f a foreign war
impending and it is saying so The
argument is offered that should war
occur the responsibility o f keeping
our country out of it should be shared
by congress Nobody has offered any
good reason why our country should
become involved whether or not congress
remains in session And even if
it remains for months there is little
present prospect that it will enact
any neutrality legislation which will
prevent our becoming involved in the
usual way first our money next
o ur men 
The effect o f the war fever abroad
upon congress as well as upon other
many people is evidenced by the
swelling accounts for expenditures 
Project previously rejected by congress
as unnecessary come to the
front as essential in case war occurs 
When the total of all appropriations
for the session is arrived at the
amounts for war preparations will be
surprising A fter lavish expenditures
for national defense the past twenty
years the inadequacy o f results
is rather astonishing The Army and
Navy funds probably will exceed the
size o f relief funds The ground work
is being laid for future expenditures
which will be even larger O ur unbalanced
budget is not being relieved 
notwithstanding the economies effected
in minor matters A borrowed dollar
expended for gun-powder weighs
as much as one borrowed to buy bread
and milk for the relief rolls 
The Florida ship canal project 
strongly defeated in two previous sessions
is again to the fore This time
it is being urged as a war necessity 
Prominent naval officials who protested
previously that it would not be of
much service for war purposes suddenly
change front and claim it would
be of great strategic value I t would
cost 200 000 000 I t would not be
completed for ten years or more I f
war is imminent it would be of no
advantage And i f war is not probable
fo r another ten years why dig a big
ditch across Florida in anticipation o f
its future usefulness 
The Panama Canal is coming in for
more money and more attention
also Built for war purposes as well
as for those o f peace it looms large
in appropriation bills The cost o f its
defense far exceeds the cost o f its
upkeep It has been fortified ever
since it was completed but it will be
even better protected as thirty millions
more are expended from this
year s appropriations Still pending
are recommendations for an additional
 221 000 000 to be spent upon
new canal locks to accommodate the
bigger and better battleships now
building Then will come the fortifica
tion o f Porto Rico and new naval
bases in the Carribean and the Pacific
to further protect this important
connecting link between the two
oceans should war come One must
wonder what war would cost i f pre
parations for it must run into b ill
ions 
The president o f Nicaraugua is in
town a guest of our own government 
He was met at the railway station by
an assemblage of dignitaries a troop
of cavalry and the usual sort o f reception
committee which is common
to the welcoming of such prominent
official visitors He will be well-entertained
and impressed with the good
neighbor attitude of our big country
toward his little country He will return
home well-pleased of course but
possibly even more gratified by the
pledges of new advantages which may
flow from our shores to those o f his
own land O fficial visitors as a rule
come for practical as well as social
purposes 
Recently the Brazilian foreign
minister came He was gracious and
smiling described as a delightful
person and he had a grand time as
he further cemented the feeling of
good-will between the two countries 
As an incident of his visit Brazil ob
tained a further credit slip in the
amount of 100 000 000 Part o f it
will be used in paying for a few warships
which Brazil is having built in
Europe The present default in Brazilian
securities held in our country
amounts to 241 000 000 plus unpaid
interest Our country s exports to
Brazil last year amountd to 64 -
000 000 
Nicaraugua believes in wanting
more than Brazil It wants a new
ocean canal at a cost o f 500 or 600
millions of dollars There are interests
in our country which also want
it some for the profits of construction 
and others for the profits of
their shipping lines Some high naval
officials believe another canal between
the oceans might be handy in
case of war hence the timely visit
of the Nicarauguan president It does
not seem likely that congress will take
steps toward the Nicaraugua canal at
this time It may require several such
presidential visits before the propaganda
swells to important proportions 
In the meantime there will be
opportunity for the people to observe
that it is not alone the cost of a
canal that counts but also the cost of
its defense MERLIN HULL

Sod hump dams and sod flumes
have proved effective in controlling
shallow gullies with small watersheds 
according to V Schroeder engineer
of the Irving CCC camp 
Applicable only in shallow gullies
with small watersheds sod hump
dams are built to restore natural waterways 
the engineer said The dams
are small earth fills covered with bluegrass
sod and built across the gully 
When more than one dam is constructed
in the same gully they are
so placed that the lower dam ponds
water to the foot of the dam above 
Silt carried by run-off water from
fields above is deposited behind each
dam until eventually the gully is filled
and a sodded waterway is established 
The construction o f sod flumes
consists of sloping raw gully heads
and laying strips of sod over the sloped
part in such a manner that runoff
water can safely flow over the
head of the gully without causing
erosion 
The effectiveness o f sod hump dams
and sod flumes in controlling fully
erosion may be seen from the demonstrations
applied on the farms of H arley

Riddance of the debris left by the
passing o f winter has been a major
job which this year has reached such
proportions that nearly every city has
organized a war on dirt by organization
and concerted action along many
fronts April 29 to May 6 has been
designated by the National Junio r
Chamber o f Commerce as Clean-up
and Paint-up week and all units of
this group have taken up the battle
cry by conducting the week in their
local communities 
Every locality regardless of size
should take part in this laudable enterprise 
The pride of a clean home 
clean yard clean streets and parks
should be in the heart of every citizen 
This is the time o f year when
inventory should be taken of your
personal properties and those community
properties Winter is over
and summer is near at hand Let us
spruce-up paint-up build-up cleanup 
plant-up and fix-up 
One of the greatest benefits that
comes from clean-up week is the discovery
and removal o f fire hazards 
Each year an unnecessary toll o f millions
of dollars is taken because of
carelessness Much of this waste can
be avoided by cleaning our homes and
discovering these hazards before it is
too late

A jack-of-all-trades in cookery is
the ordinary egg 
Eggs may do any one of many d ifferent
things Some o f the reasons
for their reputation for versatility are
given by Miss Charlotte Clark University
of Wisconsin extension n utritionist 
They may serve as a main protein
dish at a meal thicken a custard assist
in leavening by holding air in an
angel food cake They emulsify as in
mayonnaise bind meat loaf coat croquettes 
and clarify soup and coffee 
And they are used as a color in boiled
salad dressing flavor in sponge
cake and garnish for salads and
greens 
Egg whites are commonly used for
meringues There are hard and soft
meringues Miss Clark points out 
Soft meringues are used on pies while
the hard ones are baked and served
as a dessert usually with the addition
of fruit and whipped cream 
Miss Clark suggests that egg whites
are more easily separated from yolks
when the eggs are cold But egg
whites at room temperature beat up
more quickly and to a larger volume
than cold ones A small amount of
salt is usually added to egg whites to
aid in increasing foaming and stiffness 
the nutritionist has found 
Twice as much sugar is used in the
hard meringues as in the soft ones 
Mr and Mrs Wm Kluth of Rockford

father C M Smith formerly of

guests at the home o f Mrs W ill Kluth
senior Mr Kluth has been on the
road 20 years as a salesman for an
oil company and is planning to retire
from that work He recently sold his
home in Rockford Through F J 
Bowman s agency Mr Kluth has purchased
from Frank Merrill and his
sister Mrs Ed Bopp of Alma Center 
a 17-acre farm located one-half mile
east of Alma Center It is an ideal
farm for berry culture and poultry 
all under cultivation has two acres
in strawberries and one-half acre in
asparagus the latter now being harvested
and is a bountiful crop Mr 
Kluth will remodel and improve the
dwelling house immediately and erect
other buildings It will make a lovely
home for Mr and Mrs Kluth and Mr 
Smith Their many friends and relatives
are rejoicing to have these former
Jackson county people return
here and settle in our midst and wish
them unbounded success in their new
undertaking

Well spring seems to have really
arrived at last after staying away so
long that we were looking at the calendar
with despair The warm sunny
days produce such a fever o f activity
that work seems to get done
in h alf the time and new tasks
beckon from every side The farmer
gets out plow and tractor and seeder 
and digs into his fields the housewife
throws open doors and windows
and digs into comers the babies wiggle
bare toes appreciatively in the
warm sun and dig in sandpiles the
fishermen hopefully dig worms and
everybody who has a square foot of
earth digs in the garden Everywhere
there are lazy puffs o f smoke rising
from piles of burning leaves and
trash and the whole world seems to
come alive and throw off the lassitude
of winter Drouth and grasshoppers
and crop failures may come later but
just now everything looks grand and
we are certain this will be the best
season yet August may bring despair 
but A pril and Spring bring
hopefulness

Are you a sucker for contests too
I am always writing slogans or testimonials
or last lines in the vain
hope that some day I ll be the lucky
winner It sounds so deceptively easy
to win a Buick or a Chevrolet or
 1 000 or an electric mixer or a
dozen other thin g s so one more sale
is made by the company in question 
and I spend the next few weeks in a
daze of planning what to do with my
trophies So fa r I have just one
honorable mention and that much to
my astonishment was a set o f fine
pictures o f cows Contesting is an
insidious disease You have an attack
and then the symptoms abate
somewhat Immediately you read in
the paper or hear over the radio an
interview with some lucky winner 
and the rash breaks out all over
again Or a new magazine displays
a picture of something you are just
dying to own and off you go! My
case is so chronic that I just automatically
cut off the tops o f boxes
and save soap wrappers and tuck
them away hopefully until the next
contest comes along A foolish business 
no doubt but somebody has to
win and it might be me!
