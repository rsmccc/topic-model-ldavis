FORTY-SEVENTH YEAR WITTENBERG. SHAWANO COUNTY. WISCONSIN. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 21. 1939 NUMBER 6
|CHURCH IS PACKED FOR
IMPRESSIVE SERVICES
Property Tax Adjustment
Highway privilege taxes paid this
week to towns, villages and cities of
the state are in reality an adjustment
to municipalities for levies formerly
collected as a personal property tax
on automobiles.
Prior to 1933 and the boosting of
the gasoline tax from 2 to 4 cents per
gallon local units of government collected
fees from automobile owners as
a personal property tax. With the
raising of the gasoline tax the personal
property tax on motor vehicles
was abolished and the highway privilege
tax adjustment created.
Highway tax checks are apportioned
to local units on a basis of automobile
registrations in the locality.
Twenty per cent of the registration
fee collected from a governmental unit
is returned to that unit. However, if
the 20 per cent figure is lower than
the amount collected during 1932
through property tax then the latter
figure is used.
Highway privilege taxes this year
amounted to $3,705,000. State treasury
checks were issued for one half
this amount. Other payments will be
made in January and February.
Protest Bang's Cut
The state board of agriculture has
adopted a resolution which asks the
state emergency board to restore the
fu ll appropriations for the eradication
of Bang’s disease and bovine tuberculosis
in the state.
The reductions were $25,000 for the
present fiscal year out of the $250,000
annual appropriation made by tbe
1939 legislature for Bang’s disease
control and $21,186 out of the $228,000
appropriated for the same period for
bovine tuberculosis control.
The resolution said appropriations
were inadequate before the reductions
were made. W’hile the board did not
object to cutting the department to
the extent of $64,000 for department
administration, it protested the cut of
more than $46,000 for paying fa rm e r
for cattle losses sustained under the
disease control program.
New Prison Rules
Wisconsin’s new department of public
welfare gave its attention to the inmates
of Waupun state prison and tin
problem of the released prisoner wh-n
it announced the abolishment of the
silent system and the hair clipping
rule in the prison and the establishment
of a camp fo r discharged and
released prisoners until work can be
found for them.
_Also changed was the visiting rule
at the prison. Hereafter, announced
Department Director Frank C. Klode,
sightseers, tourists or others having
no real interest in the prison or in
public welfare problems will not be
given permission to go through the institution.
Klode pointed out that the
prison has occasionally had over 200
visitors a day. many of whom officials
knew nothing about. In the future
visiting will be restricted to friends,
relatives, or attorneys of inmates, and
school and civic groups who have made
arrangements for their visits in ad
vance.
The silent system, which has been
in effect in the dormitories, cell blocks
and the dining room, has been abolished
and the prisoners will hereafter be
permitted to converse with each other
in low tones. The practice of clipping
off all the hair of new inmates, formerly
necessary as a sanitary measure
but which has been a humiliating
custom, has also been adopted.
Boy Scouts
Scouts have been busy mending and
painting toys as their Christmas Good
Turn. The Lions Club is sponsoring
this project and are paying for the
material used.
The boys will distribute baskets of
food provided by the Lions Club and
the toys on Saturday afternoon.

SCHOOL NEWS
Birnamwood Upsets Wittenberg 24-22
In a basketball game at Birnamwood
last Friday night the local cagers
lost their first conference game. It
was a defeat that was hard to take
because the losers showed such superiority
during the first half that they
held a 15-7 lead gained by controlling
the ball and penetrating the Birnamwood
defense almost at will while
their opponents appeared helpless.
The second half was different. The
boys in white were apparently confident
that the game was theirs and
showed a lack of form and resorted to
long shots that gave Birnamwood a
chance to pick up loose balls and put
them through the net. Playing smart
and alert ball combined with a few
long shots they earned the prized victory
in the last minute of play.
The Wittenb?r£ team had a large
following which appeared stunned at
the outcome but took it in a calm and
sportsmanlike way. The boys are now
on the spot and will have an up hill
fight to get back ori top in the conference
race and a defeat at the hands of
Tigerton tomorrow night will practically
eliminate them. They will be expected
to win as they have what it
takes if they only use it properly.
In a preliminary at Birnamwood the
Wittenberg grades lost 11-8. They
will also play at Tigerton tomorrow
night.

Under this arrangement Mrs. George
Anderson, who has filled the office of
local librarian in a capable manner
for several years, has been replaced
by Mrs. Robert Johnson (nee Mosling),
of Pulcifer, who took over her new
duties on December 9. She and h e r:

WASHINGTON.—In a recent poll
of Washington correspondents by
Newsweek it was disclosed that •
heavy m ajo rity of the news writers
in the cap ital think that President
Roosevelt w ill be renominated, and
that Sen. A rthur H. Vandenberg of
Michigan w ill be the Republican
nominee.
The poll was confidential as to
the views of any individual correspondent.
So that the writer for the
most partisan Republican organ
could express his view freely that
Roosevelt would be nominated and
elected, whereas the correspondent
for the D aily Worker could pred'ct
the nomination of John Nance C. rner
by the Democrats, and cf Jam es
j W. Wadsworth by the Republicans if
j that is what he wanted to say. There
would be no repercussions.
This makes the poll a most inter-
| esting topic for conversation, and
I presumably a (air cross sect.on of
the views of the men whose occupation
it is to be expert observers.
Anyway they are being paid for it.
Furthermore, this writer takes no
exception to the list of correspondents
selected by Newsweek for this
poll. He is rather effectively barred
from such criticism because he was
one of those polled!
Yet the odds of the only bets the
writer has heard about as to the
nomination of Roosevelt for a third
term are three to one against!
Whereas, it is almost impossible to
conceive events between now and
next Ju ly which will make Senator
Vandenberg's stand against repeal
of the arm s embargo in the extra
session helpful to his chances.
Actually the writer agrees with
the m ajo rity of correspondents
polled that the nomination of Roosevelt
by the next Democratic convention
is likely, despite the third-term
issue. Yet there is no denying that
most recent indications, especially
the swing of the left wing New Dealers
to P a u l V. McNutt, are to the
contrary.
Convention Situation
Mi th t Force Roosevelt
The question is whether the convention
situation will not be such
that Roosevelt will have to take the
nomination himself, or see it go to
some candidate who might not carry
on the New Deal policies. The
“ smart money" is apparently on the
side of his stepping down. But some
of that “ smart money” is known to
be G am e r money, and this writer
is far from being alone in saying
that if it is to be Garner or a third
term, Roosevelt would go for the
third term.
As to Vandenberg, there ls no
doubt that personally he is better
known and liked by the Washington
correspondents polled than any other
candidate. Personally, the writer
agrees again, but the cold logic
would indicate that at least three
men have * better chance. These
are Thomas E Dewey of New
York, Gov. John W. Bricker of Ohio,
and Sen. Robert A. Taft of Ohio.
At the present moment—subject
to change without notice, downtown
New York is for Bricker, and, probably
unalterably, strongly against
Dewey. This is something to be
reckoned with, for downtown New
York is very potent in two ways.
I t ’s where the big campaign contributions
come from, and socially it
ramifies through the country.
Big frogs from hinterland little
pools are impressed beyond all
rhyme and reason when little frogs
in the New York pool confide their
political opinions. And when the lady
frogs -in New York em it words of
political wisdom, sound or unsound,
it has an even greater effect on the
lady frogs from the hinterland pools.
V. S. Gold-Buying Power
Seen as War Preventive
Use of this nation's gold-buying
power m ig h t have stopped Soviet
aggression on Finland in its tracks
[ if a suggestion recently made to
President Roosevelt by an internationally
known financial authority
had worked out according to his
formula.
It was based on the fact that the
Soviet produces a very large portion
of all the gold that the United
States treasury is buying from the
rest of the world. Actually Russia
stands second in the list, with the
British empire first, but Russia has
been gaining and hopes to becomc
No. 1 gold producer before long.
But the only purchaser for this
gold, running well into the hundreds
of millions of dollars, is Uncle Sam.
He pays $35 an ounce for it. Nobody
else, practically, is buying any.
The proposal of this expert was
that President Roosevelt, with no
fanfare of publicity so that the Soviet
authorities would be em b arrassed,
let the Stalin government
know that it the Soviet governm
ent attacked F inland this governm
ent would stop buying gold from
the Soviet.
Not only that, but this government
would serve notice on all the other
governments in the world, including
especially Ja p a n and the nations now
supplying Russia with war m aterials,
Oiat if they took any Russian
gold in payment for their products,
or in any other way. the United
States would no longer buy gold
from them.
The expert in question is absolutely
confident that, it this had been
done, Stalin would not have dared
proceed against Finland. He point*
out that there m igh t be some embarrassing
consequences, in that the
net result m igh t be to freeze gold,
and thus add another handicap to
world trade. But this, he insists,
would be worth the cost.
Scheme W ould Not Cost
V. S. Government a Dollar
One attractive part of the scheme,
he explains, is that it would not cost
the United States government a dollar
or the risk of one life. All it
would cost would be such exports as |
this country is now able to make to I
Russia, and for which Russia is
paying in gold. This country could
still sell to Soviet buyers all that
they could pay for in goods. The
only complication would be that it
would no longer take gold.
The worst complication about the
plan is that it would require considerable
scrutiny to prevent any Russian
gold finding its way into our
hands and yet at the same time not
interfere with the British selling us
all the gold they could produce.
While there is no disposition to
change the present gold policy, under
which the United States, alone
and virtually unaided, is pegging the
price of gold at $35 an ounce, even
if it were suddenly decided that
this program should be abandoned,
it would not be stopped until after
the present war is over.
This is the flrst time that any suggestion
has been made to use the
enormous subsidy power of this gold
buying to coerce other nations into
a line of conduct which the United
States could approve.
Government Agencies i n
Drive Against Utilities
The anti-utility drive is under way
again. A gullible reporter in Washington
will be told by all sorts of
public power functionaries that it
doesn't mean a thing—that it was a
pure coincidence that Dave Lilienthal,
John Carmody, Jo h n Rankin,
George Norris and Harold Ickes have
been laying down a barrage against
the electric companies. No one in
high command, it is asserted by the
underlings, pressed any button that
ended the truce which m any neutrals
had hoped would work a permanent
peace.
But it does not take a very cynical
m ind to conclude that there are just
too many individual actions, and im pending
actions, and that they all
fit together too precisely into a pattern,
for the whole conglomeration
to be banditry instead of an organized
m ilitary operation. The tim ing,
also, is important. It came
on the eve of the final date for " in tegration”
of the holding companies
under the death sentence, being administered
now by Jerom e F rank of
SEC. It comes just a few weeks
before the scheduled beginning of
the monopoly committee’s probe
into investment trusts tied up with
the utilities. F rom this last, incidentally,
the utility baiters hope for
great publicity from the big names
associated in the public m ind with
Wall street which they expect will
be flashed on the front pages of
every newspaper in the country.
The strategy is even clearer when j
one realizes that the new cpngress
will meet in Ja n u d ty—right after j
the public has been thoroughly shellshocked
by, first, the wickedness
of the power barons, via the T. N.
E . C. investigation, and, second, the
shameful unpreparedness from a
m ilitary standpoint, as Mr. Ickes'
lieutenants assure him will be demonstrated.

Colossal Shifting of
Business Equities Planned
SE C is guarding its strategy with
a secrecy so intense that one wonders
if anybody except Jerome

its plan, which, it is admitted, will
shortly be sprung and involves a
forced "integratio n” system which
will be the most colossal shifting of
business equities in history.
T. N. E. C .’s plans are fairly obvious,
aimed only at whipping John

public power group wants from congress.
But there is a curious Indecision
in the general staff of the anti-utility
forces as to what to ask congress to
do— how to cash in quickly on all
this tremendous barrage and drive
the country further down the road
of complete socialism in the electric
industry. As a m atter of fact, there
are a few pinks among the reds.
The pinks would leave all existing
steam operations in private hands,
only insisting that all hydroelectric
power should be public.
But the indecision is caused by
lack of conviction that congress will
be as amenable as when it was

worrying the public power group is
the coal industry, not only the mine

RUMANIA FIGHTS O F F E N EM IE S AND PROTECTORS*
Chances grew this month that pressure un Rum ania from a ll sules may drive
Europe's ua r into the Balkans, where a precarious peace still clings hopefully. Im m e diate
sources of trouble are shoun above. Not shown are lonner-standing sources,
namely, pressure on Humania from Germany, on the one hantl, and Britain and France
on the other. Both want control of R um an ian oil and grain, but so, for that matter, do
Russia and Italy. One Soviet step inside Rumania, however, would bring down the
wrath of Italy, which demands that the Balkans be left severely alone.
D O M E S T I C :
America Abroad
There may have been some
marked connection between U. S.
politics and the state department's
abrupt decision to censure Europe's
belligerents. Then, again. Ambassador
Joseph P. Kennedy's return
from London may have provided
impetus. But while Republican
strategist* were debating the wisdom
of attacking the administration's
alleged pro-British stand and
its failure to rebuke Russia for invading
Finland. Secretary of State
Cordell Hull acted swiftly.
Russia was warned the U. S. would
hold Moscow responsible for d am ages
to American interests growing
out of its blockade of Finland. Since
Americans are already barred from
this area by the neutrality law, the
warning was at best a slight wrist
*lap. Next Mr. Hull warned Britain
that her new blockade of German

It was no picnic for the Reds, at
any rate. Inexperienced in arctic
warfare, they died by the hundreds
as the Finns loosed snow avalanche*,
disabled scores of tanks with uncanny
firing accuracy and rode to
victory on skis against their ill-prepared
adversaries.
But the Finns were weakening,
outfought by force of sheer Soviet
manpower. In desperation, Vlinoe
Hakkila, speaker of the Finnish diet,
appealed by radio: " . . . We believe
the civilized world, which has
given us testament of its great sympathy,
will not leave us to flght
alone . . .“
Western War
Peace talk to the contrary, the allies’
war against Germany became
intensified as Britain clamped down
her blockade of all Nasi exports.
A Japanese freighter, which stubbornly
threatened to sail with German
goods from the Netherlands,
suddenly changed its mind. On one
“ black F rid ay” 14 losses to British
and neutral nations were revealed,
plus alleged sinking of three Nazi
U-boats.

exports “ shall not cause interference
with the legitimate trade of its
(Am erica’s) nationals . . . ”
Joe Kennedy's hand was more visible
in the next move. President
Roosevelt told his press conference
the ways were being sought to increase
the use of American ships on
routes abandoned by the British and
other belligerents.
Climaxing the renewal of vigorous
U. S. action abroad was establishment
of a dumm y Finnish-American
Trading corporation, to be financed
by $10,000,000 in credits supplied by
Jesse Jones' export-import bank.
T H E W A R S :
Rum o r Hath It—
A persistent but unconfirmed report
popped up simultaneously in a
half-dozen European capitals to the
effect that Germany was willing to
call off her war with the allies, joining
hands in a four-power (France,
Britain, Italy and Germany) drive
against the Russian juggernaut. Nobody
doubted Nazi interest in such
a project, because Germany dislikes
the Russians. Nor did many observers
doubt that this must eventually
happen if the Soviet is to be
held in check. But it was equally
•vident that until Russia pounds on
their doors, the allies will continue
their "holy war” against Hitlerism.
Arctic War
Whether they were spreading
propaganda or telling the truth, the
F inns did a nice job ot building up
world hatred of the Soviets. One
report said they were sending Polish
peasants across the heavily-mined

ascended the rostrum to open the
league's greatest show—the trial
of Russia for an attempt on F inland's
life. Italy was gone; so was
Germany. The Russian delegate,
Jakob Surits, stayed at his hotel.
This left the league largely a
group of democracies bound together
in a last futile attempt to m aintain
peace by collective security.

This drew the allies into line. Scandinavia,
its security threatened by

CH APT ER X V II I—Continued.
— 16—
Norwood drew rein beneath the
baobab tendril. He did n 't even have
to stand in the saddle to reach it.
The sais rode forward and took the
reins. Norwood climbed the tendril,
hand over hand, swung himself on
to the wall, and walked forward.
As he emerged out of the shadow
of the overhanging trees, he saw
O'Leary looking backward toward
him . Norwood extended both arms
and moved them slightly up and
down. That was an order to O'Leary
to patrol the road. Norwood wanted
no witnesses. He walked forward
along the wall, toward the
kiosk, where R und h ia stood talking
to Lynn.
Lynn saw h im flrst. She looked
startled and Rundhia faced about—
for a moment speechless.
“ You, is i t ! " he said. “ What the
devil do you mean, climbing walls
at this hour of the n ig ht?"
“ I came looking for you. No, it
isn’t my ghost. They missed me.
Did you hear the shooting? A ren’t
you rather a duffer at choosing
m arksm en?”
“ I don’t know and I don’t care
what you mean by that rem ark,”
said Rundhia. “ Get off the w a ll."
"When I ’m ready. Rundhia, what
have you been saying about m e ?”
“ You flatter yourself. I don’t care
to talk about you.”
“What did you say to the Resident?
He mentioned that you had
called to see h im ."
“ Did he? Well, m y conversation
with the Resident was confidential.”
“ So was mine, Rundhia. Say to
me what you said to h im .”
“ You may go to the devil.” Rundhia
glanced backward at Lynn,
then sneered at Norwood: "People
who pocket bribes are not entitled
to—”
It wasn’t exactly a haymaker. It
was a right-handed wallop without
any ringside pedigree, but with all
the strength, contempt and anger of
• clean-living m an behind it, that
landed on R undhia's chin like a gun
going off. It brought a laugh from
O'Leary, who couldn't possibly
have seen it. Rundhia reeled backward
toward the garden as if poleaxed.
out for the count. He did a
forward knife-bend on the edge of
the wall, and toppled backward into
the darkness. The crash of shrubbery
announced that he had fallen
•oft. Norwood glanced at Lynn then:
“ Ju s t a minute, please.”
He ran down the steps to take a
look at Rundhia and dragged him
out of the shrubbery on to the path.
He made a rough estimate that no
bones were broken and let him lie
there. He returned up the steps
and confronted Lynn.
" I suppose you’ve killed h im .”
•■Oh, no.”
They could see each other almost
a i distinctly as in full daylight.
L y n n 'i hair was a mass of spun
gold. Her emotions, revealed on
her face, her parted lips, her startled,
questioning, proud eyes drove
out of Norwood’s m ind the few terse
phrases that he had prepared. He
said suddenly, because he couldn't
think of anything else to say:
"W h at are you doing in that
make-up?”
"Y o u should have hit m e ,” Lynn
answered. “ That was a cowardly
blow. You gave h im no warning.
Are you sure you haven't killed
h im ? ”
“ I ’m afraid he’ll live. Is it true,
Misa Harding, that you told Rundhia
about a packet of diamonds that you
saw drop from m y pocket this morning
?”
“ Yes.”
Norwood stared at her. She didn't
flinch. She continued speaking after
• moment:
“ That is why I wrote inviting you
to come and see me. I wanted to
tell you what I had done, and to explain
how I came to do it, and to
apologize.”
“ I did n 't believe you had said it,”
Norwood answered. " I came to— ”
Lynn interrupted: “ I did say it.
It was my fault. I wish you had hit
me, instead of Rundhia. I would
have preferred that to the h um iliation
of being despised and of being—”
Rundhia moaned on the path in
the darkness below.
"C aptain Norwood, I must go and
help Rundhia. Will you please let
m e pass?”
“ No,” said Norwood. " I will shout
for servants presently, to carry him
to b ed."
“ His nose m ay be bleeding!”
“ Serve him right. I cam * to tell
you—”
" I can’t bear to be told. 1 know.
You're too late, Captain Norwood.
I have heard that what I said has
got you into serious trouble. I am
•sh am e d of it, if that is what you
w ant to know. If you had read
m y—”
Norwood interrupted her. “ What
do you mean by too late?”
" U you had answered m y letter—”
L y n n ’i lips were trembling. She
was choking. “ Ru nd h ia—”
She couldn’t continue. She felt
Mk« crying. Suddenly ah* controlled
herself and looked straight in hi*
eye*:
“ Captain Norwood. If you please.
I must go and look after Rundhia.
Will you let me get b y ?”
Norwood didn't move: "W h at did
you say in your le tte r?" he asked.
" I f you despised me too much to
read it, why ask that now? I know
you got the letter. It was sent by
one of the Maharanee's messengers,
who came back and said he had
given it to you. He said you tore
it up; he saw you do it."
"D id the messenger tell you
th a t? "
“ He told R undhia.”
" O h ," said Norwood.
O ’Leary whistled, in the distance,
somewhere between the kiosk and
the palace front gate. Rundhia
groaned again. By the noise, he
appeared to be helping himself to
his feet by holding on to the shrubbery.
Norwood called to him :
“ Are you all right, R u n d h ia ?”
"None of your business!” said
Rundhia’s voice from the darkness.
" I ’m going to have you arrested.”
Rundhia's footsteps went staggering
away in the direction of the palace.
Norwood faced Lynn again: "Sorry.
I ’m in a hurry. Would you
like me to see you as far as the
palace steps?”
"O h , no. Thank you.”
“ Well, look here: I wrote you a
letter, just in case I d id n’t find you.
Lynn interrupted: “ I did say it.”
I brought it with me. Will you take
it now and read it later? It's quite
important. Perhaps you’ll give me
an answer next time we meet.”
" I f we do meet,” Lynn answered.
"W h y should we? Good-by.”
“ So long. Don’t forget m y letter,
will you? I d idn’t expect to find you
alone, so I wrote what I thought you
wouldn’t care to have me say in
other people's presence. I said exactly
what I think.”
Lynn paused on her way to the
head of the steps. O 'Leary whistled
again, twice this time.
"So long,” Norwood repeated.
"See you as soon as I can.”
Lynn spoke abruptly: "O ne moment,
Captain Norwood. You say
you have said what you think of me
in this letter? I said what I thought
of myself and of you, in my letter
to you. You tore mine up.”
She tore up Norwood's letter. She
scattered its fragments into the
darkness.
"Good-by!”
"C areful down those steps,'
Norwood. “ See you later."
“ W h y?” Lynn answered.
Norwood swung himself down
from the wall, by the baobab tendril.
He swung himself on to his
horse and was off at a gallop.
O'Leary had whistled three times.
That meant "u rg e nt.”
said
CH A PT E R X IX
The horses and their riders were
invisible in the shadow where the
high wall curved away from the
moonlight. O'Leary spoke hoarsely:
"T hat must ha’ been a snorter:'
You could ha’ heard that punch halfway
to Delhi. Who did you h it? ”
“ Mind your own business. Why
did you whistle?"
"Stoddart sent a m an from camp
to overtake you. He gave the message
to me. He said there'd come
a sweeper, running like heil, from
Mrs. Harding in the guesthouse. She
says she has to see you in a hurry,
it's important, and won't you come
fjuick?”
“ What’s become of the sweeper?”
"H e lit out. He said all's quiet at
.he palace.”
"Nothing else new ?"
"N o ."
Norwood thought a second: "Y o u
go to the Residency. Ask to see
the Resident in person. Give your
message to nobody else. Here—
here's my card. Send that in. Ask
tb* Resident to stand by the phoM
■nd expect • call from m a at any
m inute."
“ Do I know anything, if he asks?"
“ No. Look here, O 'Leary: I know
what I ’m going to do, but I don't
know what will happen. You follow
the Resident to the palace. Slip in
through the gate after him and
watch for that Bengali doctor. Hold
him , if you catch him coming out or
going in. When you see me coming
out of the palace, if I hold up my
right hand, let him go. If I hold up
both hands, turn him over to the
gate guard. You've no police power,
remember. So be careful.”
Norwood was off at full gallop,
with the sais hard after him , before
O ’Leary could answer. He
drew rein at the palace gate and
was delayed there for a moment or
two by an argument between the
commander of the gate guard and
an Indian contractor, who had
turned up with a motor truck for
Mrs. Harding’s luggage and a car
for Mrs. Harding. Because Norwood
was in uniform, the contractor
appealed to him :
“ Sir, I am refused admission. Sir,
I have an order from the American
lady, Mrs. Harding, to collect her
luggage and to convey her to the
station. It is a long way and a bad
road. She has already paid me. I
fear we shall not catch the midnight
train unless—"
The commander of the gate guard
drew Norwood aside: " I t is his honor
the Resident’s w ish ," he said
quietly.
“ No business of m in e ," said Norwood.
"M a y I leave m y horses inside
the gate?”
The great gate clanged behind
him. He walked to the guesthouse.
Mrs. Harding was no longer recumbent
on pillows on the chaiie longue.
She seemed even to have partially
recovered from her lameness. She
was seated bolt upright on one of
her trunks, on the garden path, in
front of the veranda door.
“ There’s no understanding you
English,” she remarked. “ Why don’t
you use your title?”
" I haven’t one.”
“ But your brother is an E arl, isn't
he? So you’re an Honorable, aren't
you?”
"T hat is not what you inferred at
our last interview.”
“ Well, I didn’t know who you are.
How could I? I have a letter for you,
from Lynn. But the envelope was
addressed to me. I have thought
it over, and I suppose she must
have put it into the wrong envelope
by mistake, because I have received
no answer to m y letter to
her. Here it is.”
Norwood stepped on to the veranda
to read it by the light from the
window.
"D e a r Captain Norwood,
“ I am feeling ashamed and so
sorry that I hardly know what to
write. Won’t you please call as
soon as you can and let me explain.
I mentioned, without thinking, something
that occurred this morning.
To my horror, I have now learned
that what I said has been repeated,
and that the result may be—I can't
write it! Please, Captain Norwood,
olease believe that what I said was
merely thoughtless; and that what
I have heard about you I refuse to
believe. I know you are an honorable
man. Please help me to undo
my very bad mistake. I will be
waiting for you at the palace. Won't
you call as soon as possible?
Lynn H a rd in g ."
Norwood returned to Mr*. H arding.
'How long have you had th i* ?”
“ Don’t try any of that hoity-toity
arrogance on m e !” she retorted.
“ I'm a Harding, I ’ll have you understand!
I sent a messenger for you

Norwood wa* gone before *h«

the Residency number. Then h*
lowered his voice:

The swiftest birdflight ever recorded
accurately is in the neighborhood
of 175 miles an hour. Ordi«
nary, unhurried flight averages from
20 to 40 miles an hour, according
to the species.
The United States Department of
Agriculture has compiled a complete
record of the measured flight
speeds of North Am erican and E u ropean
birds. The swiftest denizen
of the skies, according to thi* com pendium,
is the California duck
hawk whose speed, measured with a
stop watch from an airplane, was
found to be between 175 and 180
miles an hour. The eagle is relatively
slow. The Department of Agriculture
compiler, found one rather
questionable recorded speed of 120
miles for a golden eagle. Only two
entirely trustworthy records of eagle
speeds were found—one of 30 and
thc other of 60 miles.
Bird speed records more than 20
years old are worthless, the report
explains, because any possible
means of m easurement was quite inaccurate
and some fantastic estimates
were made, ranging up to 5
•or 6 miles a minute. Most such
guesses, and by far the most trustworthy,
were made by hunters. A
hunter, aim ing at a bird m flight,
had to make three subconscious estimates—
the distance of his target,
the speed at which it was moving
in order that he would know how
far ahead to aim and the speed of
his bullet. The skilled marksman
learned to make allowance for these
three factors instinctively, but never
could explain satisfactorily how he
did it. Only one of these elements
of m arksmanship, the velocity of th*
bullet, could be measured accurately.

found recently by experiment that

Cheese Production High—Wisconsin
produced nearly four and onehalf
pounds of every 10 pounds of
Italian cheese made in the nation
last year. The state's 10 Italian
cheese producing counties provided
7,238,000 pounds of the 16,461,000-
pound national total, or 44 per cent.
The highest counties were Fond du
Lac, 2,716,000 pounds; Dodge, 1,»
955,000. and Polk, 1,292,000. The 1038
figure for the state was 25 per cent
higher than that of 1937.
Hog Prices Lower — While cattle
and sheep prices are now higher
than they were a year ago, hog
prices are much lower. Because of
the relatively lower prices of hogs
the index of livestock prices in mid-
November was below the pre-war
level compared with the five per
cent above the 1910-14 average a
year ago. The farm price of hogs as
reported for November 15 was almost

FROM time to time government
officials seek to impose
restrictions on advertising and
make advertisements cold, logical
presentations of technical
buying information. They believe
that logical reasons for
baying would be more productive
than emotional appeals.
In appealing to the emotions
of readers advertising men
are merely taking advantage
of facts that famous writers
and philosophers have known for
centuries. Roamez said, “ Reasons
come afterward, but at first a thing
pleases or shocks me without my
knowing the reason.”
Wilkie Collins, the famous E nglish
novelist, when asked for his
rules for writing successful novels,
said “ Make them
l a u g h , m a k e
them cry, make
them wait.” The
great F r e n c h
writer, De Maupassant,
s a i d ,
“ The public in
general is composed
of numerous
groups who
cry, ‘console me,
amuse me, sadden
me, fill m t with tenderness,
make me laugh, make me tremble,
make me weep, make me think’.”
Some time ago two radio m anufacturers
published full page advertisements
in farm papers. The first
manufacturer devoted his entire advertisement
to telling of the technical
excellences of his product.
The second manufacturer headed
his advertisement, “ Why Do Your
Children Leave the F a rm ? ” , said a
few words about keeping children
at home through entertainment and
finally told about the excellence of
his product. The emotional appeal
produced many times more sales
than the logical reason-why appeal.

I 'MiE American standard of
living is the highest in the
world. One of the most interesting
things about it is the fact
that the public seldom takes
the initiative in demanding new
and improved products. It has
always been a man with a new
idea — something to sell — who
has made the improvements
and offered them to the public
th ro u g h a d v e r tis in g
Gradually the public has accepted
the new idea and a
new standard has been established
from which to start still further improvements.
Our mothers and fathers gladly
accepted crackers scooped out of a
barrel into a paper bag. Then
s o m e o n e conceived
the idea of
crackers boxed in
moisture proof
p a p e r , trademarked
and sold
for five cents a
package. T h e
new idea was advertised,
t h e
public accepted it
and a whole new
industry was created.
This conception of advertising as
the most economical means of offering
a new and better idea to the
public explains many so-called failures
of advertising. Such failures
are due to the fact that advertising
is often used to offer an idea, product
or service that is not interesting
to the public or because the
new idea is not kept before the public
for a long enough period of time
for consumers to thoroughly understand
and appreciate it.
Twenty years ago a large insur
ance company spent a large sum of
money offering a new type of policy.
Results were not satisfactory and
the officers of the company said,
“ Advertising of insurance is a failure
and we will never spend another
penny in advertising.” It was
later learned that the policy offered
in the advertising was not popular
and five years later had completely
disappeared from the insurance
business.

A Warning to the Children:
A TALE O F PETER PIG
By Esther Cooper
Now, Peter Pigr decided
(Though ’twas really very shocking!)
To, leave a greedy little note
Upon his Christmas stocking.
He wrote the note and stuck it
To the stocking with some pins.
It read, in inky letters:
“ Dearest Santa—I am twins.”
“ Hurray! H urray!” cried Peter,
Just so happy he could sing,
“ I f he believes this note—
Why, I ’ll have TWO of everything!”
And then he tip-toed up to bed
As softly as he could,
And lay there looking just as pleased
As if he had been good.
When dawn came, he scampered down.
“ I t ’s Christmas Day,” he thought.
And eagerly, he scurried in
To see what Santa brought.
But when he reached the fireplace
Why, he stopped in blank surprise!
For there, among the presents,
Was another pig his size!
The pig stopped eating candy
And looked up and said, “Hello!”
And Peter cried, “ For goodness sake!
Who’s he? I ’d like to know!”
And just as he was speaking.
Why, his Grandma bustled in.
And smiled, “Why, don’t be bashful!
Say good morning to your twin!”
“My twin!” gasped Peter, feebly,
As he thought of what he wrote.
“I haven’t any twin! I just—
Ju st said so in the note!”
His Grandma nodded sternly.
“I was sure of that,” she said,
“He’s really not a twin—
He is an orphan pig, instead.
“ He had no Christmas dinner—
He’s as poor as poor can be,
And that’s the very reason
That I brought him home with me.
“He w uld have ha'I no lollipops
Nor hooks nor toy nor such—
And you— who have most everything
W ere asking twice as much!”
Then Peter Pig felt so ashamed
His little knees were weak,
“ I ’m sorry now.” he answered,
And a tear rolled down his cheek.
“Don’t cry, my dfar,” his Grandma
said.
“Next, time, you won’t be greedy.
For you will know how nice it s
To share things with the needy.”
So Peter felt quite humble then,
Instead of pleased and smirky,
And when ’twcs dinner time, he let
The orphan carve the turkey.

ganization has been formed in the
South for the purpose of promoting
traffic over the route. The members
got their inspiration from the oganization
in this state and had written for
advice. The highway in Illinois is also
gaining in prominence in that the federal
government is planning on making
Highway 45 through that state a
super-highway.
Resolutions were passed urging the
passage of Joint Res. 32, which would
provide a referendum on the matter of
preventing diversion of highway funds
to other purposes.
Another resolution protests against
the present practice in administering
highway funds and recommending two
courses— either stop diversion or repeal
the four-cent gas tax hack to the
two-cent tax and thus effect a saving
to Wisconsin citizens.
Another resolution cites that some
$30,000,000 of highway funds have
been diverted to other sources which
might otherwise have provided work
for some 5,000 men, and requests the
attorney general to take action to prevent
such diversions, which are contrary
to law.
A resolution was also passed commending
the state highway department
for its part in improving hig hway
45 south of the Langlade county
line. This has done much to increase
traffic over this highway.
There now remains only a small
stretch of highway near the southern
border of the state, the relocating of
a short piece of highway north of
Marion and a portion of the road between
Monico and Three Lakes. The
association is going to continue its
efforts to have these gaps completed
and the entire road improved from one
border of the state to the other. The
slogan: “U. S. Highway 45 Paved by
’45” was adopted.— Antigo Journal.

(See Recipes Below)
Children Need Parties Too
With all the holiday festivities for
grown folks and for older sisters
and brothers, it’s not strange that
the youngest members of the family
beg for a party, too!
Children’s parties must be colorful,
the entertainment simple, and
the refreshments
very light. If the
party is to be a
success (and why
give one if it
isn’t?) the activities
of the youngsters
must be I
wisely directed i
from the moment i
they arrive, un- |
til they leave. I
Choose, to direct the entertainment, ;
the wisest, jolliest, child-loving adult
you know. Plan games that are
simple, and make sure that all the
children are included. Remember,
too, that children weary quickly of
any one activity, so plan a variety of
games and get the new one under
way before interest in the old one
vanishes.
Party refreshments, of course,
must be geared to the age of the
guests. If they are very young, it’s
a good idea to serve the feast at
the end of the party, so that it takes
the place of the regular evening
meal.
Decorate the table with snapping
crackers, colored balloons, and peppermint
canes to give a really festive
setting for the occasion.

“ Behind the Curtain”
YOU know, boys and girls, Old Lady Adventure has some
funny ways of sneaking up on a guy. Sometimes she just
comes up behind your back, and sometimes she drops on you
from above. And there are times, too, when she comes walking
right up to you from the front, and you don’t try to get out of her
way because she is in disguise and you don’t recognize her.
That’s the way it was with Jo h n Hoven, New York city. You
know, John started his adventuring career as a sailor before the
mast, and every sailor has half a dozen or mote adventures he
can tell you about. But the one John remembers best is his flrst
one—a thrill he got in 1894, and still remembers.
It happened when Jo h n ’s ship called at the port of San
Lucar, Spain, to take on a cargo of lead. It was the 18th of
November when they arrived there, but the weather was still
warm and balmy. In the evening, most of the crew went
ashore to see the sights of the town, John went too— and that’s when Old
Lady Adventure walked up and grabbed him.
You know, I said that the old girl with the thrill bag sneaked up on
John in disguise. She did. She came in the clothes customarily worn by
another lady known to the world as Little Rosie Romance. And John
never knew the difference until it was too late.
On tbeir way into town, the sailors from tbe ship stopped to
watch a group of Spanish senoritas and senors dancing their native
dances. John says he thinks the dance they were doing was the
fandango. Anyway, it was the sort of dance in which a senorita
who wants a new partner, just throws her shawl around the neck
of some bird on the sidelines who looks good to her. Jo h n was
standing pretty close to the platform where the dancing was going
on. and the first thing you know a shawl was looped around his
neck.
John Adds Fandango to His Accomplishments.
Now John says he never was much of a dancer, and fandangos
were way out of his class. But this girl was a beauty, and one look
from her big round eyes had John feeling that he'd dance in a barrel of
red hot nails if it would please her any. " I got away with the dance

Electric Outlets Needed
For Kitchen Efficiency
When electric outlets are being
planned in a new house for lamps,
clocks, and radios, the kitchen is
often neglectcd In reality, it has
more uses for plugs than any other
room.
Within reasonable limits, there
cannot be too many appliance outlets
in the kitchen. In this room
electricity is used both for lighting
ond for motivating power. Consumption
of current varies widely with
kitchen appliances, and special at.
tention should be given to the load
the outlet is expected to carry.
On that bed lay a dead m an, h ii throat slashed, and blood dripping
alt over the floor.
somehow,” he says, “ and then she left the platform and motioned me to
come along. She led me to a little cafe— a two-story building with a lot
of tables and chairs out in the open and a big canopy sloping down the
side of the wall. There was a big bay window above this canopy and a
sm all side entrance led to the room above."
The girl led John into that side entrance. He followed her up the
stairs and into a big room on the second floor. "She spoke to me in
Spanish," John says, "b u t I couldn't understand a word. However, I
said, 'Si, Si,' to everything she said. She smiled, and so did I. Then she
opened a cupboard, brought out some wine glasses and an empty bottle
and made a motion meaning that she was going to take the bottle and
have it filled. Then she left the room ."
John could hardly believe his luck. When the girl was gone
he began to look around the room. There was an alcove at one
end. with portiers drawn across it. He walked over and peeped
through those curtains— and right there John got the shock of his
life. In the alcove was a bed, and on that bed lay a dead m an,
his throat slashed, and blood dripping all over the floor!
“ I felt a chill run up my spine,” he says, “ and for a minute I was so
stiff I couldn’t move. I turned away from the grisly sight in the alcove
and ran toward the door. I turned the knob, but the door d id n 't give.
It was locked!”
John ran to the window—and what he saw there made the
hair stand straight up on his head. Down below in the street was
the girl, coming back—and with her were two big husky Spanish
policemen. John says that thousands of thoughts ran through his
head then, but the principal one was the realization that he was
the victim of a frame-up. That girl had killed a m an and was
going to put the blame on h im !
Says he: " I knew my only chance lay in getting out of that room.
The girl and the policemen were almost to the door now. I waited
until they were all in the hallway, and then I threw open the window.
They would be opening the door of the room at any moment, and I had
to hurry. Swiftly climbing through the window, I slid down the canopy
below it.
John Finds Dagger in Coat Pocket.
" I t was only a drop of about ten feet to the ground, and the minute
I felt earth under my feet I ran like a deer for the waterfront. I reached
it all out of breath, for I had never stopped running the entire distance
of almost a mile. I went aboard ship and sneaked below. Oifce in
the forecastle I stopped to catch my breath again. I was still shaking
like a leaf. I started to remove my coat and felt something in the
pocket. I took it out. It was a double-edged dagger, about eight inches
long, with a hollow groove in the m idd le .”
Just another link In the chain of evidence against John. The
girl had planted that knife in his pocket to make the case against
him all the stronger. He hid the thing under his mattress and
tried to calm his jum py nerves. And just then one of John’s shipmates
came Into the forecastle. "S a y , what's the matter with
you?” he wanted to know. ‘‘ You look pale as a ghost, and I saw
you running."
Well sir, John says he knew he could trust this pal of his so he
blurted out the whole story. And his shipmate laughed. “ Why,” he
said, "you just fell for an old swindle. I thought it had been ptayed out
long ago in these parts. That was only a dummy you saw in the room,
and the blood was probably catsup or something. The police were fakers,
and all they wanted to do was make you give them all your money to
keep them quiet. Don’t play around with any of those Spanish senoritas.
You're playing with fire if you do.”

Hide Away Extra Toys
So You'll Have Reserve
For ‘Indoor Days Later
Most children are flooded with so
m any toys on Christmas day that
they’re positively bewildered and

out one or more of the toys in this

have s p e c if company of your own
and want to be sure of peace and
quiet. There are two reasons for
this. Firat, children enjoy playing
intensively with a few things than
being “ snowed under” with too

some of the toys they receive at

Salvation Lassies
Retain Yule Spirit
Of Founder Booth
The marines have staked out one
more claim to fame by establishing
the fact that the ricksha that furnishes
a living for thousands of coolies
in China, Ja p a n and Singapore
was the invention of a member of
the corps.
It came about in this fashion, the
corp official bulletin states:
Private Jonathan Goble, of the
marine detachment on the U. S. S.
Susquehanna, one of the ships in
Commodore Perry’s fleet which visited
Japan in 1854, conceived the
idea.
Goble had been a farm er in New
9
York before he entered the m arine
corps in 1851 at the age of 24. He
remained in the service four years.
Ju s t when Goble conceived his
idea of the ginrikisha is not known,
but after leaving the m arine corps,
and returning to Ja pa n as a missionary,
he suggested to the Ja p a nese
the idea of m aking these enlarged
go-carts a means of conveyance.
The first ricksha, contructed as a
result of his suggestion, made its
appearance in Ja pa n in 1867, and
subsequently its use spread to nearly
all the countries of the F ar Cast.
HOLIDAY HINTS
for HOUSEWIVES
HO L ID A Y cookies and cakes
in which honey is used need
about two weeks for ripening.
They improve with age, provided,
of course, they are stored in covered
jars in a cool place.
Apples stuffed with mincemeat
and baked make a delicious winter
dessert. Wash, peel and core
the apples and stuff them an
inch from the top. Bake as usual.
Lemon sauce goes well with
this combination.
To make your holiday popovers
really pop over, be sure to have
the baking pans well greased and
very hot. The pans should “ sizzle"
when you quickly touch them
with fingers dipped in cold water.

in 1812 when Franz Gruber, organ-

j Austria, practiced one stormy eve*
I ning in the Tyrolian church. Sud*

Rushing to the 25-year-old parish
priest, Joseph Mohr, he cried:
“ Father, unless we can find music
so simple it can be sung without
rehearsal our Christmas service will
be without any m usic.’’
The young priest, called out into
the storm to a home where a firstborn
son had just arrived, returned
a few hours later and wrote the
words; Gruber stayed up all night
writing the music.
