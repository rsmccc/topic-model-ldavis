         <p>Relief a Permanent Problem
That rural relief will be a perm anent
problem for the state, because
over half of present rural relief recipients
will be public charges until
they die, is the conclusion by George
W. Hill, assistant professor of rural
sociology at the University of Wisconsin,
and Ronald A. Smith, assistant
supervisor of rural research for the
WPA. Their conclusions are explained
in the 57-page report recently published
based on their analysis of 10,000
rural families in the state.
About half of the family heads receiving
rural relief are unemployable.
The report recommends a careful readjustment
of the qualifications for
old ago assistance and dependent children
aid  to take care of most of
this class.
H alf of the employable rural relief
family heads are unskilled laborers
with no special training. Said the report,
 they live in towns, villages, and
the open country. Their average age
of approxim ately 50 years discourages
the hope that they will ever be reabsorbed
into private industry.
 It is this group, together with the
unemployables, that will require assistance
on a long time basis. Fortunately
there is sufficient conservation
work in the rural areas to put all
these employables at productive
labor.  
A third of the rural relief families
are either farm tenants or owners.
 This group offers the greatest challenge
to leaders interested in solving
the problems of farm people,   the
study said.
The report recommended that the
possibilities of the farm as a means
of providing a substantial portion of
the family living be emphasized, and
that work be provided in accordance
with a  sound labor policy,  to prevent
false standards of employment
and assure the maintenance of self
respect among workers.
North Needs Aid
Wisconsins northern counties need
relief aid and if they don  t get it people
face starvation,   the legislative
finance committee was told at hearings
on bills to raise 3 million and 5 million
dollars for direct relief.
A. J. Thelen, secretary of the Wisconsin
County Boards Association told
members that At least 5 million was
needed, and warned that  it would be
folly to pass a relief bill that only
raises three million because it would
only shift the burden and will not save
money.  
Board members from Douglas, Ashland,
Forest, and Oneida counties
described the relief plight in their
counties. Typical comments:  If we
dont have state aid the people will
starve. . . . 18,000 of Douglas countys
46,000 population are receiving some
form of government aid. . . . average
delinquent tax roll in Ashland county
was dollar171,000 a year for the last five
years.  
The 5 million dollar relief bill, introduced
by Senator Ernest G. Sauld,
Democrat, would levy a 2-cent tax on
each pack of cigarettes to raise the
needed revenue. The 3 million dollar
relief bill is authored by Senator Philip
E. Nelson, Progressive, and would
raise revenue through an emergency
tax on 1938 gross income of telephone
exchanges and toll business.
Taxea  ” Major Problem
Nearly all legislators are agreed
that the problem of creating new
taxes to meet state expenditures for
the next two years is the major task
of the 1939 legislature.
In another week, the joint finance
committee of assembly and senate
members on finance will have com
pleted public hearings on the budget
recommendations of Governor Heil.
To date most all the departments and
commissions who were slated for
 cuts   under the governor  s budget
proposals have protested vigorously
that they cannot maintain the present
caliber of state service with decreased
appropriations. The legislature can.
if it chooses, restore at least in part
some of the economies that the admin
istration has asked.
Governor Heil’s budget called for an
expenditure of 66 million dollars for
the next biennium. Add to this emergency
relief expenditures, and assuming
that the legislature approves the
decreases recommended by the governor,
the budget total will reach 70
millions, approximately that of the
previous Progressive administration.
If pension aids are increased, and if
the legislature restores any of the
 cuts   in the Heil budget, then the
cost of state government in Wisconsin
will reach a new high.
But the chief worry of legislators is
the fact, as related to them by the
governor in his budget message, that
estimates of the state regular sources
of income for the next two years 
about 45 million dollars, nearly 21 million
short of the proposed budget.
Legislative Hurdles
Bills asking more state aid and
others seeking new appropriations are
additional obstacles which the present
administration and legislature must
hurdle if the Heil budget is to be kept
down.
Foremost among these are the three
or four proposals that the highway
fund be segregated from the general
fund in order to assure that all vehicle
license and gas tax fees be used for
highway purposes only. A bill to accomplish
this purpose has been endorsed
by the assembly. Another
measure asks that voters be permitted
to voice their opinions on highway
fund diversion in a referendum.
Because the federal government
will no longer pay Bang  s disease
eradication costs unless the state participates
with a similar appropriation

Birnamwood Has
New Village Hall
The board of trustees of the village
of Birnamwood have held two 
in the fine, new hall which was
completed last month. The building, a
modern one story 54x46 foot structure
built of red Ringle brick, occupies the
site of the old hall on Main street,
opposite the public school. It was
built with WPA funds, with John
Wahlers, village clerk, as village construction
foreman, assisted by Ed.
Block, foreman of the WPA crew.
Work was started on August 21 of
last year, plans having been furnished
by Henry Oik, architect, of Antigo.
The building also houses the village
fire equipment in a room 21x30 in
size on the northeast corner, ground
floor. In a wing to the south is located
the cell room, 10x15, with plumbing
fixtures.
The main room, which serves as
council chambers and voting quarters,
is 20 x30, with fine maple hardwood
flooring and finished masonite walls
and ceiling. The room is well lighted
and cheerful, with large double windows
in the south and west walls. The
ceiling is 11  feet high, with four!
drop lights. An 8x10 record room and
an 8x10 lobby and a lavatory room
complete the main floor, which is elevated
about four feet above the fire j
department room.
A full 8-foot basement lies under
the council chambers, with an L shaped
fuel room adjoining under the
lobby and record room. A new dollar960 ]
air heater, equipped with an automatic
furnacestat and blower, comprises the
heating unit.
The entire project cost the village
of Birnamwood a little less than
dollar 5,000. The WPA furnished dollar800
towards materials and supplied all
labor, outside of some skilled labor in
bricklaying and mason work.
Members of the village board who
engineered the building project include
Dr. R. O. Frohman, president,
and Trustees H. C. Boettcher, M. E.
Brumm, A. L. Cady, Rine Gatz, E. P.
Hawkins and C. J. Roepke.
The project was not submitted to a
general election, but was handled as
regular business of the board.

FORTY-SIXTH Y EA R. W ITTENBERG . SHAW A NO COUNTY, WISCONSIN, THU RSD A Y, MARCH 2. 1939 NUMBER 1ft
Relief  ”Perm anent Problem
T hat rural relief will be a perm anent
problem for the state, because
over half of present rural relief recipients
will be public charges until
they die, is the conclusion by George
W. Hill, assistant professor of rural
sociology at the U niversity of Wisconsin,
and Ronald A. Sm ith, assistant
supervisor of rural research for the
WPA. Their conclusions are explained
in the 57-page report recently published
based on their analysis of 10,000
rural fam ilies in the state.
About half of the family heads receiving
rural relief are unemployable.
The report recommends a  careful readjustm
ent of the qualifications for
old age assistance and dependent children  s
aid,   to take care of most of
this class.
H alf of the employable rural relief
family heads are unskilled laborers
with no special training. Said the report,
 they live in towns, villages, and
the open country. Their average age
of approxim ately 50 years discourages
the hope that they will ever be reabsorbed
into private industry.
  It is this group, together with the
unemployables, that will require assistance
on a long tim e basis. F ortunately
there is sufficient conservation
work in the rural areas to put all
these employables at productive
labor.  
A third of the rural relief families
are either farm tenants or owners.
 This group offers the greatest challenge
to leaders interested in solving
the problems of farm people,   the
 «tudy said.
The report recommended that the
possibilities of the farm as a means
of providing a substantial portion of
thi family living be emphasized, and
that work be provided in accordance
with a  sound labor policy,   to prevent
false standards of employment
and assure the maintenance of self
respect among workers.
N orth Needs Aid
 Wisconsin  s northern counties need
relief aid and if they don  t get it people
face starvation,   the legislative
finance committee was told at hearings
on bills to raise 3 million and 5 million
dollars for direct relief.
A. J. Thelen, secretary of the Wisconsin
County Boards Association told
members that At least 5 million was
needed, and warned that  it would be
folly to pass a relief bill that only
raises three million because it would
only shift the burden and will not save
money.  
Board members from Douglas, Ashland,
Forest, and Oneida counties
described the relief plight in their
counties. Typical comments:  If we
don  t have sta te aid the people will
starve. . . . 18,000 of Douglas county  s
46,000 population are receiving some
form of government aid. . . . average
delinquent tax roll in Ashland county
was dollar171,000 a year for the last five
years.  
The 5 million dollar relief bill, introduced
by Senator E rnest G. Sauld,
Democrat, would levy a 2-cent tax on
each pack of cigarettes to raise the
needed revenue. The 3 million dollar
relief bill is authored by Senator Philip
E. Nelson, Progressive, and would
raise revenue through an emergency
tax on 1938 gross income of telephone
exchanges and toll business.
Taxes  ” Major Problem
Nearly all legislators are agreed
that the problem of creating new
taxes to meet sta te expenditures for
the next two years is the major task
of the 1939 legislature.
In another week, the joint finance
committee of assembly and senate
members on finance will have com
pleted public hearings on the budget
recommendations of Governor Heil.
To date most all the departm ents and
commissions who were slated for
 cuts   under the governor  s budget
proposals have protested vigorously
that they cannot m aintain the present
caliber of sta te service with decreased
appropriations. The legislature can,
if it chooses, restore at least in part
some of the economies that the admin
istration has asked.
Governor Heil  s budget called for an
expenditure of 66 million dollars for
the next biennium. Add to this em ergency
relief expenditures, and assum ing
that the legislature approves the
decreases recommended by the governor,
the budget total will reach 70
millions, approxim ately that of the
previous Progressive adm inistration.
If pension aids are increased, and if
the legislature restores any of the
 cuts   in the Heil budget, then the
cost of sta te government in Wisconsin
will reach a new high.
But the chief w orry of legislators is
the fact, as related to them by the
governor in his budget message, that
estim ates of the sta te regular sources
of income for the next two years iz
about 45 million dollars, nearly 21 million
short of the proposed budget.
Legislative Hurdles
Bills asking more state aid and
others seeking new appropriations are
additional obstacles which the present
adm inistration and legislature must
hurdle if the Heil budget is to be kept
down.
Forem ost am ong these are the three
or four proposals that the highway
fund be segregated from the general
fund in order to assure that all vehicle
license and gas tax fees be used for
highway purposes only. A bill to accomplish
this purpose has been endorsed
by the assembly. Another
measure asks that voters be perm itted
to voice their opinions on highway
fund diversion in a referendum.
Because the federal government
will no longer pay Bang's disease
eradication costs unless the state participates
with a sim ilar appropriation

Birnamwood Has
New Village Hall
The board of trustees of the village
of Birnamwood have held two meetings
in the fine, new hall which was
completed last month. The building, a
modern one  « 6ry 54x46 foot structure
built of red Ringle brick, occupies the
site of the old hall on Main street,
opposite the public school. It was
built with WPA funds, with John
W ahlers, village clerk, as village construction
foreman, assisted by Ed.
Block, forem an of the WPA crew.
Work was started on August 21 of
last year, plans having been furnished
by Henry Oik, architect, of Antigo.
The building also houses the village
fire equipment in a room 21x30 in
size on the northeast corner, ground
floor. In a wing to the south is located
the cell room, 10x15, with plumbing
fixtures.
The main room, which serves as j
council chambers and voting quarters,
is 20 x30, with fine maple hardwood ,
flooring and finished masonite walls  
and ceiling. The room is well lighted
and cheerful, with large double w in -!
dows in the south and west walls. The ;
ceiling is 11  feet high, with four
drop lights. An 8x10 record room and
an 8x10 lobby and a lavatory room
complete the main floor, which is elevated
about four feet above the fire j
departm ent room.
A full 8-foot basement lies under]
the council chambers, with an Lshaped
fuel room adjoining under the
lobby and record room. A new dollar960
air heater, equipped with an automatic
furnact stAt and blower, comprises the
heating unit.
The entire project cost the village
of Birnamwood a little less than
dollar5,000. The WPA furnished dollar800
towards m aterials and supplied all
labor, outside of some skilled labor in
bricklaying and mason work.
Members of the village board who
engineered the building project include
Dr. R. O. Frohman. president,
and Trustees H. C «. Boettcher, M. E.
Brumm, A. L. Cady, Rine Gatz, E. P.
Hawkins and C. J. Roepke.
The project was not submitted to a
general election, but was handled as
regular business of the board.

CHECK YOUR TIRES
Check your tires regularly. Keep
them at the right pressure. U nderinflation
can wear out a tire in a
hurry and will cause the wheels to
  shimmy  .

Ole Nelson
Ole Nelson was born in Bradsberg.
Norway, on June 3, 1851. He came to
the United States as a young man and
later acquired a farm near Fairchild,
Wisconsin, where he lived until he
came to the Homme Home for the
Aged on November 26, 1917. During
his first years at the institution he
drove a Model T Ford car. He was
accommodating and made many e rrands,
often going to the Orphan
Home to give children a ride. Soon he
was called   Ford   Nelson, and this is
the name he has borne in this community
for years.
Mr. Nelson was well and favorably
known in Wittenberg. He passed away
at the Home on February 22, after a
long illness, at the age of 87 years,
8 months and 19 da vs. Funeral services
wt re held on February 25 with
the Rev. H. M. Mason, manager of
Homme Home for the Aged, officiating.
Interm ent was in the institution  s
cem itery adjoining F irst Lutheran
cemetery. So far as we know he had
no near relatives.
In the field of cooperative dairy
enterprises, the Badger state is preeminent.

Shawano County Recipe W inners
Shawano county winners in the recent
Wisconsin butter recipe contest,
sponsored by the state radio stations
WHA and WLBL in cooperation with
the Wisconsin Agricultural Authority,
have been announced.
A set of four colored mixing bowls
went to Mrs. M. H. Schlytter, of Wittenberg,
for the best refipe sent in
from this county. Mrs. Mary Erickson,
of Navarino, received an ice box
dish for holding butter as the second
award; and Mrs. Albert Ziegenhagen,
of Tigerton. got an aluminum frying
pan for placing third. All others in
the county who took part in the contest
received wooden butter molds for
making fancy butter patties for table
use.More than 2,300 Wisconsin women
and girls sent in their favorite recipes
for this contest. They have shown
that using b utter in meats, vegetables,
and desserts gives these foods a rich
and pleasing flavor. The recipes also
showed that the women of the state
have worked out many ideas for unusual
foods, with butter as an essential
ingredient. As part of this statewide
butter campaign, scientists and
nutrition specialists of the state also
emphasized the fact that butter is important
to make a well balanced diet.

Chief reason for U. S. tra d e backw
ardness with A rgentina is th at
both nations sell cotton, w heat, corn
and beef. Even as S ecretary of
S tate Cordell Hull m used over an
A rgentine announcem ent that U. S.

South A m erican nation m ade an opposite
overture. F rom Brazil (biggest
South Am erican nation in point
of size, population and resources)
cam e Dr. Oswaldo A ranha, foreign
m inister, to spring a p leasant su rprise.
W hereas m odern Latin A m erican
nations have traditionally com plained
of U. S.   dollar diplom acy,  
Dr. A ranha openly invited Am erican
com m ercial participation in
B razil's developm ent. His com-
BRAZIL  S ARANHA
. . . we in America should organize . .
plaint:   B razil needs, in o rder to
bring about a rapid developm ent of
its w ealth, the collaboration of an industrial
country possessing an advanced
technologic position, and I
am sorry to say that this collaboration
has not been offered heretofore
by the United S tates.  
If U. S. Pan-A m erican advocates
liked this, they liked Dr. A ranha's
next statem ent even better:   Bolshevism
, Fascism and Naziism are
only different nam es for the sam e
m aterial conception of life which
trie s to replace God by the state,
erected as the suprem e aspiration
of the individual. It is im portant
that we in A m erica should organize
against the invasion of idealogies
which are contrary to (our) basic
ideals.  
Since the U. S. and Brazil rep resent
top-flight North  «and South
A m erican nations, it w as im m ediately
apparent that active trad e cooperation
between W ashington and
Rio would do m ore for hem ispherical
solidarity than a m ilitary alliance.
E xpected was a Brazilian
loan from the E xport-Im port bank
approxim ating 150,000,000, also important
revisions in the existing
trad e agreem ent and se ttlem ent of
the long-standing currency exchange
problem.
In tern a tio n a l
In Ja n u ary Adolf H itler told the
R eichstag that   G erm any m ust export
or die.   B ritain  s retaliation
w as creation of an export credit
pool of dollar425,000,000. P rice cutting
and other form s of cut-throat competition
often result in tra d e w ars
which end on the battlefield, a
th re at B ritain recognized even while
organizing her credit pool. A devotee
of peace via negotiation, Prim e
M inister Neville C ham berlain consequently
arranged a G erm an-B ritish
trad e conference which m eets
at D usseldorf M arch 15 and m ay
end in a U. S.-B ritish-G erm an
agreem ent to regulate competition.
A m erican industries are perm itted
to participate in c artels by the
W ebb-Pom erene act. On the eve of
D usseldorf  s conference the state
dep artm en t intim ated some 25 U. S.
industries were readying them selves
to discuss such plans. Once
this three-corner agreem ent is com pleted,
F rench, Scandinavian and
Swiss industries will be draw n into
the carte l im m ediately.
Though A m erican participation in
the plan apparently com es close to
  appeasem ent   of G erm any as advocated
by Mr. C ham berlain, the
sta te departm ent would rath er
m ake sensible recognition of the
R eich's place under the sun than
fight upset of its reciprocal trade
program by G erm an y 's m uch-despised
b a rte r system .
Treasury
Heading southw ard to help the
fleet w ard oft an im aginary aggressor
from Europe, President Roosevelt
told reporters business nnd ind
u stry need have no fe a r of new
taxes, new U. S. com petition in the
pow er field o r spending beyond
budget needs. A few m inutes later
he challenged budget critics to explain
how the governm ent could toss
aw ay its red ink bottle without
boosting tax es or elim inating "essen
tial" federal functions.
If business need fear no new
taxes, but if m ore tax es arc needed
to balance the budget, the P re sident
w as (I) contradicting him self;
(2) hinting that em ail taxpayers
could expect new levies, o r (3) sta ting
indirectly that he had no plans
for aNearly balanced budget.
In the light of figures the treasu ry
had released one day earlier, Mr.
R oosevelt  s rem ark was m ore depressing.
During 1938-39's first seven
and one-half m onths the U. S.
spent dollar5,616,760,015, or 90,000,000
m ore than the entire estim ated receipts
for 12 months. Since receipts
to d ate are only dollar3,542,601,869, total
seven and one-half month deficit is
dollar2,074,158,146. If spending continues
as expected, reaching alm ost dollar9,500,-
000,000 by June 30, the y e a r's total
deficit will approxim ate four billion
dollars.
Utilities
Until early F eb ru ary only onehalf
of T ennessee  s power cam e
from the Tennessee Valley authority.
Then Wendell L. Wilkie, storm y
petrel of Com m onwealth and Southern,
agreed to sell his firm   s Tennessee
electric properties. F or the flrst
tim e in its cam paign to acquire
choice Tennessee power fields, TVA
recognized common stock value in
utility financial structures. Ten
days later TVA rode again, this
tim e into M emphis, w here Memphis
Pow er and Light com pany sold m ost
of its facilities to TVA and the city
for dollar17,360,000. M. P   L .  s com petitor,
a city-owned corporation,
gets its electric and natural gas
distribution business. Taking stock,
TVA now finds it has all Tennessee

All the sta te   s principal cities

Political theorist, economist, patriot.
patriot before the house ways and
m eans com m ittee, defending his
plan to provide up to dollar200 a month
to persons over 60 by a 2 per cent
transaction tax.
Said Political T heorist Townsend:
  If we c a n   t establish a higher
standard of living for the subm erged
one-half of our people than dollar40 a
month, then certainly w e re not going
to be able to m aintain our type
of governm ent m uch longer.
Said E conom ist Townsend:  We
have not scratch ed the surface of
our w ealth and productive ability.  
(He added that pensions m ight eventually
be boosted to dollar300 a m onth).
Said P a trio t Townsend:   I wish
you could h ear the expressions of
contem pt ag ain st this g reat governm

and cherish with all m y heart, a
governm ent I would die for . . If
this governm ent is going to survive,
it m ust not give occasion to these
people.  
Crux of Dr. Tow nsend's argum ent
is that the profit system needs overhauling
to avoid a spread of subversive
agitation prom pted by poverty.
Well do com m itteem en know
that U. S. poverty breeds ill will,
but there is serious doubt that Townsendism
will receive congressional
precedence over the social security
revision plans P resident Roosevelt
offered several weeks ago, and
which the California doctor term s
  the height of ab su rd ity .  
Defense
L ast D ecem ber P resident Roosev
e lt  s arm s expansion program had
m ore foes than friends in the stillto-
convene seventy-sixth congress.
Two m onths later it had more
friends, thanks to clever White
House publicity m aneuvers and a
lot of sab er-rattlin g in Europe. The
house passed 367 to 15 an adm inistration
bill to spend dollar376,000,000 extra
on defense the next two years.
(Sam e day, G reat Britain voted
about dollar1,000,000,000 m ore for arm s.)
Chief features are boosting the
arm y 's aviation force to 5,500 first
line planes and m aking the P an am
a canal im pregnable. C ertain of
passage w as the Vinson naval expansion
bill to spend dollar68,000,000 on
naval a ir and subm arine bases.
But there w as little unity in this
new strength. Closely allied to rearm
a m e n t is the problem of U. S.
m ilitary alliances with o ther dem
ocracies, since the th re at that inspired
A m erican rearm a m e n t is the
sam e th re at that m akes F ra n ce and
B ritain jittery . After a California
a ir crash revealed U. S. m anufactu
re rs w ere selling m ilitary planes
to F rance, after P resid en t Roosevelt
denied telling a senate m ilitary
affairs com m ittee that U. S.   frontiers
are in F ra n ce.   the White

cam e out in full bloom. Questions:
(1) Shall the U. S. keep its
foreign policy secret? (2) Is P re sident
Roosevelt risking involvement
in w ar through secret international
d e a ls0
A fter a week  s debate there presum
ably were no longer any secrets
about either the French deal or the
ad m inistration  s foreign policy. Actual
cause of the rum pus w as apparently
rem oved, but not congressional
resentm ent.
Thundered C alifornia's Sen. Hira
m Johnson:   No epithets applied
to senators or new spapers will relieve
the situation of its secrecy
. . . T here is resentm ent among
the adm inistration that anybody
should ask the facts. But if there
com es a w ar it will not be fought
by the President alone . . .   
F acts them selves are startling.
F aced with U. S m ilitary orders
under tbe new defense bill, plane
m an u factu rers already have their
hands full with export orders. S ta rting
with dollar25,000,000 in 1938, plane
exports have roughly doubled an
nually, approxim ating dollar200,000,000
this year. In the past eight months
F ra n ce and B ritain have ordered
1,200 ships. Chief congressional
wonder is which ord ers will get
precedence, U. S. or foreign.
WASHINGTON.  ”Judging by whisp
ers around W ashington the end of
that rejection of Floyd H. R oberts
by the senate is not yet. The whole
affair seem s destined to be the m ost
im portant political m istake P re sident
Roosevelt has m ade since his
attem p t to enlarge the Suprem e
court. It seem s sim ilar to the court
episode in o th er ways. F irs t, because
both w ere, as it turned out,
so unnecessary. The P resid en t has
appointed th re e judges to the high
bench since that fight, and in all
probability will have two m ore ap pointm
ents within a short tim e,
m aking a to tal of five, a m ajority
of the en tire court, which he will
have appointed.
Also, th e co u rt fight led to the
purge, inevitably, and that purge
w as d isa stro u s in its outcom e, and
laid the foundation for trouble for
the New D eal still to com e. W hereas
the R oberts case seem s to have
no end of repercussions.
The late st is the bitterness of the
New D ealers surrounding the P re sident
ag ain st Senator
E lb e rt D. T hom as,
of U tah. T hom as
voted ag ain st confirm
ation of R oberts,
but so did 71 of his
colleagues, so th at
would not have singled
him out for special
feeling. But
when the President
w rote a long letter
to R oberts, intended
a s a b last against
the V irginia senators,
T hom as took
the floor with an answ er.
The New Deal expected an answ
er from Senators C a rter G lass
and H arry Flood Byrd. But it did
not expect any hundred p er cent
New D ealer to join them . N either
did any one else, least of all the
V irginia senators. T hom as has been
one of the most loyal and enthusiasj
tic New D ealers in the senate for the
e n tire period of R oosevelt  s tenure
I of the White House.
Senator Thom as More or
Less a Political Accident
T hom as was m ore or less of a
political accident. He cam e to the
; senate fresh from a university
! chair, never previously having m ingled
in political discussions or run
for office. He w as elected in the
anti-Hoover landslide which sw ept
Roosevelt into office in 1932, defeating
the veteran Old G uard Republican
elder. Reed Smoot.
But his nom ination w as even m ore
rem arkable. This w riter arriv ed in
Salt Lake City the day after the
convention that nom inated Thom as
had adjourned at Ogden, and the
folks in Salt L ake could talk of
i nothing else.
According to th e ir story thfe Democratic
organization had decided on
someone else. A group of alum ni of
; T hom as   university w ere boosting
him , and his nam e w as placed before
the convention in a nom inating
speech. One of the students of
the university w as in the w ings of
the th eater in which the convention
w as m eeting, listening to the speech
nam ing his hero. B ut the speech
fell ra th e r flat. The student didn't
think it had done his idol ju stice.
So he rushed on the stage, shouting,
  Mr. Speaker, M r. S p eak er!  
Senator William H. King w as presiding.
He did not know the young
m an, but recognized him . It was,
a fter all, a D em ocratic convention.
The young m an m ade a seconding
speech for Thom as. In his youthful
enthusiasm he cap tu red the im ag ination
of the delegates, stam peded
the convention, and. before the su rprised
leaders could do anything
about it, T hom as w as nom inated.
Then it becam e known that the
youthful o rator w as not only not a
delegate, but w as a R epublican!
Dr. Schacht, German Fiscal
i Expert, in the Lim elight
It would be poetic justice, certain
financial observers a re pointing out,
if Dr. H jalm ar Schacht, for so m any
y ears the tow er of stren g th in G erm
an y 's fiscal policies, should wind
up as adviser to the Bank of England.
This is not m ere speculation
  ”the idea is based on som e very
definite word from London as to the
d esires of those in ch arg e of the
  Old Lady of T hreadneedle stre e t.  
Doctor Schacht is about to sta rt
on a world trip. Not a cru ise but
a visit to most of the im portant
j countries, sta rtin g off with South
j A m erica. Another possibility which
som e are advancing is that he will
becom e an associate professor of
economics at som e big Am erican
university. T here is no scarcity of
openings w here the distinguished
G erm an authority on exchange,
budgets, etc., is desired. By m any
he is regarded as the soundest leade
r in his field in the world today,
not excluding G re at Britain and the
United States.
Incidentally, the dism issal of Docto
r S chacht by Chancellor Adolf Hitler
w as one of the big su rp rises of
the last few m onths. Doctor Schacht
had been looked up to so m uch as
being the one sound fo recaster of
fiscal affairs that no one had
d ream ed that H err H itler would deprive
the Reich of the trem endous
advantage of his advice.
R eports from Berlin since, however,
trickling in by undercover
routes, explain what happened.
Doctor S chacht had been out of
sym pathy w  ith the Reich policies
for a long tim e. M oreover, he had
been disgruntled about the tr e a tm
ent he w as receiving.
Purposely Talked H imself
Into Being Fired by H itler
Doctor S chacht m ade the firing
inevitable. He talked and talked,
to nearly anyone who would listen
to him. Not that he actually berated
H err H itler. He w'as not as
indiscreet as th at. But he said
plenty to give the im pression th at
he w as not in sym pathy with w hat
w as going on.
F o r instance, he w as asked at a
dinner party one night w hat he
thought about a certain thing th at
w as happening.
  Why ask m e ?    he retorted. " I
am ju st p a rt of the scenery. No
one consults m e about anything.  
He said this so rt of thing so m any
tim es that the various em bassies
and legations began reporting to
their governm ents that the fiscal
policies of H err H itler w ere no
longer controlled or advised by
Schacht. So H itler lost the advantage
which the prestige of S chacht  s
nam e had been bestowing.
Actually, the old m an w as like
the active president of a bank who
is   kicked u p sta irs   and m ade
ch airm an of the board  ”then given
a handsom e office with his nam e on
the door, but never called in when
the new president is deciding
w hether to m ake loans or buy
bonds.
Senator G uffey Proves to
Be an Excellent Trader
Joseph F. Guffey, whose political
m achine contributed the biggest
bloc of delegates to Roosevelt in
1932, and which in 1934 m ade Joe
the first D em ocratic senator from
P ennsylvania since the Civil w ar
and m ade G eorge H. E arle governor,
and, for a tim e, a presidential
possibility, is a good tra d e r. His
m otto is:   Find out w hat they w ant
and sell it to   e m .  
When Joe w ants anything, he
m anages to m ake the people who
a re able to give it to him w ant
him to have it. Hence the appointm
ent of F ra n cis Biddle of P hiladelphia
as federal judge.
Nobody in W ashington knew m uch
about Mr. Biddle at the tim e A rthur
E. Morgan w as
tearing David E.
Lilienthal to shreds
in interview's and
m agazine articles,
except that he had
been connected with
the National Labor
R elations b o a r d .
Nor when Doctor
M o r g a n defied
P resident Roosevelt
to his face and
insisted on a congressional
investigation
on TVA.
But w'hen the joint com m ittee w as
appointed Jo e   s fine Italian hand
appeared. White House ord ers to
the m ajority of the com m ittee w ere
that Biddle should be appointed.
Comjtaratively Easy for
G uffey to Put Biddle Across
So it w as com paratively easy for
Guffey to persuade P resident
Roosevelt to m ake the special com m
ittee accept Biddle as counsel for
its investigation, and from that mom
ent w ere ordained a w hitew ash
of TVA and sporadic raid s by the
com m ittee again st the utilities obstructing
TVA  s progress. Biddle
virtually becam e a defense counsel
for TVA.
N ew spaper m en who covered the
raid that com m ittee m ade on Chattanooga
a re still laughing over one
episode, which fits in with the av erage
New Y orker  s alleged contem pt
for the provincialism of Biddle  s
home town of Philadelphia.
The leading new spaper in C hattanooga
is the Tim es. Young
Adolph Ochs, editor of the C hattanooga
paper, w as about to be
called to the stand. R ep resen tative
C harles A. Wolverton of New
Je rsey m ade som e innocuous reference
to the connection betw een
the New York T im es and the C hattanooga
Times.
Biddle had been in touch with
G eorge F ort Milton, owner of an other
Chattanooga paper, which had
been friendly to TVA. He knew the
T im es had been on the other side.
So he dev astated W olverton for
holding such an absurd idea.
  I t  s com m on knowledge th at
there is no connection,   shouted
Biddle.
A little la te r Young Ochs went
on the stand and sta te d his nam e.
  Are you any relation to the
Adolph Ochs who owned the P hiladelphia
L edger?   inquired Biddle,
apparently im pressed with the
nam e.
  His nephew,   w as the answ er,
Mr. Ochs not explaining that his
uncle had never been exactly proud
of his Philadelphia venture.

 It doesn  t follow, then,   Rex p ersisted,
Vthat the children of such a
p atien t would be in danger of inheriting
insanity?  
 
 It certainly doesn  t. T hat brain
disturbance is a tem p o rary conditio
n /' replied Dr. Crosby.   Nothing
retro ac tiv e. The children of such a
p atien t should be in no m ore danger
of inheriting their m other  s insanity
th a n you a re or I am . Such cases
of insanity," he developed, w arm ing
a bit to the them e,   a re m a tte rs of
in tern al infection  ”of poisoned gland
conditions. You wouldn  t understand
them . We don  t understand them
any too well ourselves. But we do
know that p artic u la r type of insanity
isn  t h ered itary . And the patie
n t often m akes a full recovery
from it.  
The doctor rose.
  Helen, m ay I use your telephone?  
H ale grinned apologetically. He
h ad m ade him self som ething of a
nuisance.
  T hanks most aw fully.   He got
up also.   Now for the g aieties of
life,   he sighed.
Rex m ade his farew ells, and s ta rted
back to the C am p through the
woods. It w as alm ost six o   clock.
A pproaching a deep clum p of trees

At the sound of voices. His feet
h ad m ade no noise on the sandy
soil. Through an opening he saw
an im pressive little picture tw enty
feet aw ay. It w as com posed of an
em pty basket, a tiny new grave, a
red-eyed Ja n e and a sm all, ale rt
m an, thin-faced and furtive-eyed.
The m an w as sm oothing fresh earth
above the grave, whistling under
his breath as he did so. His cheerful
notes w ere in sh a rp co n trast to
th e bereaved expression of Ja n e   s
face and the n atu re of the digger  s
occupation.
  B eat it now,   Ja n e said u ngraciously.
  I don  t w ant you hangin

 W hat  s the idee?   the m an asked
reproachfully.   Ain  t I com e along

Ain  t I been m o th er  s little helper?
Ali right. G im m e a break. I gotta

J a n e straightened from her tragic
droop. H er m an n er w as that of
one ready and willing to go into
action.
  Jim H aines,   she broke out,
"you a in 't goin   to do no business
here. Hew m any tim es have I told
you th a t?   
T ha m an stam ped the fresh earth
into place about the grave, and
straig h ten ed slowly. He handed
J a n e the shovel hc had been wield

teeth.
"Ia that so ?   he asked cheerfully.
  Now I'll talk. 1 don  t leave these
wooda till I see one of them old
dam es. G et m e ?   
H ale had recognized the fellow. It
w as the unpleasant stra n g e r he had
seen in the m oonlight the night of
his arriv al. He had been t pving
som e sort of rendezvous then with
M iss H osanna. W hat association
could he have with the   old
d a m e s   ? H ale «prickd up his e a rs
and listened sham elessly.

Said it w as all sha h a d !   He spat
disgustedly.   The other d am e  s got
th e right idee. She coughs up a
five spot.  
 
 Jim H aines,   Ja n e said firmly.
"Y ou know w hat I   m goin   to do to

 Says you.   H aines w as still

H aines w as aquirm ing, looking

  Shut up. H aines. I   m doing the

question to ask you. How m uch
dope has this m an been supplying
to Halcyon C am p ?  
 
 Only a little, sir. Ju s t a little
bit for M rs. Spencer Forbes. It
w asn 't nothin  , really. Only 1 hate
to have him soilin   it to anyone  ” 
 Listen, Big Boy, I ain   t got   nuff

shrilly.   I wouldn  t w aste no tim e

 Shut up. You say M rs. Spencer
F o rb es doesn  t tak e m uch, Jane.
How m uch does she take? How often
does she get it? I w ant the tru th .  
 
 Only   bout tw ice a m onth, Mr.
Hale. Honest. And only a couple
pow ders then. I heard h er tell Miss
H osanna she  d never be a addick.
She says she knows too well w hat
it m eans. She tak es it as a spreelike  ”
oncet in a while. You know,
sir. The way m en gets d runk.  
 
 She  
s all rig h t,   H aines contributed
eagerly.   She  s a baby at it!   
 
 T h at  s why w e  re not going to
let h er go on. Now, H aines, h e re   s
sailed him , he w as not alarm ed
nor suspicious. S everal glasses of
iced tea and one long glass of icew
ater, drunk in quick succession on
an extrem ely hot day, m ight upset
the most accom m odating stom ach.
N evertheless the paroxysm s w ere
h orribly severe and growing m ore
so. The world turned black. He
had ju st tim e to reach for a flask
of brandy on the shelf above his
wash-bowl before he felt him self
falling. He went down with a crash
and heard that, too . . . Then, in
som e black and distan t world he
w as fum bling with a flask, trying
to get the cap off it, trying to raise
it to his mouth. He got a little of
the brandy. It didn  t help m uch.
He lost it alm ost im m ediately, in
another rending paroxysm of nausea.
His m ining experiences in rem ote
places had taught him som ething of
first aid. By the tim e the dinner
gong sounded he w as able to sum mon
Banks and tell him alm ost
naturally that he w as a bit under
the w eather and would not ap p ear
the usual hou £e group increased by
Mrs. Nash. She looked a trifle flamboyant
but very charm ing in a
flame-hued evening gown. She greeted
him with a handclasp and an
anxious glance.
    
A touch of sun,  ˜   
 he quoted
lightly, and she nodded.   You see,
I   ve com e from cool resorts like
Spain. I wilt like a flower under
New Y ork  s tropical clim ate.  
 
The next tim e you w ilt.   Mrs.
Nash invited in an undertone,
I   come over to m y Camp and do it.
i I   ll feel easier about you, if you will
prom ise th a t.  
He did not prom ise and she didn  t
press the point. Instead she abetted
him in a program that began with
old-fashioned gam es and ended in
I dancing. He directed but did not
) take p a rt in these diversions. The
old-fashioned gam es m ade a hit. as
they had done before.
Dancing followed, but proved less
popular. No one seem ed to c a re to
dance w ith anyone else. Admitting
this, th ere w as no reason why the
dancing should continue. It d;d,
  ˜You a in   t goin   to do no business here.'
m y last word to you. If I ev er see
you around this cam p again, or talk ing
to any of the people in it, I   ll
give your nam e to the police and
th ey   ll give J a n e the third degree
and get your address. We won  t

 If you like w e  ll walk o ver to the

cheerfully.   W ant to com e?  
H aines gave him a black look.
  Another thing,   H ale w ent on.
  Don  t send anyone else in your

The day after that w e  ll have you

H aines, that the police don  t like
dope peddlers. They don  t like them
At all. Now cle a r o u t.  
H aines looked at him a m om ent,
his flat head lowered. Then he
turned and disappeared am ong the
trees. A little la te r H ale heard the
ra ttle of his c a r sta rtin g on its re tu
rn journey through the woods.
CHA PTER VI
H ale d eliberately avoided the
m em bers of the house-party when
he got back to the Cam p. He heard
their voices in the living-room as
he entered the hall. They were
having tea and cocktails; but he
w ent up to his room . As he opened
the door he ca st an apprehensive
glance around him . T here w ere no
notes or dead an im als in sight.
Relieved, he crossed the room to
the closet, changed his coat for a
thin blazer and his shoes for slippers,
and sta rte d back tow ard the
davenport betw een the windows. His
idea was to stretch out there, relax,
and m ake som e plans for the evening.
On the way he stopped and
poured out a glass of ice-w ater from
the therm os bottle that alw ays stood
on the table at the head of his bed.
It w as a day that called for cold
drinks and M rs. N ash  s iced tea,
excellent though it had been, had
not wholly quenched his th irst. He
d ran k the w ater alm ost at a gulp,
w ent on to the davenport and
stretched him self out on it at full
length. The m om ent of com fort he
experienced as he did so was the
last he enjoyed for sev eral hours.
Almost im m ediately he w as in the
bathroom , actively and most violently
ill. At first, even during the
paroxysm s of acu te nausea that aa
at t    e table. He sent his apologies
to M iss H osanna, and added th at
la te r in the evening he would com e
down.
He locked the door to discourage
callers. An hour la te r he found an
em pty bottle in the bathroom ste rilized
it, and took it to the carafe
for filling. It w as possible, of course,
that in New York he had eaten
som ething injurious; but if so it was
not probable that it would have
w aited this long to inconvenience
him. He inverted the carafe over
the bottle and stared . Only a few
drops cam e forth. The carafe,
which heretofore hd alw ays held
several glasses of w ater, today had
exactly one  ”ju st enough to fill the
glass that stood beside it. He had
filled that glass and drunk its contents.
The few drops rem aining in
the bottom w ere hardly enough, of
course, for a satisfactory analysis.
N evertheless, he added them to the
drops from the carafe, corked the
bottle securely, and hid it in his
traveling case. His m ental processes
w ere clearing. No one had
m ean t to poison him ; but someone
had desired to m ake him d esp erately
sick and had certainly succeeded
in doing so.
A little after nine o  clock he went
down to the living-room. He found
however, on the ta c it understanding
that a change m ight m ean som ething
worse. When, at Mrs. N ash  a
suggestion, the affair becam e an
old-fashioned   barn dan ce,   
 Hale
led forth Miss Hosanna and took her
trium phantly through a quadrille.
He w as feeling m ore like himself,
but w hat he really w anted was
his bed.
It w as Miss Hosanna who gave
him his accolade that night. She
had been delighted by the interest
M rs. Spencer F orbes had shown
during the evening. Again and
again he had observed h er sitting
quietly in her pet ch air, watching
her friend with the ra p t expression
she usually wore when that friend
talked. It was increasingly clear
that anything which pleased Mrs.
Spencer Forbes enchanted Miss
H osanna. When the group parted
on the upper landing Miss H osanna
looked at Halo with real emotion in
her pale eyes.
  Are you sure you feel quite well
ag ain ?   she asked anxiously.
  Perfectly sure, Miss H osanna.
I   m all right now.  
 
 You have brightened us up so
m uch,   she said. She added unexpectedly,
  I begin to wonder how
we got along without you.  
(TO HE CONTINUED)
CfOR quite some tim e there have
 been rum ors that longer-jackei
suits are coming in, and the big
news is that they a re actually   in.  
See several of the latest arriv als
shown in the illustration.
Not that every jack et w ith every
suit is longer this season for the
legions and legions of nifty nowso-
voguish snug-fitting types that so
gaily flaunt bright plaid and wool
strip es atop youthful pleated or
m any-gored monotone skirts would
rise up in u tter protest to such a
statem ent. When we say  jack ets
a re definitely longer   
 we are referring
to certain m odels recently
turned out by leading designers th at
bring a distinctively   new   m essage
in regard to jack et lengths.
In addition to its sm a rt longer
length we especially call your a ttention
to the swank boxy lines of
the jack et to the left in the picture.
T his is a very new and im portant
silhouette, one, as you will observe,
in d irect contrast to the figure-fitting
basquelike snugness so popula
r of late. This striding suit by
Creed in beige and brown wool diagonal
is one of those to-be-coveted
possessions that underw rite a g u arantee
of high-style prestige at the
sam e tim e that it reg isters 100 per
cent perfect from the utilitarian
standpoint. The blouse worn with
it is of green and beige paisleypatterned
surah. Jo t down in your
notebook the im portance of surah
silk this season for both frocks and
the blouse.
Convincingly rep resentative of the
latest trend tow ard increasing
length for jack ets is the suit shown
to the right in the foreground. In
this stunning striped wool jacket
with monotone sk irt a lady of fashion
is sure to ap p ear at her best
w herever her program of activities
m ay take her during the daytim e
hours. Notice the smooth-fitting
shoulders and the m anner in which
this p atrician tailleur hugs the hips
in perfect precision. It's the way
of the new er jack ets to do just this
and the lines  »re flattering to both
the very youthful slim figure and
the m ore dignified lady with
  cu rv es.   It ia just such a pacesetting
fashion as will appeal to every
woman who knows her fashions.
G ray wool with green and red
strip es m akes the attractiv e suit
centered in the picture. The jack et
offers a com prom ise between the
longer and the shorter versions. The
advent of suits m ade of colorful
novelty woolens is one of the high
spots on the cu rre n t fashion pro
gram .
Not only is a suit im perative this
spring if you would be costum ed in
the height of fashion but with it
m ust go all the   fixings   that add
exciting detail and be assured that
the accessories that go to com plete
the new spring ensem bles are allexciting
to a sensational degree. It
is indeed a colorful story replete
with thrills that fashion is telling
in regard to the new suits and the
accessories that go with them .
It is not only that the suits them selves
involve color com binations
and co n trasts that sim ply are
b reathtaking in their daring and
originality but this d ram a of color
reflects throughout every detail of
the costum e even to the sprightly
colorful veils the w itchery of which
cannot be told in words, likewise
new footw ear which has yielded to
wild flights of color as have in fact
the countless other details that contribute
to the glory of the spring
1939 costum e. P erh ap s most significan
t of all is the challenge a   suit
seas non   never fails to fling to the

B luegill H ooked on A rtificial Fly
Found aa S porty aa the B lack Baaa
When the av erag e fisherm an
thinks of gam e fish he usually associates
the term with stream trout
or black bass. The so-called pan
fishes of our inland w aters, bluegills,
sunfishes, perch, crappies and
rock bass, are essentially food fishes
to him , possessing very little fighting
spirit or gam eness, w rites Alb
ert Stoll J r ., in the D etroit News
Still, m any have w atched fam ilies
fishing from docks and out of flatbottom
ed row boats and noticed th at
all thoroughly enjoyed hauling in
w riggling perch and side-sailing
bluegills. They appeared to find
them sporty, especially the children,
and best of all a toothsom e, sw eet
fish for dinner.
Many of us can find sporty qualities
in most any species of fish,
while oth ers m ust either play a large
brook tro u t on  –  dry fly or hook
into a record tuna or sailfish to get
a thrill. But ounce for ounce a onepound
bluegill hooked on an artificial
fly and light fly rod is ju st as
sporty as a six-pound sm all-m outhed
black bass on the end of the line.
No trout fly fisherm an ever experienced
m ore excitem ent when he
hooked into an oversized rainbow
or brown than the pan fish angler
when he fights a big bluegill on light
tackle.
This type of fishing is becoming
popular. T here w as e tim e when
the bluegill fisherm an used nothing
but c.;ck ets, g rasshoppers and
w orm r as bait, fishing in deep wate
r, but today hc flicks a fly in the
shallow s as hp would for bass nnd
generally retu rn s to shore with a fine
string.
The Pony E xpress Stations
At first the Pony E x p ress stations
w ere 25 m iles a p a rt. E ach rider
covered th ree stations, or 75 m iles
daily. L ater interm ed iate points
w ere established. The route of the
rid er w as som etim es doubled, or
even tripled, owing to unforeseen
circu m stan ces In changing horses,
saddles w ere not changed. The stationkeeper
was required to have a
pony ready, bridled and saddled,
one-half hour before the express was
due. Only two m inutes was allowed
for the change. But the pom ei
of the w estern ex p ress w ere flnelly
defeated by the m achine age.
F a s h i o n D i c t at e s
S u i t s f o r S p r i n g
Ju st a m om ent, m ilady of fashion,
a question for you to answ er,
please  ”how about a chic blouse or
two or m ore to add to your collection?
For of course now that fashion
has thoroughly convinced us that
the su it  s the thing for spring, it's
going to n ecessitate the accum ulating
of a whole w ardrobe of blouses,
for that is exactly the up-keep that
a suit season never fails to dem and.
Such a bewildering arra y of
blouses as designers are turning out
this spring is sure to lead to tem ptation.
P erh ap s the most irresistible
of all will prove to be the perfectly
adorable   baby blouse   
 lacetrim
m ed and frilled and handtucked
and otherw ise finely handworked
lingerie types. It's the last
word in blouse fashion is this pretty
confection of frothy sheer whiteness
and it is a tre at to see these utterly
fem inine blouses displayed in the
stores for they are so very lovely
and it  s been such a long tim e since
j they held the cen ter of the stage
; but fashion  s spotlight is definitely
' upon them for spring and sum m er.
T i e r e d T h e m e s i n
N e w S i l h o u e t t e s
T iered them es give evidence that
j the d ress designers are searching
I for som e new m eans to vary the
 silhouette. The tie rs, usually three
1 in num ber, distinguish the skirts of
som e advance spring dressm aker
su iti as well as sheer woolen frocks
The broken tiered treatm en t with
a stra ig h t panel at the front and
j back of a sk irt and the flounces at
either side offers a suggestion for
those who cling to slenderness of
line. The blouae, which has a

State Capital Letter
(Run-over from first page.)
may cost the state a million dollars.
Farm ers have swamped the legislature
with petitions asking that the
Bang's program be continued. They
ask a dollar100,000 appropriation.
State employes through their organization,
the Wisconsin State Employees
Association are asking for a
retirem ent plan.
Numerous bills ask increased pension
aids. Even if pension grants remain
at the present level, statistics
prepared by the state pension board
show that 1 Va million dollars more
will be needed than is provided for in
the present budget.
A. J. Thelen, secretary of the County
Boards Association points out that
3 million dollars for relief, the amount
appropriated last session, will not be
enough. 5 million is needed.
Then, too, there are smaller request.'
uch as funds for a short course dormitory,
and a state chain of police
radio stations.
A Sales Tax?
The possibility of a sales tax is frequently
mentioned in the corridors anc  
corners of the state house. Some
legislators believe that it is the only
feasible answer. However, floor lead
ers m aintain that there will not be a
sales tax enacted this season, but they
also state that within three or foui
years Wisconsin will have a sales tax,
because if state costs continue to rise
there will be no other way out.
It is expected that the adm inistration
will present its tax program to
the legislature immediately after the
budget bill is disposed of and it becomes
definitely known how much
money will be needed.
While there has been no official
'tatem en t as to what the adm inistration
will offer in the form of tax
m easures, rum or about the capitol is
that the following proposals are being
considered: (1) A cigarette tax. (Billt
to enact a cigarette tax have been infroduced
in both houses.) In the assem bly
the funds raised would be allotted
to pensions and the senate bill asks
that they be used for emergency relief.
(2) Reenactment of the dividends tax.
and the 60 per cent income surtax.
(3) Reenactment of a more productive
chain store tax. (4) Enactm ent of a
filing fee for income taxes, because at
present it costs the state just as much
to review an income tax statem ent
which brings in a quarter or nothing
as it does a larger return. (5) Legal
diversion of highway funds.
Kill Speed Limit Proposal
Wisconsin will not have a maximum
speed law  , the assembly decided when
it killed. 60 to 28, Assemblyman
William Sweeney  s bill to set speed
limits of 60 miles an hour in the daytime
and 50 miles an hour at night.
During the week the assembly also:
Engrossed a bill authorizing counties
to appropriate funds for county
museums.
Made ready for final passage a bill
allowing school boards to discharge or
retire school teachers under the tenure
law after they reach the age of 65.
Advanced a bill by Gruska of Mosinee
barring sale of beer to minors
under 21 years of age unless accompanied
by parents or guardian. (P resent
law is 18 years for beer and 21
years for hard liquor.)
Engrossed a bill outlawing the sale
and possession of m arijuana. The bill
also places m arijuana in the category!
of noxious weeds subject to eradication.
NOTICE GIVEN ANTIGO
P. C. A. THAT IN TER EST
RATES W ERE REDUCED
Interest rates to members of the
Antigo Production Credit Association
was reduced one-half of one per cent
on all money advanced beginning
February 24. E. A. Waidelich, secretary-
treasurer, announced for the
hoard of directors of the Antigo Production
Credit Association.  This is
made possible,   said Secretary Waidelich,
 by the continued ready sale to
the investing public of federal intermediate
credit bank debentures bearing
low rates of interest, and by the
favorable operating results of the interm
ediate credit banks and production
credit associations during 1938.  
Secretary Waidelich explained that
the farm ers   notes which the association
takes are discounted with the
Federal Interm ediate Credit Rank of
St. Paul.
 The new rate will be four and onehalf
per cent a year, and as usual
interest will be charged only for the
period which the members actually
have the money. The reduction also
is effective in all the other production
credit associations throughout the)
country.  
The Antigo Production Credit Asso-I
ciation, according to Secretary Waidelich,
last year did a business totaling
dollar604,000,000.  These loans   he said
 are made for agricultural purposes,
and repayments are made at the time
when the member is best able to pay,
either from the sale of crops or livestock
or other operations financed.  
('tm fributrtl Hu '.S'//////
All the old w eather indicators have
held true thus far this year. Feb. 2
the ground hog saw his shadow and
we  ve certainly had our taste of winter
  ” nay verily, not a taste but a full
meat1 of cold w eather until now we are
surfeited. But we dare not let hope
soar yet awhile. March has come in
like a lamb after February made an
exit with g reat bluster; so we can, if
the indicators still indicate truly, expect
March to  go out like a lamb  
ushering in an April Fool. This is,
perhaps, a pessim ist  s point of view;
and  the difference between an optimist
and a pessimist is droll. The
optim ist sees the doughnut. The pessimist
sees the hole.  
Well anyway. March is here; so
i prir.g is not fa r off. And how well
we know that  in spring a young
m an  s fancy lightly turns to thoughts
of love. For     
tis evidence quite certain
of a wooing rather rash, w hen;
you see a tinge of powder on a young!
m an  s dark moustache.  
Ar.d of course in the spring a j
woman  s fancy anything but lightly,
turns to thoughts of house cleaning.
In the good old days a woman swept j
down cobwebs, rolled up her sleeves
   nd scrubbed up her house till windows
gleamed, floors shone, curtains |
were stretched, and the whole house- I
hold groaned and ate soup and sand- ;
wiches while mother enjoyed an orgy  
of hard work and self pity. Now. i
however, Good Housekeeping Insti- j
tutes  ”county, state and national  ”  
have em ancipated mother. She cleans
the draw ers, closets, and book cases in ;
January and February  ”if she  s a
modern and scientific housekeeper and 1
an emancipated woman. She sweeps
:r floor like a professional golfer teeing
off, following through each stroke i
of her broom to give herself slender-'
izing exercise. She lies prone and
stretches like a cat when she dusts
under bed and chairs  ”that  s good ex- '
ercise too. I don  t know w hether she
meows like a cat to exercise her vocal
cords or not. Maybe it isn  t necessary
since woman is naturally catty, j
She skates around on a small platform !
when she scrubs or waxes a floor, and j
she walks up steps as if she were a j
Pueblo Indian balancing a w ater jug
on tfer head. In other words, our  – 
emancipated mother of today is more
self conscious and perhaps less house j
conscious than the homemaker of y e s -;
terdav. How   we revel in the casserole
meals and easy desserts of house-|
cleaning time. Even if we never see
them on the table we can all enjoy
them over radio while we eat o u r !
sandwiches and soup.
  
And while mother cleans house
beautifyingl.v, father pores over seed I
catalogs and gets an itch for his spade
while he dreams the garden that never)
quite is.
Yes, in the spring each one  s fancy j
finds a stim ulant in the spring.
Benefits of Library
Free public library service forms
an indispensable part of any wellrounded
program of community life.
Every American citizen, from childhood
to old age, should have a publicly
supported library. Books should be
accessible to all; readers of all ages
should be served.
The depression bringing increased
demands for service from a public
who had more time to read, only revealed
the need more strongly and increased
the importance of the task
Wisconsin libraries have sought to
perferm   ”free public library service
to every man, woman and child in the
state.
But with this increased demand for
service, came reduced appropriations
and lowered budgets and librarians all
over the state found themselves overwhelmed
with opportunities for service
with only curtailed funds to meet
the challenge.
At the present time, 904,956 people
or 31 per cent of the total population
of Wisconsin have no local public
library service of any kind while the
other 69 per cent have many libraries
so inadequately equipped with books
and staff that they cannot meet the
needs of those who wish to use them.
Three entire Wisconsin counties
have no library service whatsoever
while in 39 counties only half the residents
are served by public libraries.
The American Library Association
recommends dollar1.00 per capita as the
minimum at which effective library
service can be maintained. Massachusetts
leads with an expenditure of
dollar1.08 while Wisconsin ranks 13th
among the states operating on 44
cents per capita.
A statewide movement has been begun
to improve and extend library
facilities throughout the state.
 Yes, in the poor m an  s garden grow
F ar more herbs and flowers  ”
Kind thoughts, contentment, peace
of mind.
And joy for weary hours.

FARM ERS TO SIGN
IN TEN TION SH EETS
In order to receive payments this
fall under the 1939 agricultural conservation
program each Shawano
county farm er will need to show his
intention of cooperating in the profiiam
by sicrning a completely worked
out farm plan this spring.
However, O. B. Hagen, chairm an of
the county agricultural conservation
committee, announces that signing the
plan is not binding upon the signer.
If, after the planting season gets
under way, the farm er finds that he
must change his plans, he can of
course do so. His earnings then will
be governed by his actual plantings
and the soil building practices which
he puts into effect.
O. B. Hagen emphasizes that no one
can get a paym ent next fall unless he
signs before the deadline this spring
and cooperates in at least part of the
program this summer.
G etting corn or wheat loans or
wheat crop insurance next fall and
w inter is also dependent upon signing
the worked out farm plan, O. B.
Hagen explained. Those who fail to
cooperate and who fail to sign will be
ineligible for the special crop loans
and insurance under the agricultural
conservation program .
Plan sheets and computation sheets
for each farm in the county are being
prepared now, he continued. They will
be available to all farm owners within
the next few weeks. The information
on these sheets will allow farm owners
to fit the agricultural conservation
program to their own farm plans.
The plan sheets show the acreage
allotm ent of soil-depleting crops, including
special allotm ents for corn,
wheat and other crops for the farm ,
he indicated. By means of the computation
sheet which goes with the plan
sheet, the farm owner can determine
his goal of soil building practice units
and can estim ate the largest payment
he can earn by planting within his
acreage allotm ent and by carrying out
his soil building goal.
KNOW AHEAD
There is advantage, if not necessity,
in being informed of facts in
advance. Funeral costs are no exception.
Left to the last minute,
costs are not so easily, clearly an alyzed,
in the emotional'confusion.
Value and worth are not so readily
appraised, compared, appreciated.
It is quite custom ary for folks to
stop and talk with us.

Tigerton Man Found
Shot; Hunt Robbers
Chas. Roepke, about 60, of T igerton,
was brought to the Shawano Hospital
Monday night with a bullet lodged in
his head. He told an am azing story
of being held up by two men on
F ebruary 22, shot in the act of resisting
and forced to rem ain in a condition
too weak to summon aid.
Undersheriff Otto Druckrey said a
possible suicide theory did not fit the
case from what has been developed.
He said there are no powder burns to
indicate Roepke was fired at from
close range and a thorough search of
the house and premises revealed no
trace of a gun.
An X-ray by Doctor A. A. Mendez,
Tigerton physician, who was summoned
immediately, revealed a lead slug
broken in two pieces lodged near the
man  s nose. The peculiar p a rt of it
was, Druckrey quoted the doctor as
saying the bullet entered through the
ear cavity, leaving no exterior traces
of a wound.
Roepke must have bled profusely,
the undersheriff said, as in the room
where the man had been since last
W  ednesday, blood was much in evidence.
A bloodstained, scrawled penciled
note was found on the dresser with
these words:  Dear friends  ”I was
shot Wednesday by a man who took
my money.   Roepke said later he had
been robbed of dollar17.
He described his assailants as two
men of moderate build, one w earing a
brown overcoat and the other a tan,
who came to his home to inquire
directions. They returned about an
hour later, he said, shot him and took
his money.
Monday afternoon a neighbor of!
Roepke by the name of Voight saw |
him motioning through a window.1
Voight investigated and called the
village marshal, Bill Kielblock, who
notified relatives and Shawano county
authorities.
 We searched that place from one
end to the other,   under-sheriff O tto 1
Druckrey said,  but we could not find
anything that even looked like a gun.

GAME CEN SUS REPO RTS
The state conservation departm ent j
is checking its return of game census
reports from the la st season and finds I
that many hunters have failed to com-1

licensed hunter to list birds and animals
he may have taken during the
year. W'here a hunter has failed to
take any game he is required to re- j
port that fact. The system of game i

With the coming of March the
thoughts of the Homemaker turn
toward Spring. Plans for gardens,
seed catalogues, new perennials and
spring bulbs are fascinating subjects
to occupy her leisure moments. She
must have a new gay house frock to
match this mood, therefore, she
selects  The A ttractive House D ress  
as her project for study during the
month of March. Miss Gladys Meloche,
clothing specialist from the
A gricultural Universtiy Extension Departm
ent. will bring new and interesting
points on the selection and construction
of this im portant spring
frock to the leaders of clubs in the
Shawano Center on Friday, March 10,
at the U tility Building. A fter an allday
discussion beginning at 10 o  clock
in the morning, the leaders will be
prepared to carry this m aterial back
to their own club members.
Wednesday, March 15, the leaders
of the W ittenberg center will meet at
the home of Mrs. C. Sundet in W ittenberg
to discuss and exchange ideas
about this attractive house dress with
Miss G ertrude M. Hoffman, County
Home Demonstration Agent.
The State Stations are seeking reports

Frank Hellstrom had to give three
shows Saturday night in order to accommodate
the crowds that came to
see  Gold Mine in the Sky.   This was
to a large extent, we believe, due to
the fact that Orval and Daisy Rhodes,

community, were advertised to appear
in the picture. Many were able to
recognize Orval, who played a bass
viol, as he appeared with the m usicians
fo r a brief space of time twice.
Daisy was scheduled to have a p art
in the picture as one of the singers,
but illness at the last minute made a
substitute necessary, relatives learned
last week. So her friends missed seeing
her in the picture.

March 5, at 2:00 p. m. sharp. Entree
fee: One dollar. Prizes will be given
according to number of player entered.
Wisconsin  s application to the Federal
Communications Commission foj1
a full-time, high power broadcasting
station will be heard on May 1, according
to notification just received by
the A ttorney G eneral  s office. O riginally
set for F ebruary 28, the hearing
was postponed to allow more time for
the preparation of the S tate's case.
In its application the State is ask ing
for a 16 hour a day station to
operate in conjunction with the U niversity
of Wisconsin and capable of
being heard in all p arts of the state
at night, as well as in the daytime.
The two public stations now m ust go
off the air at sundown to avoid interference
with private stations on the
same channels.
Observers predict that the granting
of the application would remedy an inequitable
situation in which four clear
channels out of forty in the nation
are assigned in Illinois, while not even
one is allowed to Wisconsin. The
communications act of 1934 specifically
requires a  fair, efficient, and
equitable distribution   of facilities
among states and communities.
The application requests the use of
670 kilocycle channel, the one selected
by engineers as being the best able of
any assigned in this mid-western re-
I gion to render the service necessary
j over the entire sta te of Wisconsin.
I That frequency is now used by
WMAQ, one of the 168 stations on the
) NBC network, and one of three sta tions
in Chicago carrying NBC pro-
grams.
The new station would provide an
 All-W  isconsin   radio service. It
would sell no time for advertising and
so would not enter into competition
with newspaper or private stations.
Its program s service would be based
on the same standards which carried
S tate Station WHA to the national
ranking America  s outstanding  Social
Service Station   in the V  ariety Showmanship
A wards for 1938.
Engineer  s studies show that moving
the station into the state would
give prim ary radio service to great
areas in Wisconsin which now do not
enjoy such coverage. There are large
areas in the sta te where no Wisconsin
station can now be heard at night.
Plans for an extensive program service
of state-wide interest have been
made. This would include discussion
program s for adults, extension
courses, organization features and a
host of non-duplicating programs to
tie in with the life, interests and activities
of Wisconsin people.

P rogram for Farm er-
B usinessm en  s Meeting
The program committee met S aturday,
Feb. 25, in the County Agent  s
office to plan the program for the
F arm er Businessmen  s meeting which
will be held at Shawano on March 16.
A sim ilar meeting was held last
year and was the forerunner of a large
number of like meetings in the state
and the idea spread to many other
states.
Each soil committeeman will bwng
to this m eeting a businessman as his
guest. This year the banquet will be|
held at noon and the discussion will
include a m orning session and an a fternoon
session.
In the m orning different local people
will present information on various
phases of Shawano County Agriculture  ”
such as soil areas and soil types,
soil deficiencies, land usage, crops
grown, sources of income, dairy sta tistics,
m arketing, etc. Following the
noon day banquet, the afternoon session
will be devoted to a general discussion
of Shawano County  s Agricultural
problems and what can be done
to solve them.
Guest participants on the program
will be R. K. Froker of the College
of A griculture at the state university!
and a representative of the state AAA
office.
I,w al F arm ers Earn P ay m

Shawano county farm ers can earn
payments in two different ways under
the 1939 agricultural conservation program.
O. B. Hagen, chairman of the county
agricultural conservation committee,
says that the largest payments
can be earned by planting within the
acreage allotm ent of soil-depleting
crops for the farm.
Supplementary payment can also be
earned by a second method, that of
carrying out approved soil-building
practices.
Both methods, he indicated, bring a
cash addition to the farm income. He
emphasizes, however, that they do far
more than that in aiming toward the
goal of really good farming.
The aim of both methods is to leave
the producing soil of the farm in better
condition at the end of the year
than it was at the beginning, he declared.
Smaller acreage of soil-depleting
crops mean greater acreages
of grasses and legumes. Grasses and
legumes, it was explained, cut soil
losses from soil washing and erosion
down almost to the vanishing point.
Certain soil-building practices are
designed to increase the valuable organic
m atter in the soil by making
more favorable conditions for the

A dventure su re laid an icy hand on th e shoulder of Joseph
K uritz, who se n t m e one of the best w ritten y a rn s I   ve had to
d ate. J o e   s at Brooklyn now and at la st w riting could have used
a job. He gave up his youthful am bition to be a m ining engineer
as a resu lt of ev en ts related in today  s sto ry , and sw itched to
m echanical engineering. But, if you ask m e, th e m agazines a re
looking for people who can w rite like Joe.
A ccordingly, I  m following his scrip t p re tty close. In April,
1920, Jo e w as a su rveyor with th e Glen A lden Coal Co., Scranton,
P a. It w as his first job, and he w as assig n ed to investigating
  p illar robbing   in the C ayuga m ine. I  ll explain.
M iners m u st leav e enough coal to su p p o rt the roof of the

and is illegal, since it m ay cause cave-ins in which w orkers
are killed, gas and w ater m ains burst, even explode, and brick buildings
standing on the land collapse. It's earth q u ak e, fire and Hood.
Old T im bers P rove U seless a s Support.
The C ayuga had been d eserted for 50 y ears. Inside Joe and three
com panions found pillars cracked and crum bled by the weight of millions
of tons of rock they had held up for five decades. As supports they
w ere useless and m ight ju st as well have been m ined out. Old tim ber
erected by m iners to protect them selves in those far, bygone y ears
w ere rotted, useless. A touch and they collapsed to fungi-infested, m ildewed
dust. Not m uch between Jo e and the m illions of tons of rock
over his head.
W orse, the workings w ere of the   pitch " type  ”each ch am b er
like a long, sloping tunnel, som e very steep. The roof w as d an gerously
cracked. Slabs of shale hung so loose a breath would
send them crashing to the floor. F allen rock covered the steeplyslanting
floor in sizes from a flst to dining-room table. This

Advice to Homemaker on How to Feed Families During
Coldest Days of Winter; Essential Nutritive
Values Described in Terms of Everyday Foods
By C. HOUSTON GOUDISS
TOWARD the end    of winter we sometimes experience
some of the coldest weather of the entire season. Temperatures
remain below freezing for days at a time. The air
is often raw and penetrating, and blustery winds make it
seem as if man is being persecuted by nature.
Moreover, this trying weather comes after months of short
and often sunless days ,
spent in overheated houses,
and without sufficient exercise.
So it is no wonder that
the body is on trial . . . fighting
to maintain health . . . to
avoid the colds and other respiratory
diseases that are so
prevalent. This is, perhaps, one
season when food has a mightier
power than al any other lime to
influence physical well-being.
F ruit pies are splendid for cold
weather meals, fruit and gelatin
combine nicely, and fruit m ay be
incorporated in cakes, as in appla
sauce cake.

JUST RIGHT
Food Your First Defense
In general, women seem to be
more aware of the power of food
than men. This is
fortunate, because
they are charged
with the solemn responsibility
of determining
w h a t
foods their families
shall eat. Since the
right food sometimes
makes the
difference between
sickness and health
their husbands and
children are the
unhappy losers if they fail to recognize
the need for even one essential
food substance.
Occasionally the homemaker  s
task is m ade more difficult by
men-folks who pooh-pooh the idea
that meals should be planned scientifically,
and who point out that

Rounding Out Day's Nutrition
Whether the third m eal of the
day is lunch or supper in your
household, it should round out the
day  s nutrition. I f you need to
get more m ilk into the diet, let
your lunch or supper include a
cream soup. If you haven  t served
eggs previously during the day.
d a y s w h ic h m a n y p e o p le h a v e choose a souffle or a dish containing
crcamed eggs. A starchy
food, a salad, a dessert and a beverage
will complete a meal that
both satisfies the appetite and
meets nutritional requirements.
It is not diflirult to obtain the
day  s quota of minerals, vitamins,
cellulose, protein, carbohydrates
and fats. These substances are
to be found in delicious, wholesome
foods. All you need to remember
is not to serve too much
of one food and too little of another.
Let the balanced diet be your
ideal  ”and cold weather will prove
a tonic instead of a possible men-

Oo They (io Together?
Little Molly was visiting on the
farm of her grandfather. She went
with him to feed the sheep. A little
lamb came up to her and started
wiggling its tail.
  Grandpa, why do lambs have
tails?   she asked.   The flies don  t
bother them.  
People who hold this view fail
to take into consideration that
many of our ancestors consumed
a satisfactory diet without knowing
it.
also contribute important m inerals
and vitamins.
Vegetables  ” Raw and Cooked
There should be vegetables  ”one
or two of them. Green leafy vegetables,
either fresh or canned,
should be served several times a
week . . . for their iron and vitam
ins A, B, G, and sometimes C.
These may be alternated with the
yellow vegetables which are particularly
notable for their vitamin
A. Don  t overlook onions  ”they
are inexpensive, and a fine source
of bulk. Served raw, they provide 5e 
a substantia) amount of vitam in C,   " " " " "
the vitam in for which we especially
prize oranges, grapefruit
and tomatoes.
Include a salad at dinner, lunch
or supper; it is well for most norm
a l individuals to eat some raw
food daily. In cold weather, dress
it generously with salad dressing
for extra fuel value.
Dessert may be pie, pudding or
gelatin. The choice depends partly
upon the other foods served at
dinner, partly upon the dessert
to be served at the third meal of
the day. But here is a good general
rule to follow. Serve a fruit
dessert at one m eal  ”and a pudding
containing m ilk at the other.
Of course, the fruit need not he

Safeguarding Health
They should realize also that one
can suffer from dietary deficiencies
and live . . . though he may
not live well! A m an can exist
upon much less than the amount
of iron required for normal
health . . . but he probably cannot
escape secondary anemia. He
may be able to get along on a
meager supply of vitam ins . . .
but the chances are that his vitality
will be greatly diminished. And
he will face the constant threat of
disease that follows in the wake
of lowered resistance.
Nothing is more foolish than to
suppose that what a m an eats is
entirely his own business! It is a
matter of grave concern lo his
wife and children. For it has hern
suggested that fully one-half of
the illnesses of the American people
may be traceable directly, or
indirectly, to dietary deficiencies.
Let no m an. therefore, twit his
wife for trying to feed him correctly!

SOUND ENOUGH
Time for Good Eating
But don  t imagine for a moment
that correct eating and good eating
cannot be synonymous. It is
true that there is no time of year
when correct eating is more im portant.
But it is also a fact
that there is no time of year when
good eating is more distinctly indicated!
These are the days when breakfasts
must be especially hearty
. . . to satisfy keen appetites, to
provide generous amounts of fuel
or energy values. That means cereals
always, and aome form of
breadstuff, pancakes or waffles.
Cereals are p rim arily energy
foods, but they m ay also carry
substantial amounts of precious
mineral salt ar.d vitamin B.
Whole grain varieties are also a
good source of Irulk or cellulose
. . . so necessary for regular
health habits . . . so often over
looked in diets tnat are carelessly
planned.
Eggs belong on the breakfast
menu, too, because they are a topnotch
protective food. And there
must be fresh or stewed fruit  ”
for vitam ins, minerals and rough
age.

be digested efficiently.
It should oe built first of all
around a protein food: meat;
fresh, canned, or quick-frozen
fish; cheese, chicken, an egg dish,
or a casserole of hearty baked
beans. There should be an energy
food such as sweet or white potatoes,

it in good running order. You can do it yourself,
right out on your farm.
The John Deere gives you everything you want
in a tractor for your heavy farm jobs  ”adaptability,
power, economy, light weight, simplicity, and accessibility.
I t supplies drawbar, belt, and power takeoff
service to reduce your labor costs, to do your
work when it should be done, to give you more time
for other duties or for recreation.
Investigate the John Deere fully. Ask any one
you know who owns one. Come in and let us show
you why the new model is better than ever.
