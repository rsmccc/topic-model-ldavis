court for its approval 
Judge Crosby has inaugurated a
new arrangement that has worked
out very satisfactorily Prior to his
entrance into the oifice it was customary
for the court to hold just
the spring and fall terms in the counties 
and attorneys and litigants who
wished to have matters brought before
the court found it necessary to
go to the county in which the judge
resided to take up these cases between
terms Under Judge Crosby s
airangement there is a motion day in
Clark county every Saturday o f the
month and a motion day in each of
the other two counties once a month 
Cases that are not triable by a jury
are disposed o f these days giving the
litigants and attorneys an opportunity
to dispose o f their cases promptly 
and doing away with the long 
tedious calendars in the spring and
fall terms that prevailed under the
old system A large expense is not
only saved the county as court costs
in running the court but there is
also a saving to litigants having matters
before the court 
As judge o f the circuit court he
has justly gained an excellent reputation
as a fair fearless and impartial
jurist He has kept the work o f his
court up to date giving close attention
to the cases which came before
him and discharging his duties firmly
and promptly He has often been
called to preside over the courts o f
other circuits in the trial o f important
cases and has often heard cases o f
state wide interest 
In his campaign for reelection he
has the strong support o f his record
on the bench and o f a wide circle o f
loyal friends He will undoubtedly
receive a big vote testifying the faith
o f the voters o f his district in his
character and quality as Judge o f the
17th Judicial Circuit

FOLLIES BE AU TIE S V ISIT CITY
Last Tuesday evening the local
bowling fraternity was treated to the
rare sight o f a team o f Follies Beauties 
bowling under the banner o f
Tollack s Coal eens in a league match
against the Hagen Clothiers The
Clothiers by the way had a small but
active picket line on duty before Nemec s
Alleys protesting against the
various vices o f the Coals This picketing
doubtless convinced Captain
Jim o f the folly o f sending his regular
team out to battle the Clothiers 
Whatever caused him to change his
mind the team o f girls which represented
him was a big improvement
over his regular team 
The Coal eens line up was composed
o f Harvey Richards who was attired
as a staid old dame o f some 60 years
ago Petite Bean Hagen glamour
girl Don Perry vivacious Andy Richards 
and that bold flapper Jim Tol 
Against all this display o f pulchritude 
the Clothiers o f course did the
gentlemanly thing and allowed the
girls to take the first game but then
Knighthood or chivalry or whatever
it is was all forgotten and the
Clohiers won the last two games 
A fter the bowling group photographs
were made o f the two teams
and they then repaired to Lloyd s
basement where the ladies were treated
to lunch by their hosts 
On Wednesday afternoon everything
had returned to normal altho
it is understood on good authority
that one o f the girls had to use
paint remover to get the polish off
his finger nails

THE RAM BLER
Spring is here tra la tra la! Balmy
days sunny skies and love in
bloom! (Ah h h h) And spring vacation
only a few hours away This
is the life!
W e ve just finished taking a good
dose o f good ol fashioned sulphur
and molasses as we re down with a
very hard case o f spring fever It
would take nothing less than an
earth quake to shake us out o f our
daze So bear with us while we
sleepily ramble on 
Cupid s Couplets: Romance o f the
week is Erva Loomis and Bob Smith
(yep spring is here without a
doubt) The Northrup Hanson affair
has resumed where it left off after a
break o f two whole days ( What will
poor Bob H do now )
Three cheers for Mr Johnson (hurrah 
hurrah hurrah!) for finally letting
us open the windows in senior
high At last we can assimilate
knowledge in comfort (or at least get
fresh air during our naps) 
Joke o f the week: Two little gals
were gabbing in the locker rooms 
 What kind o f boys do you like best 
conceited or the other kind asked
one little gal What other kind 
retorted the other (W e refuse to
comment )
Style note for the girls signifies
comfort personified Several Mondays
ago a good share o f the fair sex
appeared at school with their shirt
tails hanging out! The fad was shortlived 
however What s the matter 
girls Did the laughs and ribbings of
the boys and faculty get the best o f
you 
Pet Gripe: These people that sit
in assembly programs class meetings
and the like giggling and talking 
Consider others Maybe some one
would like to hear what s being said 
Prom queen news: Same as last
time Until Stanley chooses his
queen we shall haunt him He ll be
in every column So in self defense 
Stan you d better quit stalling 
It s no use! With spring here and
vacation just around the com er trying
to concentrate just simply can t
be done 
See you in the Easter Parade 
Ho hum 
HOBBY SHOW NEWS
The latest fad to sweep the country
is that o f hobby shows Almost
every evening in your paper you can
read about some organization in a
city giving a hobby show Black
River Falls is far ahead in this idea
as we have already had a successful
hobby show more than a year go 
Don t forget to start right now 
and arrange your hobby for display
to be held at the high school auditorium 
The tentative date has been set
for Friday evening Saturday and
Sunday April 21 22 and 23 You
will notice that it is being held on a
Sunday also which would enable
more people outside the city to attend 
Try to think o f a novel way o f displaying
your hobby so the exhibits
will vary a little from last year 
Let s every one get busy and do
some advertising for the soon tocome
 Hobby Show 
SPRING V A C A T IO N
ST A R TS FRID AY
Hip! Hip! Hooray! Hip! Hip!
Hooray! W e re glad Spring vacation
is on its way 
Once more Spring has arrived and
wit hit it brings Spring vacation 
which to most o f us is a great gift
o f joy When the doors o f the school
buildings close Friday night March
31 the pupils are free that is free
from the clutches o f school for a
week or until April 10 Every one
had better get busy and make plans
for your vacation if you have not
already done so because there won t
be very much time when it gets here 
I f any o f you plan to have Spring
Fever then is a swell time don t
you think so You can really lie
around then and there will be nothing
to worry you such as passing
from one class to another or having
a teacher catch you shirking on the
 job However let s every one have
one grand time

The program was made up o f selections

P A R C E L POST SUGGESTIONS
BY COUNTY PO STA L GROUP
There was a 7 o clock dinner at
the New Freeman hotel Friday night
enjoyed by the members o f the Jackson
County Postal Group o f which
Earl Young o f Melrose is president 
The group meets monthly for dinner 
and enjoys an informal program
and discussion O M Rickard postmaster
at Merrillan and Herbert Van
Winter Merrillan rural carrier and
William Sawyer carrier at Melrose 
appeared on the program which covered
problems o f rural carriers by the
first two and a reading by Mr 
Sawyer 
In Mr Rickard s talk he offered
the following suggestions to persons
mailing parcel post packages in order
that they might be properly endorsed
at the post office to show if
the parcel contained anything perishable
or fragile The Postal Employees
respectfully ask all senders o f
parcel post to carefully observe the
following suggestions 
Use suitable container or wrap
well If fragile use a heavy corrugated
paper box which will not
crush easily and see that contents are
packed so that they will not be loose
in container Perishable articles
such as poultry should be in a strong
corrugated paper box 
If contents are fragile write
 Fragile on outside o f parcel and if
perishable write Perishable on the
outside 
Write your return address on upper
left hand com er o f parcel and
the address on lower center o f parcel
and use pen and ink instead o f pencil 
Parcels containing perishable articles
which will reach destination on
Saturday should be sent Special Delivery 
Insure parcel when failing The cost
is small and you are protected 
You are not permitted to put written
matter in parcel as this subjects
parcel to first class rate o f 3 cents
per ounce If you have written matter
or message which you would like
to have dispatched with parcel then

When Congress created the Federal
Housing Administration June 27 1934 
Title I of the Act relating to modernization
and repair was intended to be
temporary The date of its expiration
will be June 30th next 
Since it is not certain that the Act
will be extended it would be wise to
plan to modernize and make needed
repairs to your property now 
Any responsible person with a steady
income may borrow for modernization
purposes and repay monthly over a
period of five years W e shall be glad

Next Tuesday the voters o f all voting
precincts will be called upon to
levy taxes for the ensuing year up
until the first o f July 1939 The
state is operating under the budget
bill o f the 1936 37 Legislature and
thereafter it will operate under a
new budget that is now under consideration 
The indications are that
if taxes are to be lowered it will be
necessary as far as practical to exercise
economy at home 
Two years ago additional aids were
given to high schools and it now appears
that material aids to municipalities
will fall by the wayside except
that possibly a rearrangement o f
the gasoline tax distribution may be
made in which case the municipalities
and the county will receive more aid;
the state highway system will receive
less 
During the past week the Wisconsin
Assembly reversed itself on several
important bills First it reconsidered
two bills affecting teachers 
tenure and then engrossed these two
bills one o f which would absolutely
repeal all provisions o f the tenure
law; the other bill would repeal the
law as far as it pertains to rural
one room schools It appears that as
far as the Assembly is concerned 
that teachers tenure will be either
repealed entirely or at least as far
as it relates to rural schools 
The Legislature also reversed its
action on the Fitzsimmons married
women s bill This bill was previously
refused engrossment by the Assembly 
but this week was reconsidered
and engrossed and comes up for
final passage in a week and anything
may happen to it 
A liquor county option made its
first appearance in the Assembly
since prohibition but it was far short
o f engrossment by many votes

TH E PASSE N G ER PIGEON
One o f the greatest mysteries con
nected with American bird life is the
utter extinction o f the passenger pi
geon Many o f us older people look
back with regret on the time when we
were thrilled over the annual advent
and flight o f the pigeon 
The arrival in the spring o f the
year o f the many migratory birds
was always a welcome event and
their songs and warblings lent an exilerating
influence to their coming 
The arrival o f the pigeon however 
was distinguished by a far different
reception The coming o f the song
birds was more quiet and unobserved 
and you awoke in the mornings 
surprised by their carols and warb
ling Not so the pigeons With a
roar as though the very heavens were
in turmoil you looked up to see the
skies from the horizon to the zenith 
and as far as the eye could see 
living mass o f swiftly flying birds 
moving as it were in mass batallions
seemingly eager to reach some coveted
goal It was estimated that there
were billions o f them in the midwest
and in the Northwest Their meeting
places were located where there was
an abundance o f trees and it was
found that often as many as a hundred
pair would build their nests in
a single tree 
The passenger pigeon was distinguished
by his activity and alertness 
its color was a dark slate The male
was marked by a brilliantly colored
breast and an orange colored eye and
stood proudly erect with wmgspread
o i 18 inches When they lu st made
their appearance the craw or crop
was filled with acorns snails and diilerent
Kinds of seeds Later on they
would alight on the farmers fields 
and regale tnemselves with the wheat
which at that time o f the year was
being planted uany a farmer was
obliged to reseed his fields because
of tne depredations caused by tnese
hungry birds ft would be dillicult
to estmiate the vast amount of nour
isnment required to sustain those billion
of birds They flew at a height
o f 500 to 1 0 0 0 feet and made about
a mile a minute requiring in one instance 
three hours to pass a given
point The hunting and shooting of
those birds was great sport and one
that was indulged in by all who possessed
guns and ammunition Shooting
into the flocks as they arose from
the ground always yielded a rich harvest 
Their nests were built o f sticks
and twigs with two eggs to the nest 
lh e male and lemale took turns at
incubating There were those who
took pains to carefully check those
incubating shifts and lound that the
tune occupied by each would be timed
almost to the minute A wonderful 
instinct 
But a ruthless slaughter took place 
The newspapers of tnat time related
the places where by the aid o f nets
and clubs a million of those noble
birds were slaughtered in a single
night with 500 men participating 
lh e birds were shipped to the Eastern
markets Many theories have
been advanced as to what was the
cause of that sudden and utter extinction
of one o f the most virile and
hardy of birds 
However this is not an isolated
case and it is not only the dodo and
the passenger pigeon that have passed
out o f the picture Orinthologists
tell us of several other species of
birds which once were prominent in
bird life that have been exterminated 
And we know that were it not for
the government stepping in to protect
them the American buffalo would also
long since have been exterminated 
One noteworthy change that is especially
noted by the older people is
the fact that a number o f our native
birds which were so numerous in the
early day are constantly dwindling 
and we cannot but wonder if future
generations will miss any o f our
leathered friends as the present generation
is missing the Passenger Pigeon 
When one walks into a museum
and observes the long line o f prehistoric
skeletons such as the Mastedon 
the Mammoth and other exhibits
o f ancient colossal remains he sees
the effect of the inexorable law
which eliminates certain species to
make room for those which can better
carry into effect the coming changes
which nature is constantly effecting 
And if the greater and more pronounced
creatures must go down to
extinctions to be replaced by those
with a more favorable adaptation to
their environment then we can but
accept and bow to the inevitable 
Nevertheless it is a matter o f regret
that we no longer witness that aweinspiring
display which those stately
and magnificent birds evinced in
their aerial migrations

PROUD OF OLD GLORY
I sit here alone sort o f dreaming 
Forgetting almost to do chores;
Wondering if Europe s dictators are
scheming
Th gruesomest yet o f all wars!
The radio brings us their speeches 
The voice seems to break as he
shouts
To his subjects telling he teaches
Help yourself to what s handy
about!
If objections are made by some nation 
He tells o f their military might 
How they could wipe from creation
That noise without scarcely a
fig h t
The throng is spellbound as they listen
While he orally paints them a
scene 
Of the past and how the future glistens 
Rich promises no longer a dream 
The peoples muster more courage 
To keep that old wolf from their
door!
And wonder if and when the day will
come
When they can eat like never before 
I m proud to be an American 
Where red white blue and the
stars
Permit us to vote read write and
say what we wish 
Without fear o f concentration camp
bars 
The radio fans that listen
To Walter Winchell on Sunday
nights 
Tell me their heart like mine beats
fast and loud 
When he mentions the stars and
stripes 
May that flag forever wave 
Over this land o f the free;
We pray no war will make us fight
This grandest flag to save 
Lest someone forget we too have
strength!
The mightiest to be found 
For here race creed class and politics
With the stars and stripes are

OUGHT NOT GO UNPUNISHED
A year ago only one fire out o f
12 508 in Wisconsin was definitely
classed and reported as accidental 
with damages at $425 These fires
cost taxpayers $6 022 964 
If most o f the fires reported each
week could have been prevented presumably
millions o f dollars o f wealth
could have been saved 
I f someone succeeds in robbing a
bank o f thousands o f dollars the police
powers o f the state and the nation
may be called into service to
catch the public enemy If a man
deliberately sets fire to a building
and destroys thousands o f dollars
worth o f wealth a similar situation
is created Every effort is made to
discover sufficient evidence o f arson
and to bring guilty parties to trial 
When an individual who is downright
careless causes a wild fire to
destroy his and his neighbors property 
why shouldn t he be considered
as any other public enemy On the
contrary so often misplaced sympathy
is wasted on him The robber
can be trusted to put stolen money
and wealth back into circulation but
a fire catastrophe caused by the arsonist
or careless individuals definitely
and permanently destroys wealth 
A peculiar thing about it is that the
public must pay for the loss in larger
insurance premiums and higher
cost o f everything 
The farmer has been held liable
for damage by fire if it spreads to his
neighbors land and destroyed property 
Railroad companies likewise
have been held liable for fire spreading
from their right of way 
Why shouldn t the same kind of
liability be extended to the fellow
who is careless in his apartment or
home or in the instance of the tenant
who carelessly keeps his basement 
garage or living quarters littered with
rubbish debris and other fire hazards 
and who allows a defective
chimney to exist on his premises 
Why allow such persons to go without
punishment Landlords who create
over crowded conditions in unsafe
apartments (fire traps) are in the
same category More fire prevention
can be accomplished in some instances
by more inspection and ordinance
enforecement 
In most instances safety education
promotion through the schools and
fire prevention activity by fire departments
and interested parties in a
community will hplp to stop the perpetuation
o f fire traps and other
fire hazards before serious trouble
results The prevention o f fires will
save lives and limbs and dollars for
every taxpayer and citizen 
Last year in Wisconsin some o f the
fire causes listed most often and property
damages w ere:
2X30 adjoining building fires $209 
085 damage
2063 cases o f smokers carelessness 
$265 801 damage
2005 chimneys defective burning out
of sparks $911 420 damage
1298 lightning not rodded $273 799
damage
1060 electric wiring fires $968 139
damage
762 cause unknown $1 281 465 damage
386 cases o f carelessness with matches 
$38 561 damage
207 cases o f children playing with
matches $43 739 damage
142 cases o f defective oil burners 
$163 643 damage
105 cases o f rubbish ignited $30 889

W IN N EBA G O SCHOOL CHILDREN
A P Jones who has been making
a survey o f certain phases o f the
Winnebago Indian problem for the
Jackson county authorities reports
that on March 1st 1939 there were
149 Winnebago children either in the
county or belonging thereto 
Of these children 49 were enrolled
at the Indian Day School at the settlement 
and attending very regularly 
Of the others 29 were attending
the Mission school at Neillsville 13
were enrolled at rural schools seven
were attending high school at Black
River Falls three were attending college 
the Haskell Institute While
exact figures were not available Mr 
Jones says the cost is approximately
$115 00 per student for the school
year Those at the Neillsville Mission
school are costing $185 00 per
student without allowing anything for
the capital investment For the 101
children attending school this means
at a cost o f $11 615 00 none o f which
is paid by the Indian parents 
Two children o f school age were
sick at home and two were in hospital 
This leaves 39 little ones too
young for school and the number has
since been increased by the birth of
the 14th child to one couple Five
children were taken from the county
last summer by state authorities and
these are in institutions There are
several other Indian children in the
county who are state charges and
have not been included with the Winnebago
children 
At the Indian Day school all o f the
children are given a good hot substantial
meal at dinner time each day
and all appeared to be well nourished
and reasonably well clothed The
board having direction o f this school
has decided to make it into a tworoom
school and engaged another
teacher All costs for the maintenance
o f this school is met by the federal
government from appropriations
made by Congress for the purpose 
From the same appropriations comes
the money to pay for tuition and
transportation for the children attending
high school and college

FEEDIN G YOUR BA B Y
 Baby s best food for the first six
months o f his life is his mother s
milk stated the State Medical Society
in a recent health bulletin 
 As soon as the baby is born the
physician should be consulted in regard
to feeding and his advice should
be followed at all times There are
certain rules and regulations attendant
on the procedure o f feeding
which every mother should know 
 The best food for the baby in his
first six or seven months is his mother s
milk but whether the baby s
mother nurses him or whether he is
artificially fed baby especially needs
milk 
 Before the end o f the first month
the baby should also begin to have
cod liver oil or some other source o f
vitamin D If he is given cod liver
oil it should be tested for vitamin D 
It is better to begin giving this at the
end o f the baby s second week especially
if he is artificially fed Except
in exceptionally warm sunny
climates both cod liver oil and sunlight
are needed if the baby is to be
protected from rickets 
 Orange juice or tomato juice
should be given to prevent scurvy and
should be included in the diet of
every baby fed by the end o f the first
month If the baby is artifically fed 
the juice should be given earlier at
the end o f the second week 
 Cooked cereal may be given at
the beginning of the fifth month 
Egg yolk is usually started by this
time although some physicians advise
it in the third month or even earlier 
depending upon the case Green vegetables
should be introduced by the
sixth month Potatoes baked may
be begun at the tenth month but must
not take the place o f green vegetables 
Dry toast or zwieback may be
included after the baby s first tooth
has come Stewed fruit such as apple
sauce or prune pulp may be begun
at the tenth month 
 When the baby is seven or eight
months old the physician should be
consulted about weaning the baby 
and what food to give him Every
baby s diet must be supervised by his
physician

whether they believe that popular
highways need to be hard surfaced 
The county authorities closed No 95
both east and west o f Merrillan last
week The road was broken up
that cars were getting stuck and ai
ing was hazardous 
TH E OSSEO TO U RN EY
Due to the space our account o f
the colored team game takes up we
shall forego a detailed resume o f the
games played at the Osseo tourney
and give only the important factors
o f interest plus the box scores and
present a more detailed story in lat
er issues It will suffice at this time
to say that the Texacos lost in the
finals to Osseo s Senn s oilers in the
playoff game on Sunday afternoon
after Taylor had copped consolation
honors by polishing off Fairchild very
decisively 
We do not believe it would be
amiss at this moment to comment that
we have learned a lot about the Jackson
county ball teams at the tourney
that we didn t know before Take
the Taylor outfit for instance Merrillan
drew them for the first nfght
and when the ball started rolling the
most furious battle o f the tourney
ensued Taylor that night had more
fight than all the teams at the tourney
combined and that s no reflection
on the other teams We have
long yearned to see a team that
 wouldn t be beat Taylor wouldn t
be beat that night and if the Texacos
hadn t been lucky the boys in black
might well have won and gone on to
win the tourney yes we think they
are a better team than the winners
o f the tourney so are the Coca Colas
for that matter Either Taylor
or B R Falls would have been a bet
ter entry for the championship game
than the Texacos and for several
reasons First o f which is that Sun
day s game marked the 4th straight
day o f play for Merrillan having played
the Globe Trotters on Thursday
eve Secondly both the other Jackson
county entrys are accustomed to
playing on a court similar to the Osseo
floor Taylor with their big
League fight would have had the
Senns off balance and crowded their
shots Osseo would have run out o f
gas before the end We believe Arnold
and O Brien with Brown at center
form a better combination in
front than offered by the Oilers
There is no denying that Arnold can t
be stopped on a large floor and when
Arnold is on hand O Brien is dynamite 
Brown always has been able to
hold his own as a threat and handles
a ball very well Osseo would have
been too busy trying to stop this trio
to worry very much about their own
offense Merrillan never did hit their
stride at any time during the tournament
so it would have been just as
well better maybe either the black
or the bold would have had a try at
the top spot As we look at it three
o f the four really classy teams were
furnished by Jackson county The
other top notch outfit being Senns 
We pick Taylor as the fightingest
team the Coca Colas as the smoothest
team Senns as the luckiest and
the Texacos as the deadliest and the
unluckiest The box scores o f the
three games follow 
so

Mr Collum and crew are still
worjring on the former Eid building

GLOBE TR O TTE R S W IN FROM
TE XA C O S 54 TO 47
T he all star Globe T rotters a basket
ball team o f itinerant colored men won
an uphill battle from M errillan s T exacos
by a 54 to 47 score The H om e Oilers
were really in form fo r the first half of
the ball gam e and had the dark visitors
plenty w orried T hat the visitors were w orried
is no joke con trary to the opinion of
some w ho believe that all a traveling team
needs to do is to appear on the cou rt or
the diam ond and the gam e is lost for the
locals There are plenty o f g ood local team s
w h o will with the breaks of the gam e run
th e sox off a team w h ose ch ief stock in
trad e is exhibitionism Take the B R 
Falls baseball team fo r instance we have
talked with travelers who have played them
and the op in ion is alw ays the sam e; with
Rudolph tw irling they are all the com petition
any tra velin g team o r fo r that m atter
m ost o f the m in or leaguers w ou ld care to
handle But th a t s aside from the point 
The T exacos rom ped off to a 17 to 7
lead in the first quarter due to a flash o f
brilliance that exceeded anythin g the co lored
men displayed Their m anager was
gnashing his teeth plenty at this p oin t In
the follow in g spasm the local boys slowed
d ow n som ew hat and the visitors put on the
pressure but not enough o f it to overcom e
the lon g M errillan lead and at h alf tim e
ths tally was T exacos 28 Globe T rotters 26 
In fram e num ber 3 the black men used all
o f the tricks o f the gam e as well as all the
sly trick ery to gain a 40 to 37 edge It
was at this point the m anager o f the visitors
rem arked H ere s h op in g that ball club
o f you rs doesn t h it another streak The
T exa cos with an eye on the O sseo tourney 
and w ith n othing to gain from a victory
over the blacks coasted thru the final
ch apter while the T rotters were doing a
lot o f fa n cy tricks w ith the ball fo r the
b enefit o f the big crow d w hich had assem bled

in the final game o f the tournament 
through a mistake made by the score
keeper 
The sophs led 7 2 at the end o f
the first quarter At the half they
led 14 6 
About this time the seniors started
to get busy and by the end o f the
second half the score was tied 19 19 
The first overtime was a very fast
period and the sophs tied the seniors
in the last 15 seconds o f play to make
the score 27 27 at the end o f the first
overtime 
In the second overtime we find the
sophomores getting two buckets to
defeat the seniors 31 27 
The ketch was that the scorekeeper 
not attending the score book
very closely let the game go on at
the end o f the first overtime when
the score was 27 24 in favor o f the
seniors The score board was not
correct and the teams were following
that 
The game may be played over so
watch for it As it stands the Sophomores
are the school class champions!

The neutrality law is up for repeal
or for amendment which would
amount to repeal It was enacted i
few years ago in response to a pub
lie demand that Congress should pass
a measure which would prevent our
country becoming entangled with fu ture
wars which are always breaking
out over the world It was believed
that if we could keep our war profiteers
from shipping war materials
abroad we would be in less danger
of such entanglements It was not
that form o f embargo so earnestly
desired but as a compromise it was
a step in that direction 
It failed in many instances It sue
ceeded in preventing shipments o f
munitions to the war in Spain It has
failed so far as Japan is concerned 
And it is not broad enough to prevent
our supplying many war inclined nations
from purchasing here the
materials which they needed and must
have to prepare for the European
conflict which now seems imminent 
Our trade has increased in the materials
which nations abroad must
have in order to make ready for war 
In fact there is scarcely a bomb 
shell torpedo or other explosive container
in all Europe which is not filled
with potential destruction made from
our cotton and which is not in part
made o f our metals Fifteen million
tons o f our scrap metal have been
shipped abroad for war materials in
the past three years 
Now it is proposed to eliminate
even some o f the regulations o f this
weak and inefficient neutrality law 
For instance it is proposed to place
our munition factories in the way of
extensive shipments even in wartime 
o f the stuffs which add even
more to the wholesale butcheries of
soldiers and civilians alike such as
modern war fare provides It would
be o f course on the cash and carry 
plan so that our profiteers would
be sure o f receiving pay for their
goods It is not proposed that the act
should be so amended as to provide
the economic methods short o f war 
which the president suggested in a
recent message to Congress Real
neutrality which would serve to keep
our country its people and its resources
from serving in another world
conflict is not proposed in suggested
amendments 
A fter two years o f acrimonious discussion 
the re organization bill has
finally gone to the president for his
signature The bill which passed both
houses bears but limited resemblance
to the sweeping measure which was
defeated in the House last year Possibly
it might be entitled a limited
re organization bill as so many bureaus
and commissions have been
completely exempted from any action
under its provisions And some o f
those so exempted afforded the basis
for the great demand for re organization
a year ago What will happen
when the measure becomes a law cannot
be surmised Under it the president
will have authority to consolidate
and re organize some o f the 125
departments O f course it is too big
a job for one man to attempt and
the president s time is so fully taken
up with important matters that he
will be unabje to give it much direct
attention He will appoint a board or
commission to do the work subject to
his final approval But if anybody
thought the battle over the measure
in the last Congress was a bit hot and
acrid they should await the still bigger
battle when re organization starts
to stir up the heads o f departments
which are to be changed about Previous
experiments warrant the belief
that there will not be one battle but
many Everybody wants economy to
srtart with the other fellow and the
bureau chiefs want re organization to
start and end in some other departments
than their own 
The War department is endeavoring
to organize a plan for the training
o f pilots for the 6000 new army
planes upon which construction will
soon start Planes without expert pilots
will be o f little use in time o f
war Training the flyers will be nearly
as great a job as that o f building the
bombers pursuit and battle planes 
etc It is expected that 21 000 young
men will be enlisted The first step
will be to provide a school fo r teaching
the teachers and then it is proposed
to open many schools for flying
fo r the actual training probably
most o f them at various colleges A
survey o f the colleges is now underway
to ascertain about how many
young men will desire to turn to warplaning
as a career 
Our country s bitter experience in
loaning money abroad was added to
through the conquest o f Czecho Slovakia
by Germany The former country
obtained a loan o f $165 000 000
for rehabilitation purposes after the
close o f the World war It defaulted
in payment o f principal and interest 
as did all the rest o f the European
countries except Finland Still there
was the debt and there was the country
which owed it When the conquest
was completed there were over $80 
0 0 0 0 0 0 in gold in the central banks
at Prague which was carted o ff to
Germany Now there is no country to
pay and nothing to pay with as Germany
declines to assume the indebtedness 
just as it did when it took
over Austria which also owed us
$65 000 000 borrowed to feed its
people erect school houses etc after
the World war The actual debt
o f the two countries which was wiped
o ff the books by recent events in Europe
was $230 000 000 but with interest
added and due the total
amounts exceed $500 000 000 That
great sum exceeds the total amount
o f the farm indebtedness o f the state
o f Wisconsin 
The troubles o f the Treasury are
not confined to losing a half billion
dollars abroad The matter o f $571 
0 0 0 0 0 0 loaned on the southern cotton
crop the past few years gives it
even more concern Now comes the
southern cotton growing states with
the demand that direct subsidies for
cotton for the 1939 crop shall be increased
by another $275 000 000 
Southern senators now have that proposal
before the Senate The payment
would be made at the rate o f 5 cents
per pound Cotton yields from 300 to
600 pounds per acre so the
bonus would amount to from $15 to
HIGH SCHOOL O FFERS AG RIC U LTURE
 FULL Y E A R HOME EC 
The local school board at a recent
meeting approved the introduction o f
agriculture as an elective course o f
study in the high school Such action
is decidedly in keeping with the
current trend in high school offerings
and also reflects the opinion o f a
great many local people 
By offering a course o f study in
agriculture it is possible to secure
federal aid to help defray the cost 
Supt Johnson informs us that such
aid has been assured the district and
that application for it has been made 
The federal aid for the support o f
such a course is equivalent to onehalf
the salary paid the instructor 
and is dependent upon the report of
the supervisor at the end o f the first
year This means that aid for the
course is one year late in arriving 
which makes it necessary for the district
to defray the entire cost the
first year A fter the first year 
however the payment for the preceding
year will help to defray the
cost for the current year 
Agriculture as a course o f study
will be o f interest primarily only to
the rural students but insofar as 60
per cent o f the high school student
body is composed o f rural students
it is entirely justifiable to offer it 
The farmers about Black River Falls
undoubtedly will welcome this added
opportunity for their children and
will be a great factor in making it
a success 
At the same time the board o f education
passed a resolution to place
home economics on a 1 2 month basis
and to request federal aid for this
course also Miss Emma Niendorf 
now employed at the local high school 
is well qualified to carry on this type
o f work and has been offered the position 
Home Economics run on this
plan is a good co partner for agriculture
as the manner in which the
work is carried on is very similar and
just as interesting In one sense it
is more comprehensive than the agriculture
course in that the children
residing in the city have the same
opportunity to receive the benefits
as the children from rural districts 
The introduction o f agriculture and
the extension o f Home Economics in
the local schools was not a hasty decision
on the part o f the Board o f
Educatin or Supt Johnson Surveys
have been carried on in the school
for the past four years and last year
an entire county survey sponsored by
the State Department or Education 
the University o f Wisconsin and Mr 
Johnson was carried out Part o f
this survey was devoted to establishing
the desirability o f introducing agriculture
in the local school

Blair Wis (Special) Funeral
services were conducted Saturday at
3:30 p m from the First Lutheran
church for Mrs Ole Erickson nee
Effie Dora Hjerleid with Rev K 
Urberg officiating Earlier services
had been conducted at North Minneapolis
at 10 a m with the Rev 
A Stensether officiating 
Effie Dora Hjerleid was bom on
January 2 1878 to Sever and Helene
Hjerleid at Taylor Wis on the
the old Hjerleid homestead She
was baptized and confirmed into the
Lutheran faith at the Trempealeau
Valley Lutheran church 
In 1902 she was married to Ole
Erickson Two children were born
to this union: Edna May now Mrs 
George Church o f St Paul; and Ivan
at home in Minneapolis who survive
together with the father 
Mrs Erickson s father and mother
preceded her in death in 1908 and

Twin sons were born March 28th

Mrs R C Gebhardt entertained

$30 per acre Still another plan which
seems to have the sanction o f the Department
o f Agriculture would require
the further expenditure o f $75 
0 0 0 0 0 0 to sell some o f the government s
1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 bales o f cotton at
a loss in foreign countries Added to
the wheat exporting plan at an expense
o f fifteen millions would mean
a surplus dumping plan at a cost o f
$90 000 000 
Congressmen from Wisconsin and
other dairy states o f the northwest
can scarcely reconcile the proposals
for the cotton and wheat programs
with the action o f the Surplus Commodities
Corporation in declining to
make further purchases o f butter to
keep the bottom from dropping from
under butter and cheese prices in the
markets o f our own country Some
$30 000 000 was invested in butter to
stabilize prices It succeeded in holding
the price around 25 to 27 cents
per pound for months Since government
buying has stopped the price of
butter fat has dropped about 2 0 per
cent with the probability o f a drop
o f 15 or 20 per cent more when the
cows go out to spring pasture A
loss o f 30 or 35 per cent will reduce
the buying power o f our dairymen
by $50 000 000 or more for 1939 
Prosperity will not be coming our
way through such losses Congressmen
from dairy districts are making
a hard fight to remedy the situation 
thus far without success The explanation
is that the money is not available 
Still the House added another
$116 000 000 to the war preparations
account as the Senate was passing the
$358 000 000 war plane bill

The Taylor A C basket ball team
entered the tournament at Osseo with
seven other teams and ended by receiving
third place On Friday we
played Merrillan and lacking Peterson
who was stuck over at Disco in the
mud were defeated by a score o f 34
to 41 The teams were very well
matched but the Taylor boys just
couldn t hit that hoop as regular as
these Merrillanites 
For Taylor H Waller led the scoring
with 16 points followed by Thurston
with nine Christy led Merrillan s
scoring with 13 points followed by
Benson with 9 
Saturday night the 25th Taylor
played the Osseo Commercial team
and there was Peterson at forward
and Waller at center going through
the Osseo defense like water through
a funnel gathering 2 0 points each and
helping pile up a score o f 50 to 38 
The game was not up to par as the
difference in the strength o f the two
teams 
On Sunday afternoon Taylor met
Fairchild for consolation honors and
easily tramped them down the second
half by a score o f 42 to 2 2 The boys
were slow in getting started and at
the quarter the scoreboard showed 3
to 3 the half time 14 to 10 The
rest period put the boys in fine shape
by outscoring 27 to 19 at the 3rd
quarter The boys were pretty well
bruised skinned and sprained by the
three day workouts It was whispered
around the tournament that three
o f the Taylor boys gained berths on
an all star team
