         <p>MINNEAPOLIS MILLERS
TO PLAY B R F MERCHANTS
Many people have gotten the impression
that the ball season has been
closed but now it appears that there
will be another game at the fair
grounds this season And what a
game! Manager Rudolph and yours
truly have been negotiating with the
Minneapolis Millers an American Association
ball club for a game here
as soon as the playoffs are completed
in that league Judging from a radio
report heard here Saturday the game
will become a reality Announcements
will be made as soon as the arrangements
are definitely completed 
The exhibition will give our baseball
fans a chance to see several future
M ajor League stars among whom are
Butland and Hash mound artists 
who go to the Boston Red Sox and
Pofahl who is slated to perform for
the Washington Senators next year 
All three o f these men have been
highly advertised in almost every big
daily newspaper in the country thruout
the past season It will be a rare
chance to see the best baseball has to
offer The local management is already
making plans to accommodate
from three to five thousand at the
fair grounds Watch for announcements

TOMAH INDIAN SCHOOL
The Wisconsin legislature has authorized
negotiations for acquiring
the Tomah Indian school property by
the state o f Wisconsin This matter
has received a lot o f agitation during
the past few months 
The proposition most in favor
seems to be to exchange the Veterans
psychiatric hospital at Madison for
the school property and to convert it
into a Veterans Home to relieve the
congestion at Waupaca 
The writer has had decidedly different
views about the matter ever
since the closing o f the Tomah Indian
school some six years ago The Hayward
Indian school was closed at the
same time and the proposition is for
the state o f Wisconsin to accept these
two properties in settlement for the
Swamp Land claim the state has had
against the federal government for
the past 80 years The properties to
be used by the state for such purposes
as they were the best adapted
for T he government acquired all o f the
Indian lands in what now constitutes
the state o f Wisconsin by treaty in
1838 A fter these lands had been
surveyed Congress passed the Swamp
Land Act giving to Michigan and
Minnesota as well as Wisconsin all
o f the swamp lands in those states 
In 1856 the Indians becoming a
problem in northern Wisconsin Congress
passed special acts creating the
present Menominee reservation and
the Lac du Flambeau Rad River and
Lac Court Orielle reservations for the
Chippewas All o f these reservations
contained swamp lands belonging to
the state o f Wisconsin Practically
ever since the matter has been in litigation 
the Indians have never received
the lands to which they were
justly entitled and the state has received
no compensation 
Some years ago a tentative settlement
was arrived at on the basis o f
$1 115 000 as the amount being due
to Wisconsin on account o f the lands
taken Compromise propositions have
been offered in settlement but none
accepted The writer suggests that
the state accept the Tomah and Hayward
Indian school properties entire
in full settlement o f its swamp land
claim against the federal government 
A P J 
S A F E T Y
We are feeling greatly encouraged 
Official o f the safety department o f
the State Highway Commission who
conducted the auto drivers safety
tests at the County Fair informed us
that more persons took the tests at
our fair last Sunday than at any
other fair where the tests were given
excepting only the State Fair in any
one day This we regard as conclusive
evidence that the people o f
Jackson county are becoming more
safety conscious We appreciate the
courtesy o f the fair officials extended
to those conducting the tests and
for the free use o f the booth We
also thank those who donated freely
o f their time in assisting with the
tests 
Children have a way o f dashing
into streets from the most unexpected
places and at the most unexpected
times the State Highway commission
warns motorists With schools in session
again motorists are warned to
be on guard constantly against striking
a boy or girl who may forget to
be careful 
On Wisconsin s busiest highway
last week cars were passing a State
Highway commission traffic counter
at the rate o f two cars every five
seconds This was an unusual condition 
brought about by thousands o f
vacationists hurrying home before
schools reopened But wherever traffic
is heavy beware o f accidents 
Pedestrians and motorists should triple
their care when traffic doubles 
Boys and girls who ride bicycles
to school should remember that it s
just as important to ride a bike safely
as it is to drive an automobile safely 
In fact Wisconsin laws are the
same for bicycle riding and automobile
driving You have to obey the
same traffic regulations follow the
same laws and keep the same safety
standards whether you ride a bike or
drive a car the State Highway commission
points out Good safe bicycle
riders grow up to be good careful
motorists

PETER PAQUETTE
Peter Paquette died Saturday afternoon 
Sept 26 1939 at Gallup 
New Mexico For some time he had
made his home with his niece Mrs 
G Showalter (Tillie O Connel) and
he died there o f a heart attack He
was 73 years five months and 17
days o f age 
The remains were accompanied to
Black River Falls by B N Barnes 
a brother in law and Mr and Mrs 
G Showalter Funeral services were
conducted by Father Peters at the
Keefe Ness funeral home at 3 30 o clock
Thursday afternoon August 31 
1939 The body was laid to rest in
the family lot by the side o f his
mother in Riverside cemetery 
Mr Paquette was born at Portage 
Wis March 9 1866 the son o f
Moses and Madeline Paquette The
family moved to Black River Falls
some 15 years later and Peter made
his home here until he entered the
U S Indian Service 50 years ago 
He leaves one brother Moses Paquette 
o f this city and one half sister 
Mrs Kathryn Argyle o f Stevens
Point He never married 
The deceased was a conscientious
man o f high moral character and unswerving
integrity He was singularly
devoted to his mother who lived
here until her death years ago His
first consideration was her comfort
and welfare and he contributed materially
to both The following news
story taken from the Gallop Independent
o f Sept 5th tells the story of
his active life 
Navajo* Mourn Paquette a* Friend 
White* Hail Him as First New Dealer
Window Rock (Special) Word of
the death on Aug 26 o f Peter Paquette 
first man o f Indian blood to
hold a Navajo superintendency is
just reaching hinterlands o f the Navajo
country where the long hairs and
old men still greet his name with
reverence 
A strange combination that made a
73 year old veteran Indian service
employee awful good friend to the
old Navajos and still the administrator
to whose regime is credited the
start o f many o f the New Deal policies 
Indians loved him because he understood
their ways 
President Teddy Roosevelt appointed
him commissioner to the Southwestern
Navajos July 1 1908 after
he served seven years as principal
o f Fort Defiance schools under Francis
Leupp who was then Indian commissioner 
In the reford administration under
Leupp and in his own dealings
with the Indians reservation officials
said his policies were New Deal They
credited him with the following 
Advocating conservation o f Navajos 
resources 
Introducing o f Angora goats to improve
Navapos flocks 
Developing arts and crafts particularly
blankets to commercial value 
Waging the fight for Indian medical
attention during the flu epidemic
that resulted in the present Indian
service medical staff (2000 Indians
died) 
Instigation of the first tribal business
council which developed in 1923
into the Tribal council with Chee
Dodgeas chairman 
Sam Ayoo Nalh K neezi one o f the
old time medicine men was bereaved
with word o f Paquette s death 
 I feel awful bad said Sam when
convinced the report was actually
true Old Navajos lost awful good
friend We never will forget him because
he was one man who really understood
us 
Indians told government men how
Paquette bearded two witch doctors
by wearing two spits o f clothes during
a hearing in which they threatened
to witch you if you ll take your
clothes off They however attributed
an attack o f gall stones that necessitated
an operation a long while
later to the witching 
Indian service employes liked the
French and part Indian administrator 
 Paquette turned us loose with six
months to do the job or get fired 
recalled Ray Dunn Indian service
man 
Most o f the basic material for the
Merriam report facts used by John
Collier U S Indian commissioner 
for developing a part o f his program
for the Navajos was obtained by Paquette

funeral were Mr and Mrs G Showalte

WHISKERS NOSE OUT
MERCHANTS 3 TO 2
Robert Teeples a prominent young
brush monkey from over Hatfield
way wished to find out if the chin
verbage worn by the House o f Davids
was the real article or store whiskers
so with two gone and Kleven
waiting on the lanes Robert gave a
robust tug on the collective David
beard The facial adornments were
the real McCoy alright because the
Davids won a sizzling hot ten frame
encounter by a 3 to 2 score Robert s
Sth inning gesture in which he
tested the genuineness o f visiting
beard was a terrific home run blast
which sailed far out over the fence
in left field and pushed Kleven who
had singled earlier into the home o ffice
ahead o f him At the time the
Davids were leading 2 to 0 When
Bob s wallop cleared the fence every
soul (sans whiskers) went absolutely
nerts The way Rudy was going
it appeared that the short stopper s
homer was as good as the ball game 
It would have been except for an
unfortunate play which had to be
scored as an error in the 10th more
o f which later 
Ernie started the game like a house
afire by setting down eight o f the
first 12 swatsmen to face him on
strikes allowing not a hit in the interim 
Velchek broke the spell by
shooting a hit into center but he was
immediately erased trying to steal In
the next chapter the 5th something
happened either to Ernie s control or
the Ump s eyesight because Summers
and Okesen both drew walks the ingredients
o f which were vigorously
questioned Anderson popped to left 
Summers and Okesen moved up a
base when Hoard hit the latter with
a throw trying to pick him off second 
Miner scored the pair with a hit
over second 
This 2 to 0 situation continued until
the last half o f the 8th and there
was nothing in the early part o f the
chapter that made it look as if a
change was coming Rudy was thrown
out by Bass on a sneaker bunt and
Randles flied to Summers Then Kleven
drove out a long hit to right center
but was held to a single by fast
fielding whereupon Oscar Teeples 
boy Robert strode to the plate Bass 
he o f the ebon whiskers tried to trick
Robert with a sly curve but the
youthful swatter ignored it Black
whiskers tried a fast one knee high
and outside and immediately found
out he had made a mistake because
Bobby applied his baseball furniture
thereto with considerable gusto and
the pill came back to earth on a far
side o f the fence When the apple
cleared the fence the folks lost their
composure 
The tie continued until the 10th 
which Bass opened with a hit between
Ellison and Teeples Wilson whiffed
but the aging Tucker still a dangerous
sticker shot a fine hit to center 
Bass raced for third on the play and
Kleven s throw to third caromed off
the hurler s leg and bounded away as
Bass scooted for home with the run
that won the game Velchek drew
a pass but Rudy added strikeouts 14
and 15 on Summers and Okesen 
It was a tough one to lose especially
since the Merchants earned
runs exceeded the opponent s but the
Merchants have nothing to be ashamed
of In reality the Locals appeared
to be the better team all the way
through the ball game A number o f
fine scoring opportunities were wasted
in the early innings Two went to
waste when Cihosz twice fairly knocked
the cover off the ball once in the
second and again in the fourth Hauser s
double opening the 5th was dissipated
as well as Teeples single and
stolen base in the first So again we
say you can t beat breaks

SH AW S NO HITTER CIHOSZS
HOMER BEATS ALL STARS 1 0
Two very pronounced features
marked a game played at the Jackson
County Fair last Monday afternoon 
One feature was the no hitno
run game twirled by Shaw the
able twirling side kick o f Ernie Rudolph 
and the second feature was a
prodigious home run clout by Cihosz
which sailed over the fence in center
field in the second Shaw s no hitter
held the enemy at bay Cihosz
sock kept them down and that is the
tale o f the ball game 
The weather was persistently wet
throughout the ball game being fit
weather only for fish ducks and assorted
amphibia but couldn t be classed
as good stuff for the horsehiding
trade We personally didn t see
the game the Bell Telephone Co having
engaged us for work in a mental
capacity We were rained out o f our
personal endeavor so were free to go
to the ball game but did not fancy
that anybody would be foolhardy
enough to engage in a baseball fracas
with precipitation descending in
the quantities so generous and so we
were at home spinning our well manicured
thumbs while Rome burned 
All o f which is neither here nor
there so back to the ball game In
the process o f letting the all stars
down without a hit the Chukker whiffed
six in the five innings o f play 
Only two o f the foe reached base 
Nehring strolled in the 4th and
Wright who followed Nehring at bat
survived on a miscue in the same
canto 
The Merchants besides Cihosz game
winning homes were credited with
three other bingles The other hits
being off the clubs o f Teeples Shaw
and a lesser knock for only a single
by the guy that won the ball game
for Shaw This Cihosz for the information
o f the public is the same
chap who was with the Philadelphia
Phillies last year and was earlier the
property o f the Cleveland Indians 
So we got prominent people amongst
us

 Poly Phillips a pseudonym name
for a writer who has been taking
trips through this state and which
have been published in the Stevens
Point paper made the trip through
this section on her final trip last
week On this trip she says regarding
this section Highway 95 or
the old Trempealeau Trail is historic
and picturesque Across the Black
river over hill and dale the road
goes Just before reaching Merrillan
you can see Bruce mound on your
left with a ranger station atop This
is one o f the highest spots in the
state being 1 300 feet high After
you cross the tracks at the outskirts
o f Merrillan turn to the left and
drive about one quarter of a mile to
Oakwood park It will be worth your
time to see the romantic old mill with
the water going over the dam Picnic
stoves and tables are provided here
if you wish to stop Then come back
to Highway 95 again and cross a
queer curving bridge on your way to
Alma Center As you leave Alma
Center look to your left for a beautiful
view At Hixton you will pass
lotus ponds where grow those exotic
flowers protected by the government 
At Blair you will find a clean 
prosperous looking town with a pret
ty park along the river s edge Poly
crossed the Trempealeau river so o ften
on this trip that she isn t going
to try and tell how many times she
went over a bridge but at each place
it was pretty and interesting With
the increasing traffic every year thru
out this part o f the state is there any
wonder that No 95 should be hard
surfaced to facilitate the traffic getting
through at all times o f the year 
During the hot weather the man
who usually does not worry about his
business is the ice man But last week
with the temperature up around 100
in the shade Matt Olson stated that
if the hot weather continued much
longer he might not have enough ice
to last the rest o f the season But
the temperature now has gone down
around well anyway a more com fortable
number and he is now taking
it a little easier for he will have plenty
to last the season and please all
customers

CHEMICALS IN WEED WAR
As in other wars chemicals play
an important part in the strategy to
win the weed war 
In planning the final thrust o f the
season against weeds the state department
o f agriculture urges the
use o f sodium chlorate as an effective
weed destroyer While this chem
ical is most effective when applied
late in September and during October
against perennial weeds such as
quack grass Canada thistles and field
bindweed it is recommended that
plans for its use be made early 
 Right now is a good time to stake
out that patch o f field bindweed so
you won t forget it it was pointed
out by Henry Lunz inspector in
charge o f seed and weed control for
the department 
 Measure up the acres you wish
to treat and determine the amount of
chemical necessary Include at least
five or six feet beyond the outside
plants in your measurements When
the times comes to apply the sodium
chlorate be sure to apply it to the
whole area as there may be plants
underground which cannot be seen 
In computing the amount o f chemical 
multiply the number o f square
rods by four for field bindweed and
by three for Canada thistles Lunz
advised 
Where the field can be cultivated 
chemicals are not recommended for
thistles but can be used along fence
rows and in other places difficult to
get at 
Sodium chlorate is now available in
granulated form and does not easily
become hard or lumpy Its application
in dry form Lunz said is just
as effective and is less difficult Simply
measure the area weigh the
chemical and apply evenly 
A few counties and various towns
in other counties pay one half the
cost o f the chemical when used for
noxious weed control Many towns
pay a portion o f the costs o f the
material when it is applied under the
direction o f the local weed commissioner 
WISCONSIN S HEALTH
By Cornelius A Harper M D 
State Health Officer
Our country is gaining control over
tuberculosis at an increasing speed
and this disease appears headed for
the near oblivion in which diptheria
now finds itself This result is certain
to come to pass if the present
campaigning is carried on systematically 
Seeing these two old killers deprived
o f their power to kill along
with smallpox typhoid fever and a
few others gives rise to a fascinating
idea 
Among the leading death causes is
a disease which does not seem to be
particularly associated with old age
in the sense that heart diseases and
cerebral hemorrhage are 
This is cancer our second leading
death cause in Wisconsin 
What if the hundreds o f research
experts who have cancer under observation 
day and night should emerge
with the discovery o f a sepcific which
as a cure or a preventive could cut
down cancer deaths just as Edward
Jenner s discovery o f vaccination
spelled the end o f wholesale killing
by smallpox 
 Nothing that has been announced
to date indicates that this might happen 
Evidence points to the origin of
cancer as a mysterious change that
comes over normal cells in the human
body making them abnormal and
causing a malignant growth Yet a
specific might exist 
The result would be another big
climb in the average at death Our
percentage o f old people would reach
a new high each year There would
be more checker playing than ever
before 
CATTLE TB REDUCED
TO MINIMUM
Madison The incidence o f bovine
tuberculosis in Wisconsin probably
has been reduced to a minimum 
Slightly less than a fourth o f one
per cent o f the cattle tested in this
state under the bovine tuberculosis
program during he last fiscal year
were found to be reactors according
to Dr V S Larson chief o f the
livestock sanitation division o f the
state department o f agriculture 
Fulfilling a systematic retest schedule
carried on by the state and federal
governments the tests were applied
to 806 919 cattle in Wisconsin 
The exact number o f cattle reacting
to the tests was 2 006 or 24 of
one per cent 
In under a new name and a new
staff the news is started for another
year Contributions will be gladly
accepted and carefully considered

The idea o f Co op Centers at the

in New York when the co operatives
in the metropolitan area in co operation
with a number o f regional cooperative
associations in other sections
o f the country provided a place
for giving information on America s
Co operatives Since then Co op
Centers have been established at
many state and county fairs and they
have proven very popular 
A familiar sight to be seen on the
railways o f Canada in the future will
be Co op tank cars purchased recently

when attacking one from the

often it causes the shoe to come

MERLIN HULL S LETTER
The president gave the public another
surprise when he issued his
proclamation calling congress into
session on September 21st It had
been expected that the call would
not be made before October 2d 
But events have been moving rapidly 
The war in Europe is less than
three weeks old although to many
who are intensely interested it seems
that many months How long the session
will last nobody knows The call
seems to be broad enough to permit
much general legislation even remote
from the war situation 
The first test will come upon the
proposed repeal o f the embargo provisions
o f the neutrality act Some
contend that the president will have
ample votes in both houses to accomplish
it Debate in the House probably
will be limited by one o f those
 special rules which under the ancient
House rules enable the leaders
to rush through without much debate
and without any amendment any
measure the administration determines
upon The Senate operates under
more liberal rules and in that
body there is likely to be extended
debate Senator Borah who for a
generation or two often has been a
dominating factor as to our foreign
relations will oppose the repeal of
the embargo and he will have the
solid support of many others of like
views Consequently the frost is likely
to be on the punkin and winter
may be coming along before the question
o f the size and form of our neutrality 
is determined 
There is a wide variance in the
views o f the people as to the cash
and carry provision which would accompany
the proposed repeal o f the
arms embargo and which may be included
in the same bill Without it 
there might be fewer votes for repeal 
If we are going to get into
supplying war makers with the stuff
to fight with even those opposed to
repeal o f the embargo would prefer
the cash and carry restriction even
though it only lessens and does not
obviate the danger o f involvement 
The sinking o f the Lusitania which is
credited with having influenced
America into the World war might
be cited as an illustration o f the cash
and carry policy It was an English
vessel which is alleged to have been
carrying munitions o f war which were
bought and paid for by Great Britain
and it was sunk by a submarine Cash
and carry will afford a regulation 
but whether it would serve to keep
us out o f war may be doubted 
There are still others who believe
that the cash and carry policy should
be invoked as to all commodities as
well as war materials in case the embargo
is raised Even under the
neutrality act as it now is it is possible
to ship to warring countries food
stuffs raw materials of various kinds 
and even some materials which lack
but little o f being made into war
supplies This traffic is now unrestricted
by neutrality regulations It
is even possible that short term credits
may be allowed on such purchases 
How far the cash and carry
policy will be invoked remains to be
seen when the question comes up 
The public is being amply warned
against the propaganda of foreign
nations now involved in war Even
the government itself has taken a
hand in letting people know that the
sentiment o f American people may be
influenced by dispatches from
abroad Prominent news agencies advise
that even dispatches supposed to
be official as to the war are not to
be entirely relied upon inasmuch as
such dispatches are passed upon by
the censors o f the warring countries
before they are allowed to be sent
out The usual claims o f violence 
atrocities false hoods and double
dealing have been very widely circulated 
In the World war the people
had to rely upon the newspapers
very largely as to information on the
war abroad Now millions o f homes
have their radios and the stories are
carried to them direct along with the
extensive news services o f the press
associations Public sentiment sometimes
changes very quickly on such
vital questions as international war 
There are other measures however 
which may prolong the session
o f Congress Undoubtedly the Army
and Navy will be in for further appropriations
for war purposes The
intention is already announced o f increasing
the peace time standing army
to 280 000 men Additional appropriations
o f upwards o f 200 millions
are being suggested as necessary
to bring that about 
It has been disclosed that Great
Britain and Prance are not the only
countries which have been drawing
heavily upon our resources in preparation
for the present conflict Germany
bought extensively up to the
time the war opened Under our
present law permits have been necessary
for the shipment o f munitions
and war materials abroad and such
permits have been freely granted to
all the nations now involved Germany
continued to buy war materials
as well as provisions until the war
actually broke out 
Great Britain and France have orders
for about $125 000 000 o f war
planes on which the American factories
are working Shipment o f these
planes has been interfered with by the
president s proclamation o f neutrality 
Notwithstanding that fact the
factories continue the construction 
and also continue to employ more and
more men to hurry the construction
program Apparently the officials of
those corporations seem to be confident
that congress will raise the embargo
and thus release to the foreign
purchasers the several thousand
planes on which they are working 
Keeping America out o f war is
probably the most important issue before
the people o f our country Were
it possible to have a referendum on
the question the vote undoubtedly
would be ten to one for keeping out 
We have everything to lose at home
as well as abroad were we to become
involved Harking back to the days
o f 1916 we must remember that a
presidential campaign was waged in
which both political parties were
pledged to keep America out o f war 
Notwithstanding that fact within six

Mrs E T Davis receiving guest prize
and Miss Anna Seielstad honors for
high score among the members 
months from the time o f the election 
America had entered the war with
consequences only too well known to
need recital The one way to keep
America out o f war is to keep away
from it entirely There are too many
problems here at home which need
solution for us to be looking upon
the catastrophe abroad as a quick and
sure method o f restoring prosperity
at home We are still suffering twenty
years after the World war from
the kind o f prosperity the World war
brought to us Every day our American
people continue to pay five million
dollars o f interest on our debts 
etc on account o f the World war 
That alone should be a sufficent reminder
o f the importance o f keeping
America out o f this conflict

BRIDGE COLLAPSES
AT NEILLSVILLE
The large steel bridge located
across the stream just below the dam
on Hiway 73 in Neillsville collapsed
Sunday morning A truck hauling
empty milk cans to the condensary
which is located at the southern
end o f the bridge had just reached
the middle o f the structure when it 
gave way From the appearance of
the structure as it lay in the water it
looked as if the girder supporting the
western side gave way first causing
the bridge to swing slightly westward
down stream as it buckled in the middle
and plunged into the water below 
The truck was thrown between some
o f the ironwork o f the superstructure 
part o f which fell upon it pinning
it upon its side above the water 
The driver escaped through the
door on the lower side o f the wrecked
cab and sustained as far as could
be learned only a cut on one hand 
Traffic was routed over the bridge
one block westward It also carries
a warning sign o f 10 000 pounds capacity 
Perhaps this catastrophe may
be the means o f bringing some o f our
unsafe bridges to the attention o f
those who can and will do something
about it How about the bridge on
Hiway 95 at the western edge o f
the village o f Merrillan  It has been
unsafe for many years but still must
carry the traffic that passes over
State Hiway No 95 How much
longer will it support the load

GREAT BIG TURKEYS i
AND LOT OF THEM j
The Black River Falls Produce Co 
began killing and dressing turkey on
Monday They will kill and dress
every other day from now on until
the first o f next January They will
dress from 600 to 800 each day the
approximate number o f birds in sight
for dressing at the plant being
30 000 
This company A H and Judd
Trask have 22 000 birds on six
farms Buttke Bros Alma Center 
have 6 400 The Trask farm with
Clarence Goldsmith in charge has
5 500 the others are on the farms
o f Harry Brewer Springfield Geo 
Upton Shady Glen Harold Dettinger
and John Peterson both o f Northfield 
The raising o f all o f these turkeys
is financed by the Trasks 
Robert Iliff sr has 3 600 and Herman
Rosenbaum 1 000 Then there
are considerable sized flocks at Cataract
and Necedah which will be
brought to the plant for dressing 
To dress and care for the 600 to
800 birds a day requires 26 pickers
and eight others besides the regular
plant force The labor item is an important
factor and o f considerable advantage
to Black River Falls Dressing
commences when the birds are
six months o f age and the time of
hatching is so governed that all birds
will be killed when o f that age Some
o f the young toms at this age weigh
28 pounds the average being from
22 to 24 The young hens are lighter 
although one dressed Monday
weighed 18 pounds and the average
was from 12 to 14 pounds Birds of
this age are the most in demand and
command the highest prices 
The company will ship the first
car load to Boston this week and a
car holds 20 000 pounds o f the dressed
turkeys Present price on the Boston
market for tops is 26 cents The
demand is good in the east before
the holiday season The Tr sks are
also selling a considerable number o f
young birds for breeders Birds for
this purpose have been sent to Pennsylvania 
Minnesota and Montana A
repeat order came from Pennsylvania
this week 
The turkeys raised are what is
known as the broad breasted general
utility birds and were developed in
the far west Oregon and Washington 
Some o f the eggs bought by the
Trasks for breeding stock cost $1 00
an egg They bought 12 000 eggs
for hatching last spring at an average
cost o f 25 cents per egg the remainder
were from their own hens 
About 56 per cent o f the eggs hatch 
Next week Dr Shlimovitz will start
testing the blood from a number of
the turkeys killed and will then send
the samples to St Paul for a retest 
This work is being done in connection
with the poultry department of
the Minnesota Agricultural college
and is along the same lines as the
testing done for bovine T B and
Bangs Disease the purpose being to
develop a more thorough knowledge
o f turkey troubles how to recognize
and prevent them Since commencing
turkey raising the Trasks have
co operated closely with the poultry
departments o f both the Wisconsin
and Minnesota institutions Their
birds have been in remarkable health
this year 
Arrangements are being made for
a one day turkey school at Black
River Falls in November The state
poultry department is making arrangements
for the school and the
school itself is a feature o f the federal
poultry marketing department 
The party in charge o f the school will
be a federal expert from California
who will give demonstrations in grading
turkeys for shipment tell why
they are so graded what type of
dressed birds are in demand and discuss
other problems in connection
with marketing Turkey raisers from
a considerable area will attend this
school Dates for this school will be
annouhced later

PROGRAM AT
NORTHFIELD CHURCH
A program o f great interest will
be given at the Northfield church on
Thursday evening Sept 28 when the
Pigeon Falls cast presents the play
that was such a success there two
weeks ago The play Down Through
the Years written by Mrs S M 
Moe depicts pioneer life in the first
scene and is then in the second scene
as well as the third in our own times 
The unusual but highly effective part
is the pageant which runs through the
second and third act The Northfield
Ladies Aid sponsors this event and
will serve lunch after the program 
A cordial invitation is extended to all

would feel as though someone were
jabbing me with a sharp knife I
heard o f RUX Compound and decided
to try it I can say that RUX certainly
helps me in relieving these
pain attacks I can recommend RUX
highly for what it has done for me 
MR HERMAN KOEHLER
If you are a Rheumatic Sufferer 
if your body is racked with sharp 
stabbing muscular pain attacks that
make life a torment if you roll and
toss through sleepless nights feel
unfit for work or pleasure because
o f cruel Rheumatic Neuralgic or

LITTLE WHITE CROSS
Mrs Sebert Olson sends us the following
poem stating that she cut it
from a paper 19 years ago and requests
its publication at this particular
time Mrs Olson says that many
women are praying that the sweethearts 
wives and mothers may be
spared the anguish the sweethearts 
wives and mothers suffered during the
dark days o f World War No 1 
Little White Cross
Oh little white cross on the field of
France 
Far over a mighty sea 
You have a story to tell perchance 
Come! Tell it all to me 
You seem to be so silent and still 
What do you guard so well 
Standing alone at the foot of the hill 
You have a story to tell 
You re not as cold as you seem little
cross 
You guard a mother s joy 
Buried beneath you is youth s bright
dream 
Asleep with the soldier boy 
Ashes o f a home lie buried there
Beneath your arms o f white 
For you took a loved one in your care
After the long day s fight 
Does it ever seem when the night
winds blow
About the crosses at play
That they bear as they softly come
and go
The strains o f a wedding day 
And does it seem when the poppies
nod
Thru the lonely wood ant} dell
That faintly over the hallowed sod
There echoes a wedding bell 
Doesn t it seem that the stars on high
Are but suns o f a bridal day 
And the night breathes a love that
never can die
Or be lost and buried away 
Oh yes little cross you stand so
still 
But you know what the breezes
say 
And you ll keep his love for her until
God gives her to him some day 
 Rachel Ann Neiswender

A TRIBUTE TO SARAH HELBLING
There s a chair now that is empty 
There s a voice that we hear no more
And the hands that were always so
busy
Have ceased to toil as o f yore 
They are folded so quiet and peaceful
O er a heart that is still and cold 
A heart that lived its life bravely 
Whose courage can never be told 
We are thankful for you dear Sarah 
For your life and your love so true 
For God seldom gives inall the world
Such another friend as you

W H AT VACATIONISTS WANT
The Wisconsin division o f the
American Auto Association has just
released an analysis oi the interests
and demands o i tne vacationists who
visited W isconsin during the past
season it is the lirst statewide survey
ever maue and was obtained lrom
cards lined out by iiu uuu vacationists 
the cards being selected at random 
these vacationists came from 40
states the District o i Columbia Hawaii
and five loreign countries including
Canada Argentine lirazil 
China and Denmark Kxactiy 47 per
cent o i them came lrom Illinois Minnesota
was second but down to 7 per
cent with Indiana trailing with 0 per
cent and Iowa with Vs 
ih e vacationists were interested
in resorts more than in any other
type o i accommodations ih e average
lor live districts was do per cent
and that up to Oi per cent in the
north central district Oi the others
per cent wanted tourist camps or
housekeeping cabins 24 per cent
wanted hotel accommodations 
Black River f alls is on one o i the
main arterials carrying these vacationists 
it is favorably located just
about midway between Madison and
Eau Claire but it if not getting much
of the vacationists money which they
so freely spend From the statistics
given the reason seems to be the lack
o f resorts Certainly we have plenty
o f tourist cabins and hotels 
Forty per cent o f these vacationists
want information about scenic points 
historic spots fishing and hunting
grounds parks and other vacation opportunities 
Black River Falls certainly
has these and o f high quality 
When will some one take advantage
o f the excellent opportunity for a
high class resort on the river above

IN MEMORIAM
In loving memory of our husband
and father who passed away eight
years ago September 16th 1931 
j When evening shades are falling
 And we sit in quiet alone 
In our hearts there comes a longing
If he only could come home 
Friends may think we have forgotten
When at times they see us smile 
But they little know the heartache
That our smiles hide all the while 
In our home he is fondly remembered 
Sweet memories cling to his name 
Those who loved him in life sincerely
Still love him in death just the same 
Sadly missed bv his wife and family

RESOLUTIONS OF CONDOLENCE
Whereas our Heavenly Father has
seen fit to take our dear Pythian Sister 
Sarah Helbling and Mother o f
our Temple to His temple above 
Be It Resolved that Pythian Sister
Temple No 65 extend to her bereaved
family who mourn for her 
our heartfelt sympathy 
To us her voice is silent 
But without temple hall 
We feel her very presence
And her friendliness to all 
Be It Further Resolved that these
resolutions be spread on the minutes
o f our temple a copy sent to the bereaved
family one to the Banner 
Journal for publication and also our
charter be draped for a period of
thirty days 
She was a good and faithful member 
When possible she was always there 
But now when wTe have a meeting
There will be a vacant chair 
She has been our Protector 
How many years I cannot say 
She was chosen Mother o f our Temple
A year ago last May 
On the sunshine committee
She did her duty without fail 
Taking sunshine and flowers 
And sent greetings thru the mail 
She met with us in Equality 
Fidelity Purity and Love 
She ll not answer when the roll is
called 
For she s gone to the Temple above
