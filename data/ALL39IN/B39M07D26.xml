For the first time this season the
Local Horsehide artists had the shingle
applied where it would do the
most good in a style that left little
doubt as to who deserves to win O f
course it required the champions o f
the colored baseball world to accomplish
this little job but the Clowns appeared
to be the better team o f the
two and while several o f their runs
were labeled unearned they would
have been ahead even without tainted
tallies 
Rudolph held the black men to
only seven hits which is a very commendable
job against the caliber o f
the opposition he faced here last
Thursday Even more remarkable is
the fact that Ernie set a dozen o f
the enemy on their ears phlailing at
a third strike That is plenty good
twirling That is why the visitors
weren t kidding when they told us
that Rudy was the tops in the
moundsmen they have met in Wisconsin 
The opinion was also quite
general among the guests that outside
o f the Madison Blues the Merchants
were their toughest opposition
they have met in this state 
The comical visitors became aware
that they were in a ball game when
Hoard pegged out Harra who was
cavorting around second trying to
confuse the infield and thehuner 
Mr Harra instead o f being very fancy
as he intended really felt quite
silly The next snappy piece o f fielding
business came about in the top
half o f the third when a fast double
play was executed on an attempted
sacrifice Another dazzling double
killing erased a scoring threat in the
fifth The colored gentlemen couldn t
seem to adjust themselves to the
fact that the Merchants infield does
a few stylish things themselves so
when Mafike grounded to Ellison 
Harra who was on first tried for
third but Hauser who took Ellison s
peg promptly shot it back to Len
who had presence o f mind enough to
cover third and Mr Harra again was
sunk Harra was involved in a third
double slaying in the fifth when he
had survived on a bobble and was
mopped up with Mafike when the
latter shot a hot grounder to A Slugger
Rudolph who pegged in to Teeples
who in turn heaved it to Hauser
for the third twin murder o f the
game 
The first count o f the tussle was
registered by the Clowning gents in
the second Selassie (remember what
Mussilini did to his namesake ) was
safe on a wild throw by Deadeye 
Teeples Heile swiped second and
cantered home on a hit to left by
Aussa Two more dusky visitors
scored in the third on a single by
Mafike and a triple to right by Tanna 
The last named bird scored on
a passed ball 
A pass to Nyasses (them fellows
have the funniest names) a sacrifice
to Macan and a hit by Harra were
brewed into the fourth run for the
opposing Warriors in the eighth The
last run was one that went over the
fence in the ninth Tanna was the
power behind it 
The lone marker o f the Black Riverites
came in the home portion o f
the 7th which was opened by Teeples
with an infield single Bulging
Biceps was formed by Slugger Rudolph
who eased over to the keystone
bag on a bit o f burglary This situation
put Art s little brother in a
position to perform a heroical deed
in the circumvention o f a shutout 
Ernie smoked a sharp hit to right and
Arthur galloped home 
We may see more o f the Clowns
this year they having asked for another
game here later in the season 
It was a treat to see this shadow
ball business which was an act staged
by the visitors just before the last
half o f the eighth It consisted o f an
infield workout without using a ball 
The absence o f the pellet enabled the
boys to perform some fielding gems
which were a little beyond belief 
same reminding us o f the time we
saw Teeples hit a line drive over
third base then run around the bases
so fast that he was called out because
the ball hit him in the chest
just as he was going into third 
Thursday July 27 the Merchants
will engage in a scuffle with the Pigeon
Falls team o f the Western Wisconsin
League This will be a night
game Sunday evening starting at
8 15 the Black River Falls Merchants
will engage the La Crosse
Merchants Next comes a real treat 
On Wednesday August 2 Ernie s old
team mates o f the Crookston Northern
League Club will perform before
the local folks This game will be
interesting for a number o f reasons 
Beside the old pupil and teacher angle 
there will be a chance to make
a fair rating o f the real power o f
the Black River Falls team We have
maintained that Rudolph s ball club
would stack up pretty well as it in
the Northern League Many have
been inclined to disagree with us 
A fter Ernie sets them boys on their
ears it will be a swell chance to go
around gloating any saying I told
you so

The Chicago American is running
a series o f articles by Herbert D 
Wilson automobile editor on the Superior
National Forest Maps pictures
and well written articles bring
the northern vacation land to life for
those who have been there as well as
those who have not 
On July 15th the second o f the series
appeared with the following to
interest us locally 
 From Grand Marais along 61 to
Duluth and then down 35 to Stillwater
again staying overnight at the
Lowell Inn A fairly early start the
next morning brought us into Black
River Falls at about 12 o clock noon 
 There we left route 12 momentarily
for a six mile trip to Fallhall
Glen where he had a delicious luncheon
in a spacious lodge built on the
edge o f a roaring stream in a delightful
rustic setting 
 This is a most unusual place and
those who are interested in rare
American antiques and a remarkable
collection o f old china and tableware
should try to spend some time here 
at least an hour for lunch If you
want to stay over there is trout fishing
immediately below the lodge with
bass and muskellunge in the Black
river two miles down stream 
 Starting at 1 o clock out o f Fallhall
Glen we returned six miles to
route 12 and so into Chicago the same
evening rounding out one o f the
most scenic and pleasureable summer
tours that we have ever taken

Police in Peoria 111 arrested a
blind man for driving an automobile
the other day Drawing a blind pension
he had no drivers license nor
car license plates He was driving
over a cinder road by the feel o f the
steering wheel and the sound o f the
tires He said he frequently made
a short trip to visit friends at the
end o f the unused road 
Blind persons have too much respect
for the safety o f others to try
to drive on Wisconsin s highways But
the driver who travels the road at
night with only one headlight or with
two bright and blinding headlights
glaring into the other driver s eyes is
showing no respect for the safety o f
himself and others 
Don t drive blind in Wisconsin the
State Highway Commission urges 
Keep both headlights working properly 
and remember to dim in traffic

With his purchase o f the Hamlin

Meyer has become the fourth owner
of the rambling old home built by
William Hull a stone mason and
practical carpenter in 1859 60 and
the property o f the Garland family
since 1893 
At present occupied by the Milan
Halverson family the house will continue
to be rented but it is likely
that Mr Meyer in addition to making
a number o f repairs in the interior 
will also change the home into a duplex 
O
riginally a three room structure 
the house acquired a kitchen and a

near Blair On a 90 degree growing
day last week he set a stake beside
a cornstalk at 7 a m By evening
the com had grown four inches
and by the next morning at 7 o clock
he found additional growth o f 3 
inches making a total o f inches
in 24 hours The measuring continued
for three days the rate o f growth
decreasing on the last day on account

total growth for the three days o f 72

is an organization o f men and
women who know that we live because
others died for us Our
greatest endeavor is to impress the

There was an interesting article on
July 10th in the Fergus Falls Minnesota 
Daily Journal regarding Dr H 
A Anderson brother o f Oscar Anderson 
o f Taylor which will interest
friends here It will not only interest
them but turn them green with envy 
It happened on a Detroit Lake course 
Here it is 
 Shooting the course in company
with B W Ome Carl Eunerrus and
Sever Lohn all o f this city Sunday 
Dr H A Anderson got into a rough
a couple o f times in shooting for the
seventh hole However when about
80 yards from hole No 7 he hoisted
the ball and it rolled into the cup 
In getting set for the eighth hole the
doctor s companions subjected him to
considerable ribbing on the lucky 80
yard shot While the hilarity was at
its height the doctor changed clubs 
made a slice and the ball dropped a
short distance from hole No 8 and
rolled in a hole in one The distance
was 176 yards 
One o f Monroe county s oldest
fishermen Julius Schamens experienced
a thrill which most fishermen

Highlight o f the week for a lot o f
friends and relatives was the visit o f
Bob Perry former Black River Falls
boy who is a sailor in the U S Navy 
Bob hasn t been home for nearly a
year so when his ship anchored at
New York for an extended stay he
boarded a bus and hurried back to
Wisconsin for an all too brief visit 
Since he left last December he has
crossed the continent by train gone
through the Panama Canal twice visited
Cuba and the West Indies taken
part in war manouvers off the coast
o f Africa made a trip around South
America with stops at all the main
ports returned to New York and visited
the Worlds Fair He went
through the worst storm the navy has
encountered since 1919 while going
around the tip o f South America but
says he was so seasick and thoroughly
scared that he doesn t even like to remember
it Crossing the equator
brought him a full share in the initiation
ceremonies and they too were
too painful to be a pleasant remembrance 
He enjoyed the South American
trip very much said Venezuela
was mountainous Rio de Janiero
as beautiful as the travel books tell
us Buenos Aires looked like an
American city transplanted onto the
plains o f Argentina and had real
honest to goodness skyscrapers Chile
had the prettiest girls but he still
thinks American girls are prettier 
Everywhere the automobiles were
new and shiny and prices were unbelievably
low While in New York
he visited Jack Dempsey s restaurant
and the Empire building and he says
the Aquacade at the Worlds Fair is
worth crossing a continent to see 
Life on shipboard is monotonous in
the extreme and even the good food
and movies every night fail to compensate
for the eternal round o f
scrubbing and painting 
But to us farmers and housewives
it didn t sound monotonous at all! We
are certain we could scrub and paint
with a right good will if we could
just get a peek at all those strange
and glamorous places Bob has seen
the past few months 
Miss Alice Christenson who cooks
those good meals at the Krohn hospital 
has sent us recipes before so
we were very grateful for several
new ones she sent in just the other
day

 The Summer Round Up makes it
possible for your child to enter school
next fall in the best o f health the
State Medical Society advises in cooperation
with the campaign o f the
Wisconsin Congress o f Parents and
Teachers to bring about the examination
and correction of physical defects
in children during the summer
months 
 All parents are ambitious for
their children The future achievements
o f the nation depend upon how
successful they are in the fulfillment
o f these ambitions There are three
gifts which it is within the power of
parents to pass on to their children 
1 Good health the most precious
thing any individual can possess 
2 Home education A pleasant 
happy wholesome well rounded home
and social life will enable the child
in later life to gain a proper idea o f
the mental moral religious and material
issues o f life and to live happily
with his fellowmen 
3 A sound school education which
will permit the individual to make the
most o f his opportunities 
 Arguments to impress us with the
importance o f good health are unnecessary
but many o f us are unappreciative
o f the underlying principles
which govern good health or the factors
which lead to its loss Good
health o f growing children depends
upon 
1 The development o f healthy habits
such as adequate sleep rest and
exercise a well balanced diet personal
cleanliness and a healthy mental
attitude 
2 The removal and correction of
existing physical defects such as bad
teeth infected tonsils adenoids poor
vision impaired hearing hereditary
tendencies and others 
3 Periodic health examinations 
 The primary object o f the Summer
Round up is to have each child
examined and treated by a family
physician and dentist so that he may
enter school in the fall in good health 
The preschool age is the age during
which care should be taken to prevent
the development o f defects or to correct
such defects if they do develop 
Every child has the right to have perfect
health when he enters school
next fall If he enters school in good
physical condition he has a much better
chance for normal progress and
for happiness Parents Join the

CONFIDENCE
Paying by check not only gives others
confidence in you but gives you confidence
in yourself 
When you pay bills in cash you
are likely to let yourself get too close
to your bottom dollar Paying by
check on the other hand encourages
you to build a safe reserve
between you and trouble 
It pays to pay by check It s

Considerable m i s understanding
seems to exist among farmers in general
concerning the present Bang s
program and the method o f indemnity
payment 
1 Under the new act the State
participates with the Federal Government
equally in the payment o f indemnity
on a State wide basis (within
or without area tested counties) 
2 Bangs indemnity payments are
made on the same basis as for Tuberculosis
Eradication work 
3 Appraisals are arrived at in the
same manner between owner and the
veterinarian the basis being the actual
current value o f the animal The
Federal and the State law are the
same Each agency pays one third
the difference between the appraised
valuation and the net salvage but
not over $25 00 on a grade and
$50 00 on a registered animal Understand 
these limitations are on
each agency State and Federal and
do not mean that the point payment
shall be circumscribed by these limitations 
Example 
1 Good top grade appraised $85 00
Net salvage 35 00
Difference $50 00
State pays 1 3 o f $50 00 $16 66
Fed Govt pays 1 3 o f $50 00 16 66
Joint p ay m en t $33 32

Now that the proposed repeal o f
the embargo provisions o f the neutrality
law has been postponed until the
next session the congressional leaders
are planning on hurrying the session
to a close Possibly adjournment
may come early next month Had the
Senate taken up the embargo question 
the debates might not have been
concluded before September The
neutrality fight because o f the tension
in Europe has loomed large as
an issue The propaganda has been
liberally spread over the country 
Proponents for and against have argued
and still argue upon whether or
not the danger o f our country be
coming entangled in another Euro
pean mess will be lessened or increas
ed by repeal They will continue to
do so during the congressional recess 
European war masters seem less inclined
to a conflict now than they
were a few months ago They are
continuing to boom our export trade
in iron steel copper scrap metal and
air planes for further preparations 
Odd as it may be they are paying
somebody s cash for what they buy 
though neglecting and refusing to pay
even the interest on their old war
debts Only later will our people
learn just where the cash is coming
from to pay for their purchases 
Our own country is not lagging in
expenditures f r war purposes although
Great Britain with about onethird
our population is spending
twice as much Its bill now runs to
ten million dollars a day for military
and naval purposes while our own
gets by on a scant six millions every
24 hours for the same purposes^ Our
Naval department states that it has
101 warships under construction and
still more to come War preparations
cost a lot and a war even more 
Included in the 101 new war vessels
will be eight battleships Their
cost alone will be in excess o f $600
millions or just about $100 millions
more than the soil conservation payments
to all the states in the Union 
which the eastern press so frequently
mentions as one o f the most upsetting
things to the national budget In
fact the cost o f a single such ship
more than equals all the payments
made under the AAA program to all
the farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota
in the past five years All the
payments to farmers the next fiscal
year will not exceed six per cent o f
the total appropriations o f this Congress 
With a presidential campaign only
a year away the party leaders are not
letting other issues side track measures
o f political value A fter the
elections o f last fall the scandal over
the use of relief funds and relief
workers in the organized politics o f
some states caused a flare up o f no
small dimensions Some prominently
mentioned and criticized were among
the first to declare that Congress
must pass a law against such political
manipulation Numerous measures
were offered but a bill by Senator
Hatch o f New Mexico in which
state the elections scandals loomed
the largest got the poll It was broad
enough to cover not only participation
o f emergency workers in party
campaigns but other federal employees
as well In fact it would serve
to bar from party activities thousands
o f office holders who owe their jobs
to political influence and have for
years been regarded as part and portion
o f party machinery Under the
influence o f public protest against the
scandals o f last year it was slipped
through the Senate with relatively
few votes against it 
When the Hatch bill came to the
House it was sent to a committee
where it was permitted to repose and
slumber for months Various political
reform organizations and the public
press became aroused over nonaction
by the committee It was
brought up for hearing and proponents
o f cleaner politics appeared in
force During the many weeks other
issues crowded in and the party leaders
rather caught their second breath
as to what the Hatch bill might do in
the campaign o f next year Subtle
amendments were offered eliminating
the more severe restrictions in the
bill As so amended the bill has been
reported for passage The fight over
it will be one o f the most partisan
and acrimonious o f any o f the present
session as attempts will be made
to defeat the amendments and restore
the bill to the form in which
it passed the Senate 
The Hatch bill would not deprive
any government worker o f his right
to think as he pleased nor vote as he
cared to It would stop the regimentation
o f such employees under the
control and domination o f party
bosses and their agents It would
serve to lessen the influence o f political
appointees in national conventions 
It would stop the panhandling
by party committees and candidates
for party funds from employees It
would also serve to make dangerous
to manipulators the kind o f election
tactics which made some cities and a
few states nationally notorious for
wrongs committed in primaries and
general elections The purpose o f
those in government service would
not be thwarted in their expressions
by their ballots but it would free
them from the coercive tactics and
methods which have been used by
party organizations for a century or
more since the slogan To the victors
belong the spoils became party dictum 
and bolstering victory by the
 spoils became party custom 
There are nearly a million federal
officials on the pay rolls It is intended
that they shall be protected
from political spoilsmen and henchmen 
and that they shall not be made
a mere part o f political machinery
indirectly financed by tax payers 
money The Hatch bill in its original
form may not be a panacea for
political wrongs and misdeeds but
certainly it would be a big step in
the right direction if it can be restored
to and passed in its original
form 
Still another good bill has passed
the Senate and may pass the House 
this session It would establish a
new committee to control or prevent
the autocratic actions and methods o f
the great bureaucracy which has been
developing in the federal government
for years As some o f the many departments
have grown in size they
have been receiving additional powers 
Mainly vj^der the Civil Service 
and assured life tenure the inclination
o f |lireau chiefs in some
instances h as^ een to regard themselves
as more important than the
people they are presumed to serve In
other words many o f them become
 bossy and arbitrary in their relations
with the public There are thousands
o f honest sincere and sympathetic
people in the federal service
who have fitting recognition o f their
responsibilities but there are others 
suddenly made powerful by their positions 
who assume the role o f smart
alecs and browbeaters upon slight
provocation The average citizen is
helpless in the face o f their orders
or impositions So the Senate proposes
to set up a committee with
power to bring some o f these petty
autocrats to a proper sense o f their
orwn proportion to the grand scheme
o f things a committee which would
give Mr Average Citizen an opportunity
to kick back when imposed
upon And why not 
A delegation o f farmers from Wisconsin 
Minnesota and New York were
in Washington to attend the hearings
before the House Committee on Agriculture
on the bill H R 6500 
which is intended to make dairy
products a basic commodity to be

Monday by Rep Merlin Hull (Prog )
Black River Falls W s that Secretary
o f Agriculture Wallace be authorized
to utilize his bond issuing
power to refinance farm mortgages
threatened by foreclosure 
A proposed amendment to the president s
spending lending bill would
give the secretary this power 
In a statement Hull said the
amendment would enable the secretary
to use portions o f $500 000 000
earmarked in the bill for a farm tenancy
purchase program 
The amendment also would permit
the use o f approximately $612

All Safety Workers were greatly
encouraged when the announcement
was made that there had been a material
decrease in the number o f fatal
automobile accidents during the
year o f 1938 It was hoped that an
era o f safety saner auto driving had
dawned This hope was short lived 
The first few weeks o f 1939 showed
a marked increase in the number of
such accidents and for the first six
months o f the year the number greatly
exceeds those o f 1938 The ratio
o f bad accidents serious injuries and
deaths is now at its worst Every
auto driver should be impressed with
the gruesome record and be careful 
thoughtful o f the safety o f all

the labor and part o f the m aterial W hile
the p roject being contem plated is very in clusive
and takes in practically all the w ork
that w ould be contem plated fo r som e years
to comc the actual am ount o f w ork that
would be done o f course w ould depend upon
the funds available 
The board o f education has installed an
agricultural course to be started this next
sch ool year It is the feeling o f the board
that agriculture is a much needed activity
in our school and that the school district
could be o f real service to the surrounding
rural area by the installation o f such a
course and that ultim ately the operation o f
a g ood agriculture course would reflect its
benefits upon the com m unity 
Mr V ernon Hanson o f Baldwin W iscon sin 
has been hired by the board to take
ch arge o f this departm ent Mr Hanson
com es to us very well recom m ended by the
State V ocational B oard and a personal visit
to Baldwin has con vinced the board that he
has done outstanding work in that com m unity 
and will undoubtedly d o the same for
Black R iver Falls He has already visited
widely in the rural districts o f Jackson
County and has created m uch interest
am ong the rural students as to the p ossibilities
of the course 
T he board also decided to place the hom e
econom ics departm ent under the G eorge
Elsely plan o f operation The departm ent
will be much broader in its scop e than it
has been up to this tim e and should perform
a m uch greater service a t a lower cost
to the school d istrict U nder this plan the
hom e econ om ics teacher is hired fo r a
tw elve m onth period instead o f nine m onths 
D uring the sum m er m onths her w ork c o n sists
m ainly of visiting with the girls previously
enrolled in her course and with the
parents o f these girls During this tim e she
supervises hom e m aking p rojects that the
students carry on at hom e 
Miss Em m a N iendorf the present hom e
econ om ics teacher is well qualified fo r this
w ork and has been rehired to work under
this plan She reported fo r w ork July 1st
and is at present actively engaged in the
work as outlined 
It is necessary to explain to the electors
one point in regard to the tw o courses just
m entioned W hile the federal governm ent
will pay half the salary and traveling expenses
incurred by the teacher in charge o f
these program s they d o not m ake paym ent
until the departm ents have been in operation
fo r one com plete year This m eans of
course that the school d istrict m ust bear
the entire increased costs o f these d epartments
fo r this year as the federal aid will
n ot be forth com in g until the fall o f 1940 
In the future how ever the school district
will receive aid from the federal gov ern m
ent fo r the support o f these departm ents
to the extent o f 50 per cent o f teacher and
tra velin g cost fo r the preceding year This
aid in future budgets will be entered as an
estim ated receipt just as tuition and state
aids are handled a t the present tim e 
D uring the year the board has found it
advisable to gran t the use of the auditorium
 gym nasium fo r oth er than school a ffairs 
E very effort has been m ade to liberally
interpret the law regarding the use o f
sch ool buildings and to m ake the buildings
available fo r all w orthw hile purposes The
building w as used fo r other than school a ffairs
on approxim ately forty occasions during
the school year o f 1938 39 On only
three o f theste occasions was a ch arge m ade
fo r the use o f the building These were
city basketball gam es at which an admission
was charged 
F ollow ing are suggestions fo r im provements
in our school as recom m ended by Mr 
Callahan State Superintendent o f P ublic In struction 
1 A s was stated in the previous report
o f tw o years ago your enrollm ents are very
large per teacher and there is alw ays a
need fo r m ore special attention to help som e
children m ake p rogress A s present this
need is critical and I ask you to supply for
next year an unassigned teacher w ho will
serve w ith special groups o f children w herever
the need is greatest 
2 The school furniture in you r elem entary
school as you know is not in keeping with
the oth er physical im provem ents you are
m aking I hope th a t as fa st as funds are
aviiable room s m ay be equipped in such a
w ay that m odern teaching is m ore easily
carried o n also that seats fo r children
m ay be provided that con form w ith present
standards fo r correct p osture building 
3 V isual education is one o f the m ost
effective ways to im part know ledge W ith
the room available now it w ould n ot be
very expensive to add the necessary equipm
ent to m ake visual instruction possible fo r
you r grades and junior high sch ool a t least 
4 The m ost econ om ical w ay o f givin g
children a w ide basis o f inform ation is to
p rov id e adequate libraries fo r each class
room This need is clear in the m ind o f
you r principal and teachers U ntil a w ider
library equipm ent is available the w hole
instructional program is handicapped 
5 A nother cultural need in you r sch ool is
the lack o f large colorfu l appropriate class
room pictures If one could be secured fo r
each of the prim ary room s at least it w ould
be a g ood start 
6 In a previous rep ort you r attention was
called to the need fo r better facilities fo r
hanging children s w raps This need has
been very well m et in the ju n ior high school
and I believe Principal Johnson is anxious
to extend that type o f equipm ent in an
adapted form to the elem entary grade building 
7 The b ook supply is low in several instances 
although plans are under w ay for
filling these gaps fo r the com ing year In
som e cases the need is so urgent that I hope
additions can be m ade fo r the second semester 
The sp ecific requirem ents for this situation
are clear in the m ind o f you r principal
w ho is very well inform ed on elem entary
school principal s techniques fo r general
adm inistration 
It is the desire o f the board to com ply
with these suggestions an rapidly as p ossible 
and as funds perm it 
The board has given considerable thought
to the p ossibility o f hiring our band instructor
and p hysical education instructors
on a tw elve m onth basis fo r the purpose
o f creating and m aintaining a definite sum m
er recreational program fo r the children of
Black R iver Falls H ow ever again because
o f the financial con dition o f the district it
is the feeling o f the board that such a desire
should first be expressed by the electors
b efore the b o a rd actually attem pts to carry
it out 
The possibility o f em ploying a violin
teacher and school nurse have also been
investigated by the board w ith the same
conclusion reached that the board at this
tim e could not afford to enter into these
activities and thus create a greater financial
obligation on the part o f the district 
There are num erous item s o f equipm ent
and supplies that the board feels are necessary
to the progress o f the school but in
view o f the financial position o f the district 
the board feels that we should fo re g o such
item s tem porarily 
The school board again em ployed the C A 
Bertelson A udit C om pany o f Eau Claire to
audit the books and records o f the board 
All current obligations have been m et all
