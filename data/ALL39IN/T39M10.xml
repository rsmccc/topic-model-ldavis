    aster at Tomah. was c h o s e n tem porary chairm an of ar. organization of
    Monroe county postal employees, ht td at the Hotel Sidney. Sparta, last
    Thursday evening. Visiting m em bers from a sim ilar organization in Jackson
    county outlined necessary procedure, after it w as agreed th at an
    organization of this type would be beneficial in Monroe county and the
    organization was favored by those present. Reservations were made for 67 a t
    a banquet served to postm aster », assistant nostm asters, clerks, city and
    rural "earn ers and ¿h en ladies. Represented a t the m eeting were Sparta,
    Tomah, Norwalk. Wilton, Kendall. New Lisbon, W arrens. Cashton and Clifton,
    besides ! all rural districts. Tomah had 26 I representatives, the largest
    dele- \ gation from any one place. The m eeting was called to com- j plete a
    perm anent Monroe county; organization, detail of which were explained oy Mi
    s. Mae Me j Coy. Sparta postm aster, who pre- j sided at the meeting. Two
    motions were c arried : th at the chairm an appoint a committee to draw up a
    constitution and th at m eetings be held regularly, on the fourth Triursday
    of each month. The October m eeting will be held at Tomah on October 2tt.
    This county organization of postal employees should have a substantial an d
    1 active membership and probably will hav a constructive program of
    helpfulness in the county, both to the pos4al w orkers and to patrons of the
    postal departm ent. There are many problems which confront postal employes
    cont^uouslv and this organization should be valuable in helping to solve
    these questions. It has a definite place in the county and will likely have
    a long and successful caree OAKDALE CO-OP. RECEIVES HUG.E FEDERALGRANT 167
    Miles of Lines Planned in New Project An additional allotment of $161,- 000
    has been maie by the Rural Electrification A dm inistration to the Oakdale
    Co-Operative Electrical Association, it was announced this week. This sum
    will be used in extending the association’s lines into new teirito ry ,
    which will bring electric service to many additional farm homes in the
    section to be served. It is expected th at the new allotm ent will build
    approxim ately 164 miles of new Lne. to bring service to 451 signed members
    m the townships of T o m a h . La Grange, Greenfield, Adrian. Ridge ville.
    Wilton, Clifton and Glendale m Monroe county; Fountain, P lymouth. Wonewoc.
    LÀndma. Summit. Lemonweir. Seven Mile Creek and Lyndon-Kildare in Juneau
    county, and Delona and Winfield in Sauk county. The prelim inary survey for
    this extension has already been taken ] and staking has started. Signed- j
    up members in the new territory are anxiously aw aiting the const# uction of
    the new line that will bring them service, according to Lloyd McCaskey. m
    anager of the Oakdale Electrical Co-Operative Association. W ith the fine
    co-operation being given tne association by signed members and prospective
    members. both in wiring their farm s and homes and m granting right of way.
    it is hoped th a t much of the construction wrork on the new lines can be
    completed this fall. This co-operation is of vital im portance in this
    instance, Mr McCaskey points out, in view of the fact th at in no case can
    REA funds be used in the purchase of right of way These funds are to be used
    in the. construction of member-owned lines only and the right of w ay m ust
    be secured through other sources The Oakdale Electrical Co-Operative
    Association has been in successful operation for several month and the
    service and convenience afforded through this- organization is highly
    appreciated by the farm people in the sections where this service is
    available. Local Ag Students In State Judging Contests TRAFFIC TOLL LOW IN

    in the senate, who paid a fine of $5 and costs on a charge of being ; drunk.
    Mace aroused the suspicion of the local police when he first drove into the
    city and parked his car He realized that the police were suspicious of his
    condition and straightw ay w arned the officers that he was immune to ar
    rest because he w as an assem bly-! man Officer Geoige Gordon was fully as
    emphatic in warning the S5femhlvman th at he would not j be allowed to drive
    his e ar in the city and asked him to wait a couple r f hour. This Mace
    decided not to do and he was taken in bv the officer. City A ttorney Donovan

    City Duck hunters were up bright and t^ rly In this vicinity last Sunday m
    orning to take advantage of the good shooting th a t was presented at Lake
    Tomah and the vaiious reservoirs and marshs in this vicinity. It is reported
    th at m ust of the hunters were fortunate in getting a sizable bag and only
    a few' were unable to get a good share of the game. The ducks at the lake
    were m ostly teal, a sm all variety, but there were large num bers of these
    in the grassy sections at the south end of the lak and num erous ha's were
    said to have been taken. N orth of here in the m arshes and reservoirs,
    there were the larger m allards and many local hunters did wel in those
    sections. Among other w ater fowl a t the lake were a number of large black,
    web-footed birds which have been; variously designated as fish ducks, |
    black geese, corm orant and .several other names th at had nothing to do w
    ith birds. F rank Andres shot one of these sea ravens and j when its stom
    ach w as C u t open, eight good-sized fish were found, i one a »mss nearly
    eight inches j long Sportsm en of this com m un-1 itv hav declared w ar on
    these j fish gluttons and thev will eith er, be driven away or killed.
    'Therej were at least a dozen of these j birds, but there are less now, j
    thanks to some crack shots who are looking for them. INDIANS BEAT VIROQUA
    29-0 Richland Center to Be Opponent on Friday Coach Bizer’s Tomah Indians
    ran up an impressive score of 39- 0 to defeat the Viroqua high school team
    at th a t place Iasi F riday in the first conference game for both teams.
    Tomah dom inated the play a t ail tim es and only once during the game did
    Viroqua threaten. Vi roqua’s opportunity came in the second quarter, when
    Grovesteen fumbled and Viroqua recovered on Tomah’s 35 yard line. Little
    came of this brief advantage. however, and Tomah went on to take the game.
    Tomah made touchdowns in every quarter, twro in the first, one i:i the
    second, two in the third and one in the fourth Lar rabee ac counted for
    three of these touchdowns. Hever for two and Fueh.c for one. H^yer also
    contributed three extra points on line plunges a fte r touchdown. Indicative
    of the comparative stien g th of the two team s, Tomah made 12 first downs
    while Viroqua counted only four. The Indians showed rem aikable improvement
    in all departm ents of the gam; since the New' Lisbon tilt last week and was
    p a rticularly good blocking and defensive work. This team is light in
    weight, but there is plenty of fire and steam back of those pony players and
    a willingness to play the game every inch of the way. which is going to make
    it hard for opponents during the season. Friday the Indian» will play a t
    Richland Center in a conference contest and another hard battle is expected
    when these team s meet. State Report Shows Decrease Over Past Year •
    Although automobile w r e c k s brought death to 61 persons in Wisconsin
    during August, it was the lowest traffic toll registered in any August since
    the state accident reporting law W'as passed in 1935, the State Highway
    commission announces. The m onth has come to be known to s a f e t y w
    orkers as “bloody A ugust,” because of the heavy casualties each year as the
    sum m er tourist season came to an end. In August cf 1937, traffic accidents
    cost 111 lives in W isconsin, the wrorst single m onth in the s ta te ’s
    record. Last year, August brought 72 fatalities. Beside a reduction in
    fatalities of over 15 per cent, serious accidents were reduced from 905 last
    A ugust to 755 this August, while the number of persona injured dropped from
    884 in August of 1938 to 711 in August of 1939 Six counties w ent through
    the first eight months of 1939 w ithout a traffic deeth They were B urnett,
    Kewaunee Lafayette, Pepin, Taylor and Trempealeau, but i fatal accident
    early in Septem ber wiped Trem pealeau county from the honor roll. Monroe
    county reported seven serious accidents to the State Highway commission this
    August, and 11 in August of last year This county had two deaths and three
    injuries this August, comna »ed w»th no fatalities and six injuries in
    August of 193. For the first eight montlis of th is year Monroe county’s
    record shows five traffic deaths. District Lidies’ Aid Societies in

    BREEDERS WILL SPONSOR FIRST BENEFIT DANCE Havlicek’s Orchestra Will Furnish
    the Music The Holstein Breeders’ Association has accepted the responsibility
    of sponsoring the first of a series of benefit dances a t the fair grounds
    pavilion here on Friday night of this week The entire proceeds will be used
    in improving the fair grounds as a community recreation center and the party
    should have the support of everyone in this section who is in terested in
    this worth-w'hile program of community progess. The Holstein Breeders’
    Association will have complete charge of the dance, making ail arrangem ents
    and conducting the party Friday night. A good sta rt was made wrhen
    Havlicek’s popular dance band of La Crosse was engaged to provide the music
    for the occasion. This band is well known for its ability to play both
    modern and old-time music in the way the dancers like it and this insures a
    m ast enjoyable program for both old and young dancers. Anticipating large
    crowds at these benefit dances and determined to provide floor space
    sufficient to accommodate an exceptionally large number of dancers, the m
    anagem ent has arranged for remodeling the fair grounds pavilion, enlarging
    the dancing space more than a third over the rorm er space. This improvement
    will be appreciated by those who have found the pavilion crowded in the past
    and will be a big factor in making the p arty Friday night a success. The
    orchestra platform has been moved to the entrance of the south addition and
    the refreshm ent stan d has been moved into the south addition, devcting the
    entire floor of the main buildmg to dancing space. Additional hardwood floor
    has been laid to cover the entire main building and this will provide a
    gratifying addition to the form er space. Plan to attend this benefit dance
    on Friday night at the fair grounds pavilion and enjoy the p a rty with the
    big crow'd, as well as assist in providing funds to improve the property
    which will I eventually be a fine community recreation center, devoted to
    all sorts of community activities, in which everyone may participate.

    known after the m eeting is organized. A letter from the district gov- j t
    rnor of the Federated Russian Orthodox Clubs, who is located in Minneapolis,
    speaks hightly of the > advantages offered in the TomKh community and he is
    enthusiastic over the prospects of spending a coupl» of days in this city
    and vicinity. It is hoped th at this m eeting will be a grand success and th
    at it will be the m eans of b rirring other large groups to Tornan in the
    future. This is the first j tim e Tomah has had opportunity | to act as host
    to a conventior ofj this sort and everything should be ¡ done to make the
    stay of club ! m em bers in Tomah an event to he : remembered, wit.h the
    hope th at these m em bers w'ill c arry home an J agreeable memory of Tomah'
    ad- i vantages and the city’s hospitality. ______________ TEACHERS HOLD
    JOINT m e e t in g ; Teacher of Adrian and Tomah» townships held their first
    meeting a t the Hill school, Thursday evening. Septem ber 24. Miss Lefa
    Purdy acted as chair- . man of the meeting and appoint-! ed Miss Ruth D
    ettinger secretary j The year’s w’ork was planned j and spelling was
    discussed. Miss Swanson gave m any helpful sug- : gestions. Those who
    attended were Doris Jones, Harley K. Hagen. Bernice j Pergande, Amelia
    Sonnenberg. R uby Heeler. Matilda Bruchhausen, Lefa Purd; Ruth D ettinger,
    Mae O’Leary and Miss Swanson A delicious lunch was served by Miss Purdy. The
    next meeting will be held at the Perry Valley school, October 19. The bill
    had U-en before t legislature, in one form or another, for the past several
    montlis and the battle to bring the bill through both houses successfu’ly w
    as an extended affair and required har : w’ork the p a rt of those back of
    the project. Much uf the t rc > fot the final success of this büi goes to
    Joe Bean, who labored in the interests of the bill since its introduction.
    This project w as originally Included in a blanket bill to cV : - a state-w
    ide increase in the sUiit trunk highway y¿§U-m, w ith provisions to allot
    certain mileag to each county. When this bill w as killed, it w as decided
    to introduce a separate bill, asking foi the addition of 28 miles of
    highway, be tweea Tomah and Babcock, to i¿: sta te trunk system. This bin
    wa^ given final passage last Thursday. HIGHWAY ESSENTIAL In arranging for
    the addition of th is new highway to the state trunk system, the legislature
    has rendered a g reat service to tno traveling public. S tartin g a t th
    Alvin Day farm on highw ay 21, two miles northeast of Tomah, th new route
    runs through Monroe, Juneau and Wood counties 2s ¡ru to Babcock, affording
    an essential connecting highway between t.v • im portant population centers
    the state. Most im portant m th fact th a t this new highway connects with
    various traffic lanes on either end wrhich provides for c o n venient travel
    to numerous populated centers. Located on the abandoned right of-way of the
    valley division oi the Milwaukee road, this n route is straight, and level
    and v. ; be easy to m aintain. Much o f th construction work lias a ire ar
    been done and normal mai a tena; operations w’l i condition th- hu - way for
    traffic uses. Just h soon th’ sta te highway d e p a r t m ent wall
    undertake mam tenar; of the new highway is not knov but it is assumed th at
    its respor, bility will begin immediately on th at steps will be taken a t
    ore to make the route serviceable. F U T I RE P O S S IB IL IT e Not only
    will th is im portant highway render valuable serv : to travelers between
    the at mentioned centers of population but it appears destined to play im
    portant p art in providing c • - venient transportation facilit > to m
    ilitary interests of the s ’ Two large m ilitary camps. Camp McCoy and Camp
    Williams, ai ~ conveniently located near th - south end of th is highw ay i
    troops moving from a doz»n c tral northern cities will find rout essential
    in tim es of moi - zation. Military authoritie h .v been enthusiastic o ^ r
    the pr ~ pects of acquiring th iF tra s s p ta lion advantage and it assumed
    will be utilized during the next period of mobilization. It has been pointed
    out th at tInconvenient route would be of p^i ticular importance in any p
    sible m ilitary emergency, when (Continued on Page 4) School Board

    WILL BE AT INDIAN CREEK CHURCH O tto Baganz of Fond du Lac, Wis., one of the
    leading harpists Of the country, will appear in eonc tr t on Oct. 13, 1939,
    at 8:00 p. m. in St. P e te rs Luth, church, In dian Creek of whicn the Rev
    Mr. Frederic Gilbert is pastor. Th» general public is cordially invited. No
    admission will be cbarged, but a free-will offering will lie taken to rem
    unerate the a rtist and his assistants for their services. Mr. Baganz is
    widely acclaimed a very talented and skilled m usician. Through many y ears
    eu faithful study and application h • has acquired a brilliant technique on
    an instrum ent which is kruswn to be one of the most difficult to master. He
    began playing the harp at th “ age of nine years. He is a pupil of Enrico
    Tram onti, who is recognized to have been one of the world’s greatest
    harpists and of Edmund Sçhuackr. a gtn at chorale harpist of yesteryear. For
    seven seasons he studied under and worked with Joseph Vito of Chieago. He
    now specializes in church music and during the past four years has made
    extensive concert tours in some tw enty different states. H holds the'
    distinction of being till- only lining Lutheran Chorale H arp ist A ssisting
    the harpist in his concerts ar\j his son Reiiben ivitn the Cathedral Marimba
    and Miss Rhoda T rapp with V ibiaharp and Cathedral Symphony Chimes.
    Together with Mr Baganz they con stitu te The Baganz Trio. Their ensemble
    has very largely been pronounced an excellent combination with strikingly
    beautiful ton color, splendidly adapted to their program s in which they
    feature chorales, hymns and religious m usic Of more than passing interest
    is the instrum ent which Mr Baganz owns and plays It is claim ed to be the
    last word in the harpm aker’s art, both aá to construction and tone, arid
    has been term ed “the Stradivarius of haps.-' It was produced especially for
    exhibition at the Cenitfry of P rogress Exposition in Chicago and was there
    shown as '‘the finest harp ever built." It is worthy of note, also th at
    this particular instrument was played for the iltt time, in public by Mr.
    Baganz ,in ¿symphony concert tow ards ;he close of the Chicago World's Fair.
    The Baganz Trio earoes well recommended by people pi omlnent in church and
    musical circles, and no one will ever regret hearing their unique and
    uplifting conceri program m In Paying Final Tribute to your loved ones, you

    or other brancher, of the tederal governm ent. An active program to Induce
    some occupancy of this property has been waged in W ashington, through the
    continued urging of Tomah and Wisconsin croups interested in saving this
    fine plant, but little headway has been gained in this line of endeavor.
    This program oi activity has, however, brought the value of this property to
    the attention of state and federal officials and there appears to be a
    possibility th a t it will be saved to serve many y eais of usefulness,

    IN STATE CONTESTS Over 2,000 Students Compete In The Program The 10 local
    high school ag ricultural students who visited Madison last w e e k .
    Thursday through Saturday, report a mbst interesting and enjc^able
    experience at the capitol city. They were accompanied by A E t W einer.
    instructor in agriculture here, who cared for the boys during their trip.
    Friday the boys were engaged in the state-wide contests a t thfe College of
    Agriculture, in which 199 schools w'cre represente! with 2,300 contestants.
    Some of these schools have had an agricultural ccurse for m any y eats and
    others, like Tomah. are com paratively newr in this branch of education The
    local boys were by no raeaha outclassed in the contests, it was revealed,
    and diu exceptionally well in view of their lack cf experience in th is
    line. Tomah ranked m the 50 top team s in judging farm crops, in w hichthere
    w'ere 130 team s entered. In judging dairy cattle there were 185 team s
    entered and Tomah lanked in the 30 top team s In judging dairy products
    there were 30 team s entered and Tomah ranked »n the top six. Fredrick Waege
    won second place in judging dairy product^; in a field of 90 contestants.
    All of which indicates th at th‘ Tomah departm ent of agriculture is well up
    among the leade^rs in the sta te and, given a bit more experience, the
    representatives ot this school will m ake a splendid showong in the state

    th°se is the provision th at will m ake a $20.00 paym ent per farm possible.
    If the total paym ent for any farm is less than $20.00, th> paym ent which
    may be earned by carrying out soil building practice is increased so th a t
    a minimum cf $20.00 may be earned on any farm. The other im portant addition
    to the 1940 program is the setting up of a separate allowance of $40 00 per
    farm for tree planting. In the past four years very little tree planting was
    paid for under t h e A gricultural Conservation program because the soil
    building allowances were eitner too small or were used up ty seeding and
    liming. Nowr the seeding, liming, fertilizer applications, e r o s i o n
    control and other soil building practices will be credited to the soil
    building goal and up to $40.00 additional payment can be earned by planting
    of trees for windbreaks, shelterbelts, farm woodlots. living snow lences or

    AT MARQUETTE Back a t M arquette university, Milwaukee, for their senior
    year of study there, two Tomah residents have again stepped into the
    foreground as student leaders in the early weeks oi the new school year.

    preparing the first issue of the M arquette Journal, quarterly liteiary

    SIliN S The wire from Senator Wiley was brief, but carried a big load of
    good news to city officials and those interested in the improvement of the
    city. Following is the wire: J. H-nfy, C hairm an Board of Public W orks:
    The president ha approved WPA project No. 40122, to m ake Improvement on and
    along city-owned publie thoroughfare » throughout tbe city of Tomah, in am
    ount, Sug- £ot you c ontact sta te administration at Madison for final a p
    proval, which is dependent upon availability of fuiub and presence of
    certified i f lief labor. AJknuiujnr Wiley The iast sentence applies to the
    general rule of having the s ta te officials of the WfPA office sanction the
    expenditure This, of course, is oniy a m ater of routine and there is little
    doubt but th a t the project will be fully approved by the sta te
    headquarters MANY IMPROVEMENTS This particular project will be devoted to
    the repair and im provement of the city’s stre e ts and will incude a curb
    and g u tte r section, the re-placing of 400 blocks with new street name
    signs, extensive improvem ents on Superior avenue, including five blocks of
    surfacing, relaying of pavem ent and other repairs on the rem aining blocks
    of this im portant through street; relaying the pavem ent brick on McLean
    avenue, repairing Hollister avenue and relaying brick and construction of a
    shoulder on W'illiams street. These are all im portant im provements in the
    city and w ill result in better looking and more serviceable streets.
    CREATES EMPLOYMENT Not only will th is project resu lt in gratifying street
    improvem ents in the city, but a vast am ount of work will be created for
    local w orkers who are now employed in various p a rts of the county. W ith
    this large prospective employm ent of labor, the project will be a benefit
    to the laboring men of the community, and the cost to the city w'ill be
    little or nothing for m aterials. The board of public works has done some
    excellent stre e t work this year and the benefits which will result from
    the proposed improvements. under this spe-t lal WPA project, wil! be
    noticeable. Tomah is fortunate in realizing so much from this public wrorks
    program and all the im provem ents which are oeing made wrill reflect untold
    advantages upon the whole community. o r society Miss Donovan the daughter

    cannot perform efficiently if it is overloaded. You can t expect a one-ton
    truck to corry a five-ton load. Neither should you expect a wiring system
    designed to accommodate the few electrical appliances you had ten years ago,
    to do the bigger job you want your many electrical servants to do today . .
    An adequately wired home provides ample outlets and switches for convenience
    and safety, and can handie the full supply of power to all these outlets. Be

    “gvt o u t” altitu d e but soon made up There was nobody at tbe house sa I
    went along. Mrs. Carey is one of the many correspondents to thia newspaper.
    » A t Alvin Sko^en’s they were digging potatoes. Their potatoes were turning
    out fine. They have a man helping w ith the diggiii; tor a few days. Their
    shredding is done and with the potatoes out of the way they can divert all
    their attention to the fal plowing. Alvin's fath er is plowing while tht
    rest are digging potatoes. Irene, toOf young for school, is helping with the
    potatoes, and says her brother Eldon is going to school Alvin called
    attention to a handy hook on a tree. It is a foot-lift otf an old mow r th a
    t was hung ov er a limn of the tree and left there unnoticed till it had g
    iown into the tiee. He to y s it’s handy to hang things on. 9 Mrs. Fred
    Rubf» had just recently returned from Chicago where she had been visiting
    and said she hadn’t got organized enough as yet to know w hat w as going on
    around the place. She is another m ember of the good staff of correspondents
    of the Journal and Monitor-Hera4l. d. •- Ernest Johnson Ls another farm er
    reporting a good ciop of potatoes. H has about two acres and says they are
    turning out good. Some he had brought in from the field and sorted testify
    a¿ to the good quality of them. He discovered the loss of his pocketbook w
    ith a m onth’s wages In it while I was there. The an x itty over that was
    short, however, as he found it where he had been picking up potatoes. Ernest
    traded spuds for a subscription to the Journal. He says it is the first
    paper he ever t^ol.. He has a lways read bis fa tiler’s paper. At the Scott
    Marsh. Mrs. A. B. Scott reported th a t the crop is good and th at the m
    arket is opening a t a good price so they expect a good return from their
    crop.. She is here from Ashland where she lives, to help out during the
    harvest. Tlu berries are ot good quality and she says the good news from
    their m arsh is tliat the crop is all in the w arehouse. All through this
    section where they nre not through h a rvesting there are thousands of boxes
    of berries piled up for drying. • From here I started for Dannevang with the
    intention of spending the afternoon but ran onto a big potato farm th at of
    A. W Cram pton a farm of 1120 acres. When I arrived they were loading a
    truck. The potatoes are graded as they are loaded. It takes only a few m
    inutes to run them over the grader. The truck loaded while I w as there
    hauls 100 bags of 100 pounds each. Mr. Cram pton has trucks coming from as
    fa r as Dallas. Texas for potatoes. These trucks haul over mx tons. After
    loading the tru ck wc went on a trip over the farm for an inspection of
    several experim ental fields. The first was the potato fields. Another day,
    Mr, Cram pton says, will finish the Tbe sta te has used the Crampton farm
    this Here I ran out of population and had to drive considerable distant I
    followed a telephone truck, assuming they knew where they were going. As
    .soon a s 1 £ot into familia: territo ry again I passed them. The next place
    I came to was thr M. P. Larson farm . Tom W- w orks the place. He woe aw ay
    helping fill silo. • At the Christ Pedersen place, Mrs. Peder sen called
    attention to a novel tree th a t is> seldom seen a prickly locust. It grows
    sharpy pointed net dies with several sm aller needles growing on the mam
    one. Mrs. Pedersen says she isn’t a t all glad th at Ihe tree is there r.s

    bringing new encouragem ent to the dairy farm ers of thw section. The price
    is now higher than it has been for more than a year and indications point to
    a still nigher level. On October 1 the F arm ers Co- Operative B u tter
    Association here paid 31c for b u tterfat in cream and 39c for b u tterfat
    in whole milk. For the October 15 paym ent the price w as 32 for b u tterfat
    in crean» and 42c for b utterfat in whole milk. This is a substantial
    ine'rease over the price of the past several m onths and means much in the
    total income of the farm er patrons cjf the local creamery. It is assumed th

    substantial desn-ease^, which indicates th a t prices should be still
    higher. Inability of foreign countries to get b u tter into the I ’nited S

    this increase in price. Egg prices are also increasing rapidly, another lift

    afte r Death’ is the subject of the Lesson-Serm on w hich will be read in
    all Churches of C h rist Scientist, throughout the w orld on Sunday, October
    22. The Golden Text is: “Blessed is the m an th at end u reth tem p tation:
    for w hen he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord
    hath prom ised to them th at love him ’ (Jam es 1:12). Among the citations
    which comprise the Lesson-Serm on is the follow ing from the Bible: •‘H ear
    th e w'ord of the Lord, ye children of Israel: O Israel, thou hast destroyed
    thyself: but in me is thine help. I will ra n som them from the pow er of
    the grave; I w iü redeem them frcm death: O u \th . 1 w ill be thy plagues:
    O grave, I w ill be thy destruction (Hosea 4:1; 13:9, 14). The I^esson -
    Serm on also includes the following passages from the C hristian Science te
    x tbook, “Science and H ealth w ith K ey to the S criptures” by M ary B aker
    Eddy: M an’s individual being can no m ore die nor disappear in
    unconsciousness than can Soul, for both are im m ortal. Death is but ano th
    er phase of the dream that e x istence can be m aterial. Life is deathless.
    Life is th e origin and ultim ate of man, never attainable through death,
    but gained by w alking in the pathw ay of T ruth both before and u ite r th
    at which is called death” (pp. 427, 487). 2 cups milk 1 cup com I cup grated

    financial loss in merj chandise and equipment was sus I tam ed by H erm an
    Storkel a t the I Tomah H ardw are iast Saturday j night 'or Sunday morning,
    when i burglars entered the store through a rear window and made off with !
    a num ber of valuable item s i It is believed th a t the burglary j occurred
    a fter n ianight and t h a t 1 j it was perpetrated by more than one person.
    E ntrance was gained ; through a rear window into the j work shop a t the
    rear oi the store i and holes bored around the lock j and hooks that
    fastened a con- necting door to gain entrance to the store. The burglars had
    their j own tools to do the work that opi ened the way into the store » Once
    w ithin the store the prowlers made a careful selection of guns, choosing
    eight expensive rifles and two autom atic sh o tguns. The highest priced gun
    was valued at $69 50 and several in the neighborhood of $60 were taken. The
    expensive cash register used [ in the store was also taken, which j
    represents a considerable financial loss There was only about ! $.4 in small
    change in the till and the machmt was not locked, which indicates th at the
    burglars took the machine for re-sale. It was practically new and waa of an
    expensive model. W hether there were other items j taken could not be
    determined by the store force the fore part ol the week. The losses of the
    guns and cash register is more than sufficient, however, and will total
    several hundreds of dollars. A large store light was burning all night and m
    ust have been on when the robbery w as being committed. E ither the burglars
    were well acquainted with the local police activities or were guarded by a
    look-out during tbe raid. The robbery was discovered by Frank Storkel when
    he entered the store early Sunday morning, preparatory to going hunting. He
    first noticed a gun case out of place and then was attracted by the
    half-open re ar door. He called his fath er and a hasty check showed th at
    several guns had been stolen as well as the cash register. No trace of the p
    eipetrators ot this night burglary has been discovered by local officers,
    but every clue is being run dow'n and it is hoped to get a line on the yeggs
    and bring them to justice. The Storkel store was broken into an;J robbed
    three or four years ago, the loot at th at tim e being several guns and
    amunition and knives. The burglar was caught and is serving time. To Leave

    L Disaster Service, Home Nurs- ! ¡ng, Heaüh Education, Keep Thousands Busy
    Wash laiton.—The Rert Croes reserve of regiateied nurse qnaliSed for
    immediate duty is stronger than ere before. Miss Mary Beard, director of the
    American lied Cross nureia services, announced. ‘W'e now have a first
    reserve of 15,# tmmarried ander 40 years of age available for duty with the
    Army. Nary or govemaient nursing servi # s and subjeet to call by the Red
    Cross for disaster work,” she said. “This is 700 more than any previous
    first reserve registration.” Miss Beard pointed out that the increase has
    been gradual and that only registered nnrses meeting rigid requirements of
    training and physical fltness are enrolled. All dasees of nurse reserv • s,
    including nurses now employed by tbe Red Croes, bring the reserve corps
    total to 44.283. During the W'orld War of 1914-18 the American Red mustered
    nearly 20,(100 nnrges for duty with Army, Navy and Red Cr+% hospital», at
    home and overseas. “Maintenance of the Nurse Reserve is provided by our
    charter and is in line with Red Cross nolh cies of prevention and pr#
    parct,ess, but the peacetime work of onr nurses is equally important,” Miss
    Beard said. The director explained that more • 1 ] nurses, chief!}' home
    hygieae and care of the sick instructors, were regularly engaged in visiting
    the sick, aidin physicians In examining school children, conducting
    inoculation programs to stamp out contagious illness, launching trial
    nursing services In oet-of-theway communities, and carrying on important
    health education work to qualify family groups to care for sickness at home.
    AH nurses who are needed for Red Cross nursing activities are drawn from the
    Red Cross reserve of qualified nor.ses. Miss Beard said. Last year Red Cross
    public health nurses made more than one million visits en behalf of the sirk
    and gave skilled care to 272,729 persons. The majority of Red Cross nursing
    services cover entire counties to include both rural areas and industrial
    centers where nursing help is sesree. , Last year, In schools and clinies.
    nurse cooperated with physicians in examining 595,575 children, and aided in
    the task ot correcting defects. Children examined were enrolled for the most
    part in rural schools where this type of preventive service is rare. There
    are 6 Red Cross nurses engaged in this J Wofk in 477 communities. In the
    field of health education, ¡ Red Cross nurc have instructed more than
    l,f00.000 family member sin»-e 4 in how to care for the siefc at home and
    have set new standards of hygiene for the family. Last year the Nursing
    Service held 4,.» classes In home hygiene and care of the sick ar.J awarded
    certificates to €1.2ti persons who paaeed examination. This service to the
    public Is supported by the men and women who • in as members of the Red
    Cross, through their local Chapters, dui the Roll Cali November 11 to 20.

    Costs For Electric Powèr To Do The Family Wash!" “XX’Y DEAR, I never

    lot oi women have—that electricity with all its advantages must be terribly
    expensive. But Bill said he wasn't going to have me ruin my hands and good
    looks—when electric power would do the biggest kind oi a wash for only a lew
    cents. • "Then he got out the electric service bill, checked up on how much
    power an electric washer would use—and proved to me in black on white that
    electricity could save me the usual Monday drudgey at a cost oi less than
    one cent an how. He even proved that the cost of power for a whole hour's
    work was about the same as he pays for one cigarette. "I never will be
    without electricity for my washer—and when you find out yourself how truly
    inexpensive it is. you'll say the same." Ask your neighbor • • • ELECTRIC

    Citizens. Wounded Poles. Refugees, Repatriates Aided Washington —The
    American Red Cross moved qulekly at the onset of hostilities In Europe to
    organize relief for war sufferers and gfve aid to American citiseus stranded
    in dan ger zones oi rescued from sea war fare catastrophe. Red Cross
    offU’ials pointed out that following contact of German Polish forces on
    September 1 the or f tnizarion made available medical •vlief for civilians
    and armies oi Poland; provided aid for Americans repatriating from Europe as
    they Uuded in tlie United States ports; granted medical and maintenance
    assistance to American survivors of the “Athenia,” first sea casualty of the
    war; gave financial aid to the American Hospital in Paris. France, and
    developed a comprehensive communieatione system to allay the fears of
    distraught relatives. Norman H. Havis, chairman, ca b le d the International
    Red Cross Committee in Geneva on September 1 asking what relief would be
    needed from the American Red Cross. In a first step in consolidating Red
    Cross relief forces throughout the nation, 3.700 Red Cross chapters were
    authorized to begin producing refugee garments and to accept con iributtons
    for war relief. A quick response from the Polish Red Cross to Chairman
    Davis’ cable to the International Committee re suited In an American Red
    Cross appropriation of $50.00!» for the pur chase of 4 Items of medicines,
    and for army blankets and a quantity of large hospital tem capable of
    housing 50 stretcher ca ses each. A grant of $25.000 was also made to the
    American Hospital In Paris to evacuate American patients from the hospital
    and to purchase in the I nited States a 100 !>ed hospital unit for shipment
    to the American organization, it was said. To meet needs which were thought
    likely to result from bom bardment of rural villages and the passage of
    hostile armies, the Red Cross called upon 21 of its large city j chapters to
    rU surgical dressings i of a special n^ type for Chi ropes n I warfare
    injuries. More than SOO.OuO j yards of gauze were purchased and $40,000
    pounds of cotton, enough to make 157.000 surgical dressings. On September 2.
    the American Red Cross announced it wa organizing to meet repatriating
    American citizens at seaport cities through chapter reception committees.
    Citizens without resources were given temporary shelter, and aided to re
    settle In their former homes or work. Between September 5 and 7, the
    American Red Cross cabled $2.0.000 through the State Department to help
    American survivors of the Athenia/’ who had been taken into Irish and Scotch
    ports Red Cross chapters were instructed to accept funds for the purchase of
    supplies for impartial distribution end fends for purchase of supplies for a
    designated country to be ex pended through the Red -Cross so city of that
    nation. "The Red Cross is not interested In the origins of the present con
    flic,” Chairman Davis declared fol lowing his cabled offer of assistance to
    the Internationa] Red Cross Com mittee. ‘ As a part of the great Inter
    national Red Cross it is our duty to do hfit we can to aid the helpless
    civiMans who will suffer during the bostilities. TOWNSEND NEWS t
