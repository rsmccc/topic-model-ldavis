    th# munitions m akers for taking Wood money and m ass m urder money, but
    those farm ers who look to w ar only as a m eans to higher prtces are guilty
    of the stmt- dastardly crime. Polish German. French and English mothers and

    of the alignment and aim s of political parties in April of 1S1 and of the
    ensuing nauonal election of th at month Politically the natiun wadi vided
    into several parue with very definite principles, but all of the leading
    parti» held in common three aims: the .lismiisai of the king, the supression
    cf the monarchy, and the establishm ent of some form of more liberal
    government. preferably a Republic. The two leading parties were the
    republicans and socialists, and they, order to wan the e la tio n presented
    a coalition ticket. Many of the monarchists, on account of not having been
    granted an ticipated concessions, )omed t ie coalition. The sm aller parties
    such as the rem nant of the m onarchists the radicals, and the syndicalists
    were greatly outnumbered, and the coalition carried the election by a m
    ajority of seven to . THei with the exception of the district about Maiaga

    This survey of existing conditions in Spam floes not requue a review of the
    battles fought, won or lost, but we must, however, tudy the trail of the
    war. that horrible devestation. We cros¿ from Hindaye on the French side of
    the border to Irun on the Span isfc side. These two cities are less than one
    half mile apart. Trun, at the beginning of the war. was I cd held by the
    loyalists, but they ‘ were forced to surrender after desperate fighting and
    a prolonged stubborn resistance. Almost all of the buaineas section was
    destroy ed, and today there rem ains a row of consecutive blocks in heaps of
    ruins Here and there the four bare w aib ot each of a few builu lTf» remain,
    but the interior and the roofs were destroyed. Th conquering arm y held the
    idea th a t the destruction of the business section and of any strategic
    point would gTeatly the possibility of perm anent reestablishment on the
    part of the conquorered, should they succeed in recapturing lost ground The
    northeastern, east central, and eastern p arts of Spain suffered horrible
    destruction, especially Saragossa, Barcelona. Valencia, and Teruel P a rts
    of Madrid and large sections for miles in all dir cctions of th at city are
    in a state of u tte r devestation. The new U niversity of Madrid, one of the
    best in the world, was started a tew years ago. Today it is a mass of ruins
    and debris, not one building of this one-time fine new plant can ever be ued
    again for school work. The campus, as well as several miles of the
    surrounding country side was used as battlground and is crossed by a network
    ot trenches. For several miles beyond the University, one sees the rem ains
    of many villas, formerly the homes of the well-todo of Madrid. T runks of
    trees are cut off cross grain from two to ten feet above grouiio accordingly
    as bombs or shot from machine guns happened to hit them A few portions of
    walls, still standing here and there, give one an ida e»f the great beauty
    of these homes before the war. Some were constructed of brick, sandstone of
    many colors, tile brick and stone, or just of stone. Hallwsvs and other
    rooms had wainscot of beautiful tiles of many colors The gardens now are
    furrowed with trenches, and a few black stubs are all that is left of rhrubs
    and flowers in many places, as fire finished what bombs and hand grenades
    had apparently respected. Plies of ruins: charred timbers, powdered bricks,
    and jagged walls ¿how what is the result when the fury of hell falls upon
    any beautiful spot. In a few places the trenches are being filled, but for
    mllee, the ruins stand as grim testim ony of what once w ss The owners are
    zone never to return; many were the victims of babarous assassinations. The

    and in production is the parade! of the north central plain. In addition
    there are immense olive groves of several thousand acres in which the trees
    are planted about th irty to forty feet apart. To the extreme south one sees
    the snow-capped peaks of the Sierra Nevada Mountains, with green forests on
    the slopes. Business in Spain is not crippled even though it was harm ed by
    the war. In all of the larger cities there are still a rt shops and some
    fine stores. Merchandise is ot good quality but is expensive Food is
    rationed to the» poor and to those on relief, and it is not unusual to see a
    bread-line several blocks long. In Madrid many of the best and largest
    hotels were commandeered by the Republicans and used as hospitals, but were
    left wrecked at the end of the war. Such was the fate of the Savoy Hotel
    Palace Hotel, and others. The Palace is being repaired, but it waa left in

    IS N EW R E V E N T E B I1X A $14.000,000 increase in income taxes appears
    to be the solution to the Republican adm inistration tax problem. A fter
    months of debate and controversy which at one stage split wide open the
    Republican - Dem ocrat coaliUon, leaders of the two parties have agreed on
    bicadening the income tax base to include more m an 112,000 new taxpayers,
    and Jtirtax increases for all taxpayers. More than that, several P
    rogressives have indicated their approval of the bill, stating th at it is
    the best tax m easure which has yet been introduced The new su rtax levy is
    expected to r a i s e 14 millions which will be augm ented by six million 'O
    tx. raised by a 2c per package cig arette tax. the on;y tax feature th all
    in the bill passed by t h e ! assembly more than five weeks! ago. The 20
    millions still would leave a shortage of about six million to meet b u u ^ t
    require m ents for the next iwo yeari however, the adm inistration hopes to
    make that up w ith economies in sta te government adm inistra tion. D em
    ocrats have insisted th at m ore economies can be effected, and point to the
    Schmedeman adm inistration a t which time the budget was less than 46
    million. Heil’s budget calls for expenditures of about 72 million The new
    tax bas' which cuts down exemptions and increases rates under the surtax is
    expected lo assess 112,000 new taxpayers about $100 to $4.00 each, as well
    as decisive increases for present income tax payers Another amendment to the
    tax bill strik es out the provisions for reenacting the present chain store
    tax. This, observers point out. indicates th a t the adm inistration contem
    plates a new chain store tax bill which will Include all filling statio n s
    The present chain store tax raises sbout $200,000 for the biennium. DAIRY
    TAX REVIVED There is still a possibility th at Wisconsin dairym en will be
    able to join and participate in the national dairy advertising drive T a
    date, Iowa, W’ashington and New York have passed laws which allow for the
    deduction from milk and dairy produce checks fractional am ounts to be used
    in a national cam paign. Minnesota, using a slightly different system, has
    signed up 82 per cent of its dairy farm ers on pledges to raise the
    Minnesota quota. A bill to allow the deduction of one cent for each pcund of
    bu tter fat in Wisconsin has passed the assembly. However, senate opposition
    to the type of bill resulted in the introduction of a new m easure. The new
    senate bill is sim ilar. It would assess farm ers cent per pound for th irty
    days It is expected th at this deduction would raise $200,000 per year for
    advertising and promotional a c tivities. It has been endorsed by the
    committee on agriculture. ThL§ week farm ers have been sending in signed
    statem en ts to the effect th at they are willing to contribute a t the rate
    of cent per pound of bu tter fat for th irty days of each year for the
    advertising of dairy products. (E stim ates are th a t this is about the
    equivalent to ten cents per cow per year ) Lee I. Vorkson, Wisconsin D airy
    Industries Association, urges farm ers interested in the dairy advertising
    progiam to send in their names to the association in Madison in order to
    impress legislators by Their approval. The original assembly bill w as
    opposed on the grounds that farm ers did not w ant to co-operate. POLITICS—Y

    isco n sin ’s three m ajor political I parties have already begun t i round
    their organizations into I shape for the campaign. This week end, S aturday
    an -i Sunday, Young Progressives will j m eet in W ausau, and hope to crej
    ate a perm anent statew ide organ- J ization. Senator Robert La t oil- ¡ctte
    will be the principal speaker. I Young ü o o is already laying the I groundw
    ork for his 1940 cam paign for re-election. Other speakers will include
    Senator Phil Nelson, mentioned as a possible Irogresfflve candidate for
    governor, and Assemblymen Alfonsi and Biemiller, Progressive floor k a d
    ers. Y oung Republicans too get together this week end. They wuli meet in
    Sheooygan on F riday and Saturday. F ran k Gannet, Roches-, ter publisher
    and Governor Heill will be the principal speakers. The Young Dem ocrats were
    the first to assemble They m et in Pelican Lake three w'eeks ago and elected
    John Slocum, present a ssembly clerk, their president. Slocum succeeds foim
    er Assemblyman Cavanaugh of Antigo. LA FO LLETTE R E )K i V N IZATION FIN IS
    Assembly action in concurring with the Bolen’s bill repeals th remaining
    bits of tht La Follette reorganization of state government plan. Introduced
    during the first days of the 1939 session, the repealer wipes out the
    directorship jobs in the public service departm ent, the tax commission and
    abolishes the departm ent of menta l hygiene. All othei La F o iu tt
    reorganization transfers by executive order w’ere abolished during the first
    10 days of the session by senate action. A fter holding the biU moie than
    six months, the assembly concurred and added an amendment which excludes
    from the repeal' r all reorganization bills pass d during the present
    session. Before going to the governor for signature the bdl m ust go back to
    the senate for endorsement of the assembly added amendment. The three
    directors who will lose their jobs if the seuat agrees with the amendment
    and the governor signs the bill art Calmer Browy, public service commission,
    John Thiel, tax commission. and G rant Haas, departm ent of m ental hygiene.
    The abolishment of the department of mental hygiene returns the adm
    inistration of county and state asylums to the state board of control.
    However, a bill to form a new departm ent of public welfare takm g over all
    welfare activities has passed the assembly and aw aits senate action.

    have one-fifth of our nation s ! youth unemployeo' which mean.^ there arc
    four million young peo-' pie between 16 and 24 w ithout j jobs, causing an
    untold economic loss to the nation. One slogan which m any of our graduates

    country column sta rts out this week w ith a correction on the P rescott
    item of two w’eeks ago in wrhieh I stated that the youngest son of Mr. and
    Mrs. A. G. Prescott w as recently married in California. The item should
    have read “the youngest son of Mr. and Mrs. George Pres c o tt” which would
    make him the grandson of Mr. and Mrs. A. G. Prescott, • For lack of apace
    last w k tt was necessary to omit p art of this column. For th at reason
    those items are m inted this week instead of last week. Charlea Kenyon lives
    on the John Nelson farm and says it will be 50 ago on December 22 that he w
    as born there. He hasn ’t lived there all th at time, however. When he moved
    on the place he said it seemed like coming back home Besides his regular
    farm ing Charles Kies truck gardening. At present he has applets and melons

    corn this year. It ».4 on low land so th at it did not suffer from the dry w
    eather as much of our corn fields did. Mrs. Baker ur^etl me to sta y for
    supper but hewing so late I w'ent along leaving our visit only started was
    away, his wife says has a twin brother, William. Mr. Brandenbutg is a gex>d
    sized man and if the brother is equal to him the sto rk m ust have stopped
    several tim es to rest. Most folks know F rank Re'hbeig. I stopped there ju
    st as he returned from Tomah. Mr. Rehberg was secretary of the Monroe County
    .Fair Association for 17 years and took considerable in terest in tairs. He
    still seems to enjoy his memories ot the days when he was active in the

    with his m other, to call on a sick neighbor. Miss K atherine iiettfine

    moved to the M artin Kouniskey place when they finished. • e W'atcr a t the
    Fred Schultz farm . Mr Schultz says, has been hard to get. The windmill fais
    to lun ami he had pumped w ater all the forenoon, fte stated. He was feeding
    a pen ot fine porkers He has hi own silo filler and power so th a t he does
    hi own filling He ha also threshed his own grain until the last year or so.
    He •ays he re^cenUy wrecked an old Case w par a to r th at wa said to be
    over 60 years old. They must have built m achinery good back in th e “good
    old days/ • e s Mr». Carl Br|Bdaburg hat ft sum m er have a good looking-
    corn field. Mrs H art says they have managed to feed their cattle al though
    the pasture has suffered. Shirley knew what h rr name was Out I had quite a
    time getting Marvin to tell what his name. was. He also said the baby’s name
    was Royce Robert B urkhalter is on the old Hale farm . He ami Mr».
    Burkballer, tiie youngsters said, wer1 not a t home. I had quite a tim e
    getting the children’s names. In fact I alm ost flopped entirely. Or, boy,
    who was sharpening a scythe lots larger th an himself, told me his name wais
    ‘ John Brown ask me again e tc /’ You all know' the rest of it. T hat's
    quite a long name but he insisted he h a l no other. One little girl said
    she helps gather the eggs. A fine flower uatden, one of them said their m
    ainm a takes care of. After joking with the kids a few m inutes I told them
    to tell their daddy who stopped and then went on. 0 • At the John Beit
    hauser place John’s right hand man, Eugene, w as hitching the team the stone
    boat which he said he would use to clean the barn because he couldn't lift
    the hay rack off the wagon alone. Stone boats are r a ther handy things
    during a season when wagons are busy with thre\shing, silo-filling and w
    hatnot. Mrs. B etthauser and daughter. Wilda Mae, were busy VVilda Mae had
    been doing some v arnishing. She is rather pleased to be' sta rtin g high
    school tlus fall. • From the Spring Valley comm unity I drove north to
    Tunnel City. Turning to the right I fedlowed tho load along the south siele
    of the Milwaukee railroad, stopping a t the old Ragan farm which is now
    owned by J. C. Reich. John Gerke w orks the place and has been there for the
    past four years. There is a fine orchard in fremt of the house th at is well
    pruned and ordinarily has plenty of apples, Mr. Gerke says. This yea i
    itheee are fewest, ho vs, than usual. The barn is 3Hx 110 feet and a team
    and w^agon wath hay rack on can be driven into the drivew ay and turned a
    round. This saves backing out as is mcessary in must barns. His soy beans
    are raked and ready to haul in and will put the hay mow in good shape for
    the w inter as it is well filled now. At the house one of the girls showed
    us just what kind of a sounding plane she had. I drove intc Ed Houn’ yard
    just in tim e to find him and Albert sta rtin g night chores. Albert was all
    smiles when his dael said he was sta rtin g high school this year. There is
    no silo on the Houn farm but there are tw o com cribs w ith sufficient cairn
    left in them to testify te the success of la.4 year's crop Mr. Houn is
    fee'ding six pigs th at he bought in July a t six weeks old and a crib of
    year-old corn i.s a fine thing for he»g feeding Mr. Houn has remoeleled a p
    a rt of the house into a garage foi his “first c ar’’. His troubles have ju
    st begun One of the boys w as plowing although it W’as rath er dry. One of
    their daughter, Rosa, Mr. Houn said, w orks at W’est Bend, and another,
    Sophia, at La Crosse. As I was about to leave he insisted that I ce»me to
    the orchard and fill my pockets wath apple’s. The trees hang heavy w ith
    iruit. I drove around to see Wm. Krase but found the place descrteel. His
    brother, Richard, later said he thought they were at La Creisee. “B a r has

    Despite the outcome, this will be a good game for the fans to witness and it
    is hoped th at the boys are given the encouragement of a good atten d ance a

    fertilized. P ulting this on an acre basis we find 22 9 bushels compar- j
    county ed with 48 bushels The application of fertilizer on this particular
    field showed an increase in yield of more than 5 0 # . Not only was the
    yield increased but also the food value of the corn itself The fertilized

    September 18, 1938 (yOmpciisation I ’d like to think when life is done T hat
    I had filled a needed post, T hat here and there I ’d paid my fare With more
    than idle talk and boast; That I had taken gifts divine, The breath of lile
    and manhood fine. And tried to use them now and then In service for my
    fellow men. I ’d hate to think when life is through T hat I had lived my
    round or years A useless kind, th at leaves behind No record in this vale of
    tears; That I had w asted all my days By treading only selfish ways, And th
    at this world would be the same If it had never known my name I ’d like to
    think th at here and there, W hen I am gone, there shall rem ain A happier
    spot th at m ight have not Existed had I toiled for gain; T hat sone one's
    cheery voice and smile Shall prove th at I had been worth while; That I had
    paid wath something fine My debt to God for life divine. —E dgar A. Guest

    the huge surpluses of food stocks, for instance. The government was buying
    and giving aw'ay food-stufis to relieve those surpluses. Also it was tapping
    the pockets of ta x payers to subsidize shipm ents ol w heat and cotton to
    other countries which would not buy them at our m arket pnces. Proclam
    ations were issued w arrin g farm ers to cut dowrn production lor next year.

    went Friday. Well, to s ta rt with, I drove south from Tomah until I came to
    the “Y" in the road, H eie I turned to th left past the Robertson place and
    stopped at the U. S. Hancock home. Mi. Hancock w'as getting his com binder
    ready to cut corn for a neighbor. He has two sons, W'ilbur and N avarre a t
    home. N avarre, who is m arried, lives in a separate house. W ilbur w as
    feeding a fine flock ot white pullets. He .says he doesn’t try to get the
    pullets started laying too early as they are apt to stop later and then
    don’t lay any more until toward spring. Finishing the poultry feeding, he
    helped wáth the corn binder till th a t was ready to cut com. Next I sloped
    at the Elm er - tin home but he was away filling silo. His daughter,
    Bernita, who keeps house for him, was a t home. The younger children had
    gone to school. • , The John Boetlinger farm lies across the road to the
    south of M artin’s and is worked by Ernie B urkhalter. Mr B urkhalter had
    gone silo filling but his wafe and m other were home. They are w orking hard
    with the help ot Mr. Boeitinger to improve the buildings. They have m any
    rainyday jobs planned but have had so few' rainy days that the jobs, they
    said, are still w'aiting. Mr. Boettinger has bought a large quantity o f
    commercial fertilizer and lime for the farm and with good farm ing Mr. B
    urkhalter has the fairn into a gooc. stage of pro ductivity. The barn has
    been ce mented and stanchions and stalls are being put in during spar time
    Also an addition of 2b feet has been added besides a fine milk house. Mr.
    Boottinger and the Burkhai ters are looking for a name for their farm

    His farm is called Oak wood Jersey Farm , an appropriate name tx cause of
    the abundance of oak tim ber growing on the farm H had the silo filler set
    up and was getting ready to fill silo. He call ed attention to a gate on one
    of hi box stalls in the batn. If you need one make it like this: on each
    side Of the gate put a pair of stra p iron gate hinges. Then on each side of
    the opening in the pen put a pair of th' sam e kind spaced so th at the
    hinges on the gate wall rest upon them when the gate is put in place. Use
    four old bolts for pins in the hinges. By lifting the pins from the hinges
    on the left side the gate swangs on the right hand pair of hinges and vice
    versa. It is a handy contrivance for separating stock etc. Harold Wacge

    prevailed through the Tomah vicinity that we were persecuting one of our
    former employees by bringing eui bezzelment charges against him without
    cause. Though the wheels el justice grind slowly, and therefore we had to
    wait a long time we were finally able to bring this employee to the bar of
    justice Tuesday. September 12. This employee maintained his innocence up to
    within a few moments of tile time when he would I»; allowed to prove his
    innocence of the charges, when be changed his plea. We now have this as a
    matter of record before the court and restitution will be made’ over a
    |KTiod of years. We have patiently borne a lot the past year and suffered
    much in a business wav, but we now hope the record is publicly made
    straight. WESTKKX SI PIM.Y COMPANY. John W. Kress One of the Largest

    Always buy vegetables in season When vegetables are out ot season they tack
    flavor and are quite a bit more expensive. Cook vegetables In as little wat^

    cauliflower, cabbage and broccoli. These last named foods should be boiled

    ith farm mac h in t^ , h¿y( grain and some livestock were a total loss in a
    fire th at occurred a t the Ode Vandervoit farm , four and one-half miles
    north o f Tomah Sunday evening. H aid w’ork on the part of neighbors saved
    the dwelling and a large chicken house, the only other buildings on the
    place. Included in the lire loss w as a large barr, the main part of which w
    as 36xë4 feet with IS foot posts, and an L. 30x42 feet with 16 foot posts.
    Adjoining the barn was a granary, 24x50 feet, and a milk room 16x18 feet. On
    the m ain floor of the barn w as stored the farm machinery, which included
    two binders, one of them new. ana all so rts of modern machinery to operate
    a large farm . In the loft were something over 30 tons of hay and in the
    granary were approxim ately 800 bushels of grain. In the oarn basement a
    bull, a horse, a num ber of calves and a flock of chickens were trapped in
    the burning stru ctu re before help could release them. The total »oss will
    be considerable and is only partially overed by insurance. The farm is the
    property of Ode Vandervort and is operated by his son, K enreth Vandervort.
    There was none of the family at home a t the time the fire sta rted and no
    theory is given as to the cause1 of the blaze. F rank Vandervort and Pearl
    Shutter, who reside on neighboring farm s, saw the fire at about the same
    time and both rushed to the scene while then waves phoned neighboring farm s
    to spread the alarm. Within a short time there was a large crowfd to assist
    in saving the dwelling and chicken house and their efforts were sue- j
    cessful. Nothing w as rescued from the burning barn, how-ever, | the blaze
    having gained too much headway before help arrived. Th fire was discovered
    at approxim ately 9 o'clock ano raged strong- i ly until afte r II o'clock.
    Mr Vandervort has no plans for the future other than to get j some place
    arrangea for the care of his stock as .^x>n as possible.1 W hether or not he
    will re build the barn could not be learned so soon a fte r the heavy Ixss.

    1921 •SUPER HIGHW AYS The im portant Thorruion highway bill v/hich sets up a
    nine year program c f about 1 W> miles of : late highw ay construction at a
    re st of 70 million dollars has been paased by the assembly and sent to the
    senate. No new appropriat on is necessary under the bill. Each year 2 l ,
    million dollars from state I ighway revenues and 2 million from federal aid
    mor.ey would go into the program . The balance would he made up by counties
    from highway allotm ents they receive from the state, but in nc case is the
    county's share to exceed 00 per cent of the coat. A specified list of roads
    outlined In the» bill m ust be constructed before other new sta te roads can
    be built. A total of 148 projects are listed. Vemoi» Thompson, author of the
    measure, says the program is designed to clos' gaps and replace obsolete and
    inadequate »cads w'hich now carry a large volume of traffic. He declares It
    would give Wisconsin the finest network of highway of any state In the
    union. OYKK-KIDK GOVERNOR'S VOTK The assembly for the first time this
    session over-rode a veto by Governor Heil The vote which needs a tw o-thirds
    m ajority was 50-21. The bill in question would force the sta te rUghway
    commission to m aintain city and village streets which are a p art of a
    etatc highway system . The bill w as backed by the Wisconsin League of Mun
    icipalities and would apply only in villages and citiea having a population
    of 2500 or more. League officials sta te th at the law ghready compels the
    highway commission to m aintain streets in villages and towns with n
    population under th a t figure. MERLIN HULL’S WEEKLY LETTER The president
    gav the public another nutpiise when he issued his proclam ation calling
    congress into session on Septem ber 21. It had been expected th at the cali
    would not be maue before October 2. But events have been moving rapidly. The
    wa. in Europe is less than three u e ek s old, although to m any who a re
    intensely interested it .seems th a t many months. How long the session will
    last, nobody knows. The call seems to be broad enough to permit much general
    legislation even remote from the war situation. the Army and Navy will be in
    for further appropriations for w ar purposes. The intention is already
    announced of increasing the peace tim e standing arm y to 20,000 men.
    Additional appropriations of upwards of 200 millions are being suggested its
    neccssary to bting that about. It has been disclosed that G reat Britain and
    France are not th^ only countries which have been drawing heavily upon our
    resources in preparation for the present conflict. Germ any bought
    extensively up to the time the w ar opened. Under our present law pel m ils
    have been necessary for the shipm ent of munitions and w ar m aterials
    abroad, and such perm its have been freely granted to all the nations now
    involved. G ermany continued to buy w ar m aterials as well as provisions
    until the wfar actually broke out. G reat B iitain and France have orders
    for about $12,500.000 of wat planes on which the American factories are
    working. Shipment of these planes has been interferes wat’a by the
    president’s proclamation of neutrality. N otw ithstanding that fact, the
    factories continue the construction, and also continue to » mp’oy more ' J
    more men to hurry the construction program . A pparently the o fficials of
    those corporations seem to be confident th at congress wjP raise the embargo
    an i thus release to the foreign purchasers the several thousand piaras on
    wrhich they a working. Keeping America out of w ar Is probably the most im
    portant issue before the people of our country. W ere it possible to have a
    referendum on the question the vote undoubtedly would be ten to tional

    Devotions, William Conway: dis The first, test will come upon the ptoposed
    repeal of the em bargo provisions of the neutrality act. Some contend th at
    the president will have ample votes in both houses to accomplish it. Debate
    in the House probably will be limited by one of those “pecial i ules" which
    unde r the ancient House rule enable the leaelers to rush through, w ithout
    much debate and without any amendment, any m easure the adm inistration Th
    Senate opei ates under mor : liberal rules, and in th at body there is
    likely to be extended uebate. Senator Borah, who for a generation or two
    often has been a dom inating factor as to our foreign relations, will oppose
    the repeal of the em bargo, and he will have the solid support of many
    others of like views. Consequently the "fnust is likely to be on the punkin”
    and winter may be coming along before the question of the size and form of
    our "neutrality” is determined. There is a wme variance in the views of the
    people as to the ”cash and carry" provision which would accompany the
    proposed repeal of the arm s embargo, and which m ay be included in the same
    MU W ithout it. there m ight be fewer votes for repeal If we arc going to
    get into supplying! war m akers with the stuff to fight with, even theise
    opposed to repeal of the em bargo would prefer the ‘cash and carry ”
    restriction, even though it only lessens ami does not obviate the danger of
    involvement. The sinking of the Lusitania which is credited w ith having
    influenced America into the World war m ight be cited as an illustration of
    the cash and carry policy. It was an English vessel which i alleged to have
    been c arrying munitions of w ar which were bought and paid for by Great
    Britain and it w as sunk by a subm arine Cash and carry will afford a
    regulation, but w hether erything to lose a t home as \ ai abroad were we to
    become involved Harking back to the days of 1916 we must remember th at a
    piesidential campaign was vageo in which both p iS itw : parties were
    pledged to fr p America out of war. No-. la n d in g th at tact within six
    •• .nth from the tim e of the eb m, America had entered ta r ,r with
    consequences only toc .cål knewn to need recital. ae one way to keep Am e r
    r out of w ar is to keep away f om it entirely. There are too many problems
    here a t home which need solution for us to be looking upon the catastrophe
    abroad as a quick and sure m ethod of restoring prosperity at home. We are
    still suffering tw enty years afte r the World war from the kind of
    prosperity the World w ar brought to us Every day our American people
    continue to pay five million dollars oi interest on our debts, etc., on
    account of the World war. T hat alone should be sufficient reminder of the
    im portance of keeping America out of this conflict. MERLIN HULL. Oriental

    NOTICE The W oman’s Relief Corps district convention will be held October
    3rd at Pardevllle. Cora Heser. Corps Secretary Farmers Urged to Raise More
    Barley F or every acre of barley. It is estim ated th at about nine acres of
    oats are grown in Monroe county The average for the state, as a whole,
    reported by W alter Eblmg of the crop reporting service, is three acres of
    oats for every one of barley. And yet for a quarter of a century barley has
    outyielded oats by 40 per cent In feeding value Gus Bohstedt. in charge of W
    isconsin's program in livestock nutrition, has reminded farm ers throughout
    the sta te th at besides being well adapted to feeding practically all
    classes of livestock, barley surpasses oats per acre in tonnage and in
    actual feeding value. " If we consider th a t a bushel of barley weighs 48
    pounds while a bushel of oats weighs only 32 pounds: and If we consider th
    at a pound of barley has ten per cent more feed value than has a pound of
    oats, we w'ill see th at on the average an acre of barley during each of the
    last 24 years has yielded 40 per cent more feed than has an acre of oats,”
    declares Bohstedt. Yet he points out th at three tim es as many acres in W
    isconsin devoted to growing oats as growing barley. Bohstedt suggests that
    perhaps some of us can afford to forget some of the unpleasant boyhood
    experiences on the farm shocking bailey behind a self-binder on a hot sum m
    er day No longer r.»ed we suffer from the barbs ot bearded barley. The awfns
    have been made smooth for us. thanks to B. D Leith and his colleagues at the
    University of Wisconsin, who by tedious breeding methods have also increased
    the yield of barley per acre. So in spite of possible prejudices and in
    spite of long standing tr a dition of growing cet tain popular crops in a
    rotation m any Wisconsin farm ers will undoubtedly consider barley w'hen
    planning their next spring seeding. Following the ceremony the guests
    accompanied the happy couple to the home of the b rid es mother, where a
    delicious dinner was served. The tables were decorated in blue, pmk, and
    w'hite, with the three-tired w^edding cake serving as centerpiece The white

    reat country, where science stands ready to produce more and more, we have
    more than 20 million people on relief and a vast and increasing arm y of
    unemployed. Poverty in the midst of plenty. W’e have a governm ent on one
    hand paying out vast sum s of money to farm ers not to produce. We are in
    the golden age of production but In the s t o n e ago of economic thought.
    If the Townsend plan were in operation, science could be given a fiee hand
    to create new wealth and fill the country with plenty without restrictions
    because there would be sufficient purchasing power in the hands of the
    people to buy the increased production of foods brought about by science and
    there would be enough work to create jobs for the unemployed What other plan
    than the Townsend plan is there th at will correct t!e deplorable situation
    th at the country is now in What have our reat economists to offer W hat
    have the happy "Jackson Dav diners at $1.00 a plate”, to offer th at has not
    already been tried and failed. Why should a few’ politicians W’ith "rabbit
    horizons” block the program of the science of food I production No wonder
    the Secretary of A gricuiture has the jitters over the agricultural
    situation W'hat will he do w’ith the three or four million farm ers that
    will be rendered unnecessary when the new science of agrobiol- ogy is .•
    free to w oik Fam ines anti food shortages m ay become a thing of the past,
    just as industry was in the last half century freed from the shackles of
    hard-product ion by : science and technology. So the day is now here when
    agriculture \ ’l be revolutionized by the new science of agrobiology The j
    wer can oniy be given by the Tow’nsend plan. The powers of ccienc^ have been

    ELECTRIC POWER ENDS WASH-DAY "BLUES" UT the window go worries and washboards
    when economical electric power comes In. Electric power is a dependable
    worker who asks but the smallest of "wages." It surges through the busy
    little motor on your washer to make your clothes the snowy white envy of
    your neighbors—yet its cost is amazingly low. For the cost of a stick of gum
    it will work merrily for an hour and ten minutes — not only swishing and
    whirling out dirt without wear and tear on clothing — but also turning the
    wringer to save your arms and back. Yes, electric power for washing is cheap
    — and it does have a knack for relieving you of washday worries! WISCOHSIR

    PAVROLL The Tomah shops of the Mil waukee road offer a substantial
    contribution to the prosperity of th is community. There are now approxim
    ately 200 employed at the shops w ith an annual payroll of more than
    $250.000 This payroll has been as high as $375,- 000 annually and it Ls
    hoped th;s level may again be reached, with the return of normal business
    The payroll a t the shops does not include the entire payroll of the
    Milwaukee road in this comm unity by a considerable amount. There is a
    sizable passenger and freight office force, a yard crew, section crews, and
    several train employees who m ake their homes here, all of whom receive
    checks from the railroad company Toman is fortunate in having this fint»
    income to aid in its prosperity. D espite the disturbing financial
    conditions of the past several years, the Milwaukee road has m aintained its
    property exceptionally well and is in a very good position to take advantage
    of the increases in business which are advancing rapidly. This is in
    teresting to Tomah people and prospects for still further in c re a s e in
    local railroad prosperity and expansion are encouraging to everyone in this
    community. Fall Creek IVlen Get Terms For Stealing Wallace Smith, Lloyd

    question, and fhtit dehherutrty fail to comply with reasonable traffir
    teiiitations md fly into a fit of temper if they are even warned .gainst
    infringements of the law. This fallarv of human Hire is strikingly
    exemplified in Tomah everv day dorini; the summer months and is Mill a
    problem to officers in c harge ©f regulations of traffic. A motorist takes
    unreasonable liberties with speed through the heavy down town t s f ^ viuid
    an of iiter question the advh i 4 the driver swears he as i hour and wiw
    really proev i he is arresied for e%ceasive », , , aa.atain a -peed trap and
    that he is 0en^ ueait with. If tio same driver should have an accident he

    ported large sign^ at eonsptcuous inter- ^ak-, setting forth the speed
    limit; warning red fla>her tell th e motorist that there i danger m traffic;
    yet. a driver is sorely abused if an officer stop- him to intimate that he
    is driving a bit too fast. If he is making a mere 1 or T0 miles an hour
    through the city and is arrested, He b e llo w s like a bay steer and vows
    eternal vengeance aeainst the city. Officers, it must be rememiiered. have a
    grave re- 'poiisibility in their position. If a child should fie run down by
    a speeding motorist, the officer has utterly failed to do his duty in
    curbing -peed and reckless driving. It he enforces the law he is accused of
    driving potential b uni nasa aw a y from local tradespeople. If he warns a
    motorist to be careful, he is invitin a torrent of scornful w rath. If he

    those who have, jobs and those who have not. The worker was never more
    insecure than today. He is continually th reate n ed by competition for his

    he would either send his message by a White House employee or come in person
    and read it to the two houses in joint session For many years and until the
    Wilson adm inistration. presidents sent their messages, which were read by
    the clerks in each house separately. Mr Roosevelt ha sent some and delivered

    and return j to the broad bass or Internat ion- j al law, which supposedly
    governed our international relations until | the N eutrality act was passed
    in j 1935. He went back to 1S09 and: cited the Em bargo act Gf \-1 dent
    Jefferson to th point President Jefferson obtained an Embargo act to keep
    our country j out of war between Napoleon and ¡ Great Bruain. Eventually,
    the I W ar of 1812 followed, a id the President mentioned the burning of our
    capitol by the British troop in 1814 as one of the results of President
    Jefferson's em bargo law. He claimed th at to continue the em barco
    provision of our Neutrality law m igln serve to again get us into a foreign
    conflict. He suggested th a t our unemployment question might be relieved to
    some extent by perm itting our industries to m ake anti ship the implements

    fill the vacancy in Congress from the third congressional district, because

    unfortunate that due to Governor Heil's delay in calling a special election
    in our Congressional district following the death of Congressman Griswold we
    of the Third D istrict are not represented in W'ashington. But we have two

    in Europe. Political battle lines are forming in America. The people are
    faced w ith the necessity of m aking an im portant decision which wall
    decide whether America is to have a p art in this m urder and destruction,
    or re main at peace. President Roosevelt, a m ajority of the congressmen, m
    anufacturers of w ar m ateuals, and other profit-seeking mer. form the line
    in favor of changing our N eutrality law so w‘e may sell wat m aterials to w
    arring nations. The La Follettes, Senator Borah, C hirles Lindbergh. Henry
    Ford, and the overwhelming m ajority of the people favor keeping our law as
    it is. and not have a part in this m ass m urder by sellling w ar m aterials
    to any w an in g j nation. Why will it be almost impossible j for us to keep
    out of the w ar if Congress decides to change our N eutralite' Act and sell
    w ar m aterials Because by changing the law we will be taking sides. England
    and Franc: are the only countries th at need w ar m aterials from us and can
    afford to pay tor them. I Are we sure they'll pay for t hem» England is the
    only country th at has the ships to carry the w ar m aterial from our shoi
    es. Why will that get us In the wa r Because Germany has the g re atest
    fleet of subm arines and airplanes. What will we do when she senda her subs
    to New York haibor and sinks our or England s ships loaded with w ar m
    aterial What will we do if German bombers wreck our munition facto ries” We
    will do the sam e thing we did in 1918. Declare war Need we fear German
    bombefs or subm arines if we keep the law as it is and not bell w ar m
    aterials We need have no fear because she would have no reason to harm us
    and thus arouse America against her if w t are not helping her enemies
    Remember, the Congressmen th at are in favor of keeping the law as it is
    wall never vote to ¿;end our hoys to the slaughter house. Those Congiessmen
    th at want to sell w ar m aterials are already taking sides and m ay think
    it necessary for Am erica to enter the w ar Remember England and her Allies
    still owe us 10 billions from the last w'ar. Are we ready to open another
    charge account with her Do you wrant to pay for killing some m other's son
