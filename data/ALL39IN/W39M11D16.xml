Supreme Court Hears Pension
Veto Debate
The question of whether or not a
governor can partially veto an appropriation
bill after the legislature has
adjourned and carrying with it the
final decision as to the increase in old
age pensions and the 10 per cent guaranty
by the state of relief costs to
counties will be decided by the state
supreme court within a month.
Thn state hic-h court heard arguments
on the question last week. Secretary
of state Fred Zimmerman conter
'e that the Governor’s power to
partial veto expires with the adjournment
of the legislature and refused to
publish the bill in the official state
ne'v-nnoer, a step necessary before a
bill can become law. Governor Heil in
turn ordered Attorney General Martin
to petition the supreme court to compe1
Zimmerman to publish the act.
The legislature before adjournintr
had passed an old age pension bill lib-i
eralizing old age pensions from the
now $30 maximum to a $40 maximum.
Because the legislature failed to supply
revenue measures to cover the increased
costs Governor Heil vetoed
sections of the bill which made the
appropriation from the general fund
but signed that portion of the bill
which allowed the increases. Similarly
the legislature passed a relief appropriation
bill of 5 million dollars also
to be taken from the general fund
carrying a proviso that the state pay
10 per cent of the counties relief costs.
Governor Heil vetoed this bill in part
too. striking out the 10 per cent provision.
Attorney Rieser, counsel for Zimmerman,
argued that the statutes require
that the Governor give his
reasons for a partial veto to the legislature
and that when a bill is nartially
vetoed it is still pending and cannot
become law. Assistant Attorney General
Ward Rector as counsel for the
Governor argued that Zimmerman’s
duty in publishing the act is one of
routine and that the secretary o f state
has no authority to pass upon the validity
of laws.
Special Session Talk
Debate over the validity of Governor
Heil’s partial veto of pension and
relief bills and the forthcoming supreme
court decision revives the issue
o f a special session call of the legislature
for the purpose of raising funds
to balance the budget.
Governor Heil has stated that he
intends to postpone a call for a special
session as long as possible. He has
intimated that if the supreme court
upholds his signature of partially vetoed
bills he may be able to avoid
calling the legislators back to raise
new taxes.
Renublican floor leader of the assembly.
Mark Catlin. was in Madison
last week and reported that he had
conferred with the Governor and that
he had urged the executive to call a
special session in order that the state
budsret for the biennium miirht be balanced
as promised in the Republican
platform.
Latest estimates on the amount of
money necessary for balancing the
budaret places the fitrure at about 12
million dollars. When the legislature
adjourned administration leaders announced
that 20 million dollars was
needed. I f the supreme court unholds
the .srovernor’s partial veto 3 million
can be subtracted from that fieure.
Another 4 million can be saved during
1940 by curtailing highway construction
(the governor can legally do this
by refusing to sign hiehway contracts)
and it is estimated that still another
million can be saved by trimming departmental
appropriations.
State Aids to Re Paid
All state aids to counties will be
paid in full, though some may have to
be made on the installment basis,
Governor Heil has said in a letter addressed
to the 71 county boards in the
state.
The letter was written because
there seems to be some question in the
minds of the public whether payments
will be made by the state of all aids
for schools, dependent people, pensions
and funds to local units of government.”
The governor added that the
state “expects and intends” to pay all
these aids.
The law passed by the 1939 legislature
which gives counties $3,079,000
more in aids this year than last year
will be observed, the letter stated, with
the understanding that the money
would be used to reduce taxes.
A slight reference to the Zimmerman-
Heil feud was made when Heil
acknowledged the fact that state aids
for dependent children in October was
12% per cent short. He explained this
by saying that his partial veto of the
pension bill had been questioned (Z im merman
refused to publish it because
he said the partial veto nullified the
entire bill) but that as soon as the
state supreme court decided the status
of the measure the aids would be paid.

Wittenberg Wins Three Opening
Games
Wittenberg High captured its first
game of basketball from Amherst 21-
15. The game was marked bv both
good and poor basketball which one
would expect in the first game. Amherst
appeared a bit over-confident,
which perhaps accounted for their
downfall during the second half. The
“ B” squads of the same schools produced
the thriller of the evening when
their regulation game ended a tie. One
overtime period failed to break the
deadlock and Wittenberg then won on
free throws. Wittenberg also won the
curtain raiser when the local grades
took the Children’s Home boys 5-3.

Death Claimed
Oliver Olson On
Friday Morning
Oliver Olson, a former resident of
this community, passed away in Minneapolis
last Friday morning at 12:45
o’clock after a brief illness, at the age
of 75 years.
Oliver Olson was a native of Manitowoc,
where he was born on August
7, 1864. His parents and six sons
moved to the town of Morris in the
early days, living on what is now the
John Foss farm. The parents passed
away in the early part of the eighties,
and two of the sons, Soren and Ben,
were the first boys to enter the home
that the late Rev. E. J. Homme established
for orphans in this village at
about that time. The older boys went
out and shifted for themselves in various
occupations. Oliver and Severin
were always together, never married
and worked at one time as cooks on
lake vessels. They also spent some
time in various places in the West,
and a few vears ago made their home
ajrain in Wittenberg. Their loyalty
and devotion to one another was a
striking trait of the Olson boys and
beautiful to see. Severin passed away
in Minneapolis a few years ago. Although
we have received no word of
the funeral, it is quite likelv that
Oliver was buried alongside of Severin
in a cemetery in that city. Herman
Olson is the only one of the six
brothers still living. His home is in
Minneapolis. Soren. Ben and Joseph
preceded Severin and Oliver in death
many years ago.

DOMESTIC:
*Arsenal'
*7 am very glad that the bill has restored
the historic position of neutrality of
the i n i ted States."
Thus spake Franklin Roosevelt before
he signed, with two five-cent
pens, the neutrality legislation congress
had just passed before adjourning
until January. One pen went
to Administration Spokesman Key
Pittm an of the senate; the other
went to New Y ork’s Rep. Sol Bloom,
house neutrality whip, who lost
money on the deal. He had bought
an expensive pen for the signing,
ending up by trading it for the President's
five-cent variety.
The neutrality law: (1) permits
“ cash-and-carry” sale of arms to
all nations at war: (2) forbids a rm ing
of American merchantmen,
which must

ships.
For a sim ple
piece of
legislation, it brought more repercussions
than any U. S. action since
the senate voted for war in 1917.
Isolationists went home grumbling,
satisfied it would get America involved.
Flashed overseas, the news
brought cheers in London and Paris.
Britain’s Minister of Supply Leslie
Burgin said: “ The United States will
be an arsenal of unlimited resources
at the disposal of the allies.” The
British treasury and adm iralty
worked out legislation for a billiondollar
war loan to buy U. S. arms.
Paris saw a chance to overcome
the »lump in French production.
Z oom !
Aircraft and heavy industrials set
new peaks on the security market.
Trucks rumbled onto New York’s
piers, where sheds bulged with exports
awaiting British boats to carry
them away. A French militarist arrived
in Chicago seeking 10,000
horses and mules. Tv»o French
banks opened New York headquarters.
A billion dollars in war orders
from the allies were expected within
the next few weeks. Everybody was
happy except shipping interests
which stood to lose hundreds of m illions
by abandoning European
routes, laying up vessels and discharging
seamen. United States
lines partially met the problem by
transferring eight ships to P anam a
registry under the m aritim e com mission’s
authorization.
Keeping their fingers crossed were
veteran economists who saw nothing
healthy in a war boom. The
federal reserve board reported industry
rolling at the fastest pace
since 1929, while the bureau of agricultural
economics predicted an increase
in industrial and business activity.
Overseas
An orphan in the storm was the
t . .s. .S. City of Hint, released by
Norway to her American crew after
a German prize crew had docked
her at Haugesund. Neutrality left
her stranded, with no business being
abroad. Hoping to sell her cargo in
Norway and scoot for home minus
contraband, the Flint awaited opportunity.
But for angry Germany, the
Flint and U. S. neutrality were open
wounds. Sample comment: “ American
arm s have been made available
to our enemies but these m a terials
will have to get past our raiders.”
It wns also hinted that contraband
would be treated more
sternly. For example, had the Hint
been sunk outright her cargo would
now have no chance of reaching
Britain. Still open, boasted the
Reich, was her new ‘’lifeline” to
Russia, which w’as said to extend
clear to the Pacific.
Forecast
While congress headed for a twomonth
vacation, there was every
sign that its work next Janu ary will
hinge mostly on neutrality. Coming
up is the $1,300,000,000 naval
program which Georgia’s Rep. Carl
Vinson will broach (fbr 95 combatant
ships, 2,395 planes and 36 dirigibles);
an army expansion program
which the President will probably
recommend; repairs on weak spots
j of the new neutrality law; new fed- 1
| eral taxes to clamp down on war
! profiteering; aid for shippers whose |
| boats are idled by neutrality. Already
at work is an inter-depart* .
1 mental committee to see that foreign
arms orders don’t interfere
with the U. S. defense program.
Meanwhile politicians were wondering
what would happen to domestic
legislation.

armed with R um an ian and
Yugo-Slavian pacts, Mussolini was
reported engineering another pact
with Bulgaria, which is being drawn
closer and closer to Russia. A
fourth pact was underway with
Egypt. But the most concrete step
was an exchange of flowery notes
between Italy and Greece, which
felt better when Rome withdrew

potent weapon was the reminder
that the abrogated U. S.-Jap trade

Washington will not be inclined to
discuss new terms unless Tokyo is

In Washington there were signs
that the new neutrality program (see
DOMESTIC) m ight be followed by
an effort to make congress embargo
“ any or a ll” exports to Ja pa n.

“ It is entirely fair that Ja p a n should

Too Many Gifts?
Opened for John P ublic’s inspection
this month is an official an alysis
on how he spends his money.
In a 195-page report to President
Roosevelt, the national resources
planning board discovered the nation’s
29,400,300 families and 10,058,-
000 single persons had an income of
59.3 billion dollars in 1935-36. How
it was spent:
Fifty billion went for “ current
consumption,” including food, shelter
and clothing; 2.2 billion (nearly
4 per cent) was used for gifts and
contributions; 900 million went for
taxes; 6 billion was saved.
Biggest item was food, which accounted
for 17 billion dollars, or 29
per cent of the total income. Housing
took 9Vi billion. Regarding the
2.2 billion for gifts, observers held
tongues in their cheeks, realizing
that John Public usually stretches
this item in his income tax report.

WASHINGTON.—Robert A. Taft,
U. S. senator from Ohio, should read
that old nursery rhyme that starts:
“ For want of a nail a shoe was
lost, for want of a shoe a horse
was lost,” etc., wil ding up with the
kingdom being lost because a certain
rider could not get through to j
turn the tide of battle.
In the case of Mr. Taft it may be \
proper glasses. To get the answer ;
one has only to so to his native j
town of Cincinnati and ask the first !
10 people one encounters about the
Taft brothers. The answers, or at
least eight of them, will be that
Brother Charley is a swell guy, a
genial person with a smile, who will
cross the street to say “ Hello” to
a friend, or slap an acquaintance on
the back. The same eight, or r ;e,
will report that Brother Robert is
a more self-centered person, and
seldom if ever known to slap a back.
From close friends of the senator
one learns that Brother Bob would
be very glad to be a back swapper—
not just to advance his own presidential
aspirations, but because he
feels that way. But the trouble,
they confess, is that he has very
poor sight. The reason he doesn’t
wave to people he knows across the
street is that he could not possibly
realize he knows them. He just
can’t see them.
Which seems to those of us who
have been listening to this defense
to be a sharp criticism of Mr. Taft’s
glasses. Certainly there is nothing
the m atter with them for reading.
The most casual perusal of any
speech or statement Mr. Taft makes
will show that he has put a lot of
study into it, that he m ust have
read volumes in his research on the
I subject before giving vent to any
public utterance.
Maybe the Senator Needs
j New Pair of Glasses
It savors just a little of a fiction
story in • one of the magazines a
few years back, about a beautiful
girl, with particularly beautiful eyes
and • soulful expression, who for
some reason was not popular. A
smart doctor was attracted, and
finally found out the trouble. The
eyes were soulful because they were
not looking at anything. They
couldn’t. She didn’t mean to be
high-hatting young men she had met
a few days or nights before. She
simply d id n ’t recognize them! So
I the doctor forced her to wear
glasses. They were married, and
lived happily ever after!
Well, it might be that if Senator
Taft had some amazingly good
glasses, which would m ake him as
able to recognize people as his
brother, he would get a lot further
along the steep and difficult path
that leads to the White House. Certainly
if he had been using such
glasses for the last two or three
years he would even now be a bit
further up that road.
And it’s still Aot too late. It is
generally agreed in Washington
that, of the two men concededly
ahead of him in the race for the
G. O. P. nomination last spring, one
| Thomas E. Dewey, has lost ground
tremendously, and the other. Sen.
j Arthur H. Vandenberg of Michigan,
has gambled his all on this European
war issue.
Obviously there is not as much
talk about Mr. Dewey as there was.
Whether this is due to the “ overshadowing”
operations by Attorney
General Frank Murphy, or whether
the war situation has made his youth
seem more of a handicap, it is difficult
to say. Whereas Mr. Vandenberg
has not helped himself for the
j 1940 nomination by opposing the
, arms embargo repeal, whatever
may be the situation with regard to
public sentiment in 1944.
Lagging Electric Industry
.4t Last Is Shnwi ng N eiv Life
That big electric power plant to
be built at Philadelphia, and the
big play the utilities are trying to
get for it, involve some very interesting
angles. In a statement issued
by the utility executives in Wash-
| ington, stress is laid on the details—
that it will have an ultim ate capacity
of half a million kilowatts—
that it will cost $48,000,000—that it
I comes on the heels of new generat-
' ing capacity at P hiladelphia in 1938
which cost $7,000,000. Also that the
new plant will take care of 2,000.000
homes of average usage. And that
it w-ould run 7,000.000 radio receiving
sets or light 5,000,000 100-watt
lam p bulbs,
i Impressive?
Well, it's all true, but a more interesting
statement would also be
true but is not included. Which is
that this plant would have been
built ia the normal course of events:
that sim ilar proportionate additions
to plant would be added to most of
the privately owned electric systems
in the United States, and that j
actually the electric industry has
been lagging behind in additions and
betterments.
The Philadelphia story is the d irect
result of a finding by the recently
sabotaged war resources
board that the weak spot of the
war preparations situation, so far
as power for war industries is concerned,
was Philadelphia. This has
not been given any publicity, but
all the utility men knew what the
resources experts thought, feared
resulting publicity, and scrambled
to meet it.
The utilities are also putting considerable
emphasis on the fact that
this big new plant is to be run by
steam! There is a reason for that,
also. The plant would have been
designed to burn coal even if no
other reason than efficiency were
being considered, because the present
expert opinion of the industry
is that power can be produced more
cheaply from coal than from water
power.
Public Sold on Falling
W ater as a Natural Force
But the utilities realize the public
is not convinced of that. The average
citizen has been thoroughly
sold on the notion that falling water
is a natural force, the utilization
of which certainly must cost
less than to dig coal from deep
down in the earth, then haul it to a
plant, and then burn it to produce
steam. It doesn’t seem natural that
current could*be produced more economically
that way than by just
putting a turbine under falling water.
But when all the costs of a
hydro plant are added in (the Norris
dam in the TVA system alone
cost $30,000,000), the accounting
sharks say coal is the cheaper method.
But this comes at a peculiarly apt
time for propaganda purposes. The
famous Loup and Platte river projects
in George Norris’ state of Nebraska
are m aking a sorry showing,
made worse at present by the fact
that there has been such a drouth
that they are obliged to buy steamproduced
power.
Power Shortage Hampers
Japan s War Activities
The Tennessee Valley authority is
not the only hydroelectric power development
in the world which is
having trouble. There has been a
bad drouth in Ja p a n , according to
reports to the department of commerce.
Ja p a n never has had an adequate
coal supply and, like Italy, has been
spending millions trying to develop
enough water power to cut down
coal importations, and thus protect
its foreign buying power, or rather
permit the use of its foreign buying
power for more vital things—for instance
scrap iron.
The present drouth is said to be
the worst in Ja p a n 's history, but
whether this is an exaggeration or
not, it is certainly the worst drouth
since Nippon’s hydroelectric developments
reached their present m ag nitude.
Not only has the power supply to
non-urgent industries been drastically
reduced, but the country’s heavy
industries and even its munitions
plants have had to curtail production
schedules. The power shortage
has become so acute that steelm
ill operations in the important
Osaka-Kobe district were suspended
temporarily during the early part of
September due to the sudden cessation
of current.
The Ja pa n Electric Power Generation
and Transmission company,
which was recently organized to
control the Japanese electric power
industry, has already received warnings
from the m ilitary authorities
of the grave situation prevailing in
the heavy industries as a result of
the power shortage.
According to the Japanese press,
a feeling is developing in industrial
circles that bureaucratic management
is to blame for the present
predicament, but this view does not
appear to be warranted.
Couple of Stories Drapped
In by Way of Illustration
Ju s t what the bureaucrats are
supposed to have failed to do is
not made clear, in the absence so
far of any satisfactory rain-making
machinery. It reminds some observers
of the time Will Rogers was
defending the then prince of Wales,
now the duke of Windsor.
“ I keep hearing that the prince
of Wales just can’t stay on a horse,”
Will wise-cracked when annoyed at
criticisms of the prince. “ I ’ve been
looking at pictures of his falling off.
and I notice that every time the
horse is down too. I wish some of
these fellows would explain to me
how a rider is going to stay up
when his horse is down.”
But instead of wanting to shoot
the weather man, the Japanese politicians
feel that somebody ought to
resign. That seems to be a norm
al Japanese proceeding. Washington
chuckled years ago over a
story told by the late Richard V.
Oulahan of the New York Times.
W'hen riding on a train carrying
members of the royal fam ily en
route to Tokyo. Dick pulled a cord
by mistake and the train came to
a grinding stop. There was a long
delay, after which the train crawled
to the nex* station. Then the m ilitary
took charge. A day later an
old friend in the foreign office told
Dick the cabinet would have to resign
because of this incident.
“ But why?” Oulahan asked.
“ Well, it never happened before,
so we have to resign,” replied the
official.
Dick was afraid to reveal that he
was the cause of this cabinet upset,
but got out of the country as
fast as he could. Checking on his
return to Washington, however, he
found the cabinet had really quit.

T H E selling end of any business
consists of a number of
basic operations that are repeated
over and over again.
Customers are attracted and
held when such routine operations
are occasionally done in a
different way by an added
touch of showmanship.
A fruit packer in Kentucky
sent his food broker in Buffalo
a crate of carrier pigeons. As
each order was secured by the
broker it was enclosed in a metal
band fastened to a pigeon’s leg and
the bird released from the customer’s
office. Just a different way
of placing a routine order but it
made both the fruit packer and the
food broker better known among
. customers a n d
r lf l ^ prospective cus-
§■ \ tomers.
For years dogs
displayed in the
windows of pet
shops have attracted
m o r e
passersby than
any other type of
window display.
But until recently
not a single m anufacturer
of dog food has made use
of this natural interest in live dogs
to sell his product. A recently constructed
billboard in Chicago combines
an air conditioned kennel containing
live dogs with an advertisement
of a canned dog food. The
crowds that are continually in front
of it leave no doubt as to the commercial
value of this combination of
advertising and showmanship.
The acknowledgmeni of orders
received by a m anufacturing organization
might seem to be a routine
m atter with little possibility of being
made more interesting. Instead
of the usual cold, formal method of
acknowledging orders, one company
attaches a sheet notifying the customer
that the order is of direct
benefit to 800 people on the com pany’s
payroll and that the raw m a terials
used in making the goods
are bought from 412 different firms
employing 50,000 people.

Rotten Apples
\\7ERE you ever a youngster
* * back East, where they
bought apples by the barrel and
stored them in the cellar over
against the long winter evenings?
When winter came, did you
spend most of your Saturdays
sorting over the barrels of apples,
picking out the rotten ones so
they would not make the whole
barrel that way?
And d id n ’t you and the fam ily
eat nothing but rotten apples the
next week?
Isn't life like that?
And d id n’t you live in the kitchen,
because the parlor should not
be mussed up? And isn’t it the
truth that you lived in the kitchen
all your life?
And d id n’t you always wear
your old clothes, because you had
to keep the good ones to go to
meeting on Sunday? And as a result,
weren’t you run down at the
heel and patched on the seat most
of the time?
And did you ever get over it?
H aven’t you gone through life
with an inferiority complex, holding
musty ideas and most of the
time the same old worn-out notions
until they were ready for the
grab-bag? Do you still wait for
somebody else to step ahead and
do the pioneering?
You do—if you’re still eating
rotten apples —W. L. Y. Davis, in

EXPLANATIONS
WON'T SELL
A SALESMAN should know
every detail about the
product he is selling so as to be
prepared to artswer all questions.
But if this knowledge
leads h im to think that merely
explaining a product will sell it
he should be prepared for serious
disappointments. Successful
salesmen never forget that hum
an beings are reservoirs of

Bag Was Positively
Golfer s Last Chance
The fat m an decided to try golf.
Armed with six golf clubs, a ball,
and a caddie, he marched off to
the links.
The caddie placed the ball on
the tee. Then, with a terrific
swing, the fat m an whirled his
club through the air. But the little
white ball remained on its tee,
while the club, meeting mother
earth, broke into splinters.
The second, third, fourth, and

the fate of the first.

Moses Lafayette O ’Leary sat on a
box in front of Norwood’s tent, less
sober than he looked, and looking
not so sober as he should be. Facing
h im sat Sergeant Stoddart, weary
from a d a y ’s work surveying the
river.
Norwood dismounted near the
horse-line, issued sharply detailed
orders about the care of his horse
and strode toward the tent:
“ I will send for you when I want
you, Stoddart. Come here, O ’Leary.”
Norwood’s servant removed his
riding boots and produced whiskey
and soda. Norwood drank. O ’Leary
watched him drink. Norwood lighted
a cigarette, smoked half of it,
and then spoke to O ’Leary:
“ Now then. Sit down on that box
and begin. O m it the introduction.
Tell the news.’*
“ ’T’s bad, not good, news,” said
O ’Leary. “ Might have got some
good news if I ’d had more money.
Good news comes expensive oftener
than not. What I ’m tellin’ you now,
I ’d tell to Father Manoel, on bended
knees, and none but him and Saint
Antonio to hear me. So get it first
tim e. If I have to say it twice over,
I m igh t get muddled. I ’m drunk, on
account of having had to drink cheap
liquor. Seeing it was your responsibility,
and none o’ mine, me being
under your orders, I went gambling.
Cock-fights. I lost a little money to
a m an who don’t know cock-fighting
from puss-in-the-corner. But he’s
runner for the layers of odds who’d
bet you you don’t know your own
name. And they’d make money doing
it. But there weren’t much
news there.
“ Never mind the details of your
bet. Tell your story.”
“ I betted five rupees. The insiders
are offering five to one that the
M a h a raja h won’t live the week out.
I betted he w ill.”
“ Why?”
“ If me and you weren’t on the
job, I ’d hedge. It was a woman
told me why the odds are five to
one he’ll die within a week. She
was as drunk as a Bombay crow,
and she told me who’s taking the
five to one, same as I did, only for
a different reason. I asked her,
and she laughed like a hyena—”
“ Never mind what she did. What
did she tell you?”
“ She didn't tell me nothin’. She
asked questions. If the M aharajah
should die, who would come to the
throne? Who owes a lakh of rupees
and has promised to pay when he
comes to the throne? Whose creditors
have threatened to appeal to
the British Resident? Whose aunt,
being angry with h im , this very day
refused him money with which to
pay off his creditors?”
“ That sounds like palace gossip,”
said Norwood.
“ I could tell you more than that,
th a t’s happened in the palace,” said
O ’Leary. “ They’re betting even
money that the M aharajah will be
dead by midnight tonight.”
Norwood threw his cigarette
sway.
“ Go on with your story.”
“ I t ’s a string o’ questions, not a
story. When they tell you a thing
in plain words, ’tain’t true—ever.
H ere’s a question: if the heir to a
throne should owe you money, and
you’d get paid if he comes to the
throne along o’ someone dying; and
the odds was five to one that the
someone would die within a week;
wouldn’t you bet heavy against
his dying, so that if he did n 't die,
you’d get some money anyhow?
That's what R u n d h ia’s creditors are
doing. If the M aharajah dies, and
Ru nd h ia comes to the throne, they’ll
get paid. And if the M aharajah
doesn’t die, they’ll win their bet.
You get th a t? ”
“ What else did you hear?”
O ’Leary stepped outside the tent.
“ You ain't goin’ to like this o ne!”
“ Come back, you fool. Sit down.
Now, tell it.”
“ N am ing no names. Everybody
says Rundhia stopped a wallop on
the snout from her that kept the
doctor busy for a half hour. That's
all. 1 d id n ’t hear nothing else whatever.
Not enough money. I spent
what I had like a paymaster-general.
What's that you have in your
h a n d ? ”
“ Get me a dog and we’ll find out.
I t ’s some of Mrs. H arding’s fc*pd.”
“ There ain ’t no dog in camp, barring
that cur of Stoddart’s. Stoddart
keeps h im tied up, on account o’
his having bit the cook. Stoddart
don’t favor the cook, he ain't that
stupid. But if the cook gets hydrophobia,
we’ll all be biting one another
and—”
“ Bring the brute here.”
“ You mean the cook or Stoddart?”
“ The dog.”
Norwood sat smoking and frowning
until O'Leary came towing the
dog, at the end of a length of insulated
wire. It was a mean-looking
brute with pale blue eyes, a vagabond
slink in its gait, and an insatiable
void in its belly. The sight of
any kind of food excited the anim
al. He pricked his ears. Norwood
tossed him the piece of toast.
Hs gulped it.
"Hold him,” said Norwood
I The dog sat there seeming to expect
Norwood to go on feeding him .
Neither Norwood nor O ’Leary spoke
until the dog’s attention wandered
and he began to strain at the leash.
“ That will do. Let him go.”
The dog took six strides. Then he
stopped, and the toast came forth
like Jonah from the belly of the
whale.
“ Meaning?” asked O ’Leary.
“ Somebody wasn’t intended to
die,” said Norwood. “ Merely intended
to feel too ill to interfere
with someone. Can you sober up?
Or shall I—”
“ I ’m sober. Forget your medicine
chest! Once was enough o’ that
stuff! What do you want done? I ’ll
do i t ! ”
“ Do you know R u nd h ia’s Bengali
doctor?”
“ Sure.”
“ W hat’s he doing?”
“ So I needn’t be too p articular?”
“ You will be on your absolutely
best behavior.” •
“ What you want is a m iracle.”
“ Yes. And to produce one, if you
must, you may adm it that it was I
who sent you to make enquiries. Get
busy.”
C H A PT ER X II
Prince Rundhia returned from his
interview with the Resident charged
with that mysterious sensation that
can lead a genius to startling victory.
He had tasted success. He had
made a British Resident squirm.
Rundhia had crossed his Rubicon.
He had started something. He felt
like a genius, and he looked the part
“ Did you mention my name in
connection with this?”
now as he stepped out of his Rolls-
Royce at the palace front door.
The Maharanee came fussing into
Lynn’s bedroom:
“ Lynn darling, Rundhia wishes to
see you. And I have told him I won’t
speak to him until you forgive h im .”
Lynn laughed: “ All right. Come
and hear me forgive him. It seems
to me you’re more afraid of R u ndhia
than I am . Read this first:
it’s a note from Aunty. Isn’t it perfect?
Aunty is one of those people
who never use more than ten
words in a telegram.”
The Maharanee read the note
aloud:
“ Refuse the Maharanee’s invitation,
pack your things and come
away. Deborah H arding.”
“ You will obey h e r?”
“ No,” Lynn answered. “ I have
obeyed her for the last time. May
I say I have accepted your invitatio
n?”
“ Please, Lynn. Please accept it.”
“ Very well, let’s keep Rundhia
waiting, while I write her a note.”
So Lynn wrote a note to her aunt,
but she did not show it to the M aharanee.
Lynn and the Maharanee emerged
through the big brass gate and became
modern women. The seventyyear-
old servant with the key preceded
them and announced them,
but they walked into R und h ia’s den
as if it were a New York apartment,
which it rather resembled.
“ Rundhia, that you should have
dared to ask permission to speak to
Miss Lynn Harding, makes me hope
you are ashamed and that you wish
very humbly to beg her pardon.”
Rundhia was perfect. He didn’t
even make any contrite gestures.
He looked straight at Lynn as if he
and she hadn’t even an excuse for a
misunderstanding.
“ I am not in the least ashamed,”
he answered. “ A m an who wouldn’t
have behaved as I did would have
been an incongruous monstrosity
without blood in his veins, or a
heart, or a human emotion. My
humility, such as it is, is solely due
to my failure to make Lynn love
me as I love her. I live in hope.
I won’t do anything like that again.
Lynn, I admire your independent
spirit just as much as I adore your
charm. I propose to m arry you,
and I don't in the least regret having
learned that you respect yourself.”
"Good for you,” Lynn answered.
“Now Maharanee dear, you can talk
to him again, can’t you?”
“ Yes,” said the Maharanee, “ if
you are so magnanimous as to accept
that speech for an apology.
But I will not pay R und h ia’s debts
until I see how he behaves! I have
heard plenty of Ru nd h ia’s promises.”
Rundhia smiled at his aunt: “ You
dear old despot, you could make me
promise anything!” he glanced at
Lynn. “ Have you heard from Norwood?”
‘‘W'hat about h im ? ” she answered.
R und h ia’s eyes watched hers with
masked triumph.
“ There is more than a rum or,”
he said “ There is proof. To the
hilt. Norwood has accepted a bribe.
Norwood’s number is up.”
The Maharanee gasped. She
looked shocked, and Lynn noticed
it. Lynn said nothing.
“ Rundhia, what have you been doin
g ?” asked the Maharanee.
“ The Resident phoned, asking me
to come and see h im ,” Rundhia answered.
“ He has hesrd about Norwood
carrying diamonds in his pocket.”
Lynn laid down her cigarette. It
didn’t taste good. “ R u ndhia,” she
said, “ who told the Resident?”
Rundhia shrugged his shoulders.
“ How should I know?”
“ But I think you do know,” said
the Maharanee. “ R u ndhia,’’ she repeated,
“ what have you been doing
?”
“ Norwood accepted a present of
diamonds, from some agents of the
temple authorities, to write a report
in the priests’ favor, in connection
with the dispute about the boundary
line and the question of who owns
the land that the diamonds came
from. There’s your incorruptible
British officer! Same old story!
Good-by Norwood! They will hold a
court m a rtia l behind closed doors,
of course.
Lynn was remembering. The
physical struggle with Rundhia in
the treasure room was a fact
through which slowly emerged
something less than a fact—an im pression.
She remembered R u ndhia’s
eyes when she told him about
the packet of diamonds that she had
seen fall from Norwood’s pocket.
She remembered her immediate regret
at having mentioned Norwood
and the diamonds, even though she
did it to distract Ru nd h ia’s attention
from herself. Regret enlarged
itself now into a kind of cold, ap palling
horror.
“ R u nd h ia ,” she asked almost
hoarsely, “ did you mention my
name in connection with this?”
“ Why should I ? ”
“ Did you? W’ould you rather I
should ask the Resident?”
“ I had to tell him all I knew,”
Rundhia answered. “ It was confidential—
off the record. I forbade
him to mention your name or m ine .”
“ Have they arrested Captain Norwood?”
“ Norwood is a crook, who has
been found out. W’hy should you
bother about h im ? ”
The Maharanee interrupted:
“ Lynn dear, why are you so nervous?
If Rundhia learned of something
wrong, it was his duty—”
Rundhia interrupted his aunt:
“ Duty? Norwood insulted every single
one of us, including you, Lynn.
I heard him. He’s a cad. Let him
take the consequences.”
Lynn returned to the m ain point:
“ Rundhia, you say that the Resident
phoned you. But how did the
Resident know? Wasn’t it you who
phoned the Resident? If you don’t
tell me, I intend to ask the Resident.
There’s a phone here. Shall I
use it? ”
“ My advice to you is to keep out
of it,” Rundhia answered. “ They
might make you give evidence. Do
you wish to be dragged into a scandal?
Norwood is guilty. Do you
want to add to the poor devil's hum
iliation by appearing in court
against h im ? ”
“ Rundhia, was it you who told
the Resident about those diamonds
in Captain Norwood's pocket?”
Rundhia didn’t answer. Lynn got
out of her chair and went and sat
beside the phone. It was on a little
table near the Maharanee. She
raised the phone off the bracket, but
let it click down again when Rundhia
opened his lips.
“ Since you insist,’’ said Rundhia.
“ Yes. I told the Resident. However,
he was already suspicious of
Norwood. He was glad to get my
information.”
“ And you told the Resident that
your information came from m e ?”
“ I had to. But as I have al*
ready told you, I forbade him to
mention your nam e.’’
“Then I am in the position of
having betrayed Captain Norwood?”
“ Do you call it betrayal? He’s a
crook. He accepted a bribe. Not
the first time either, I dare bet
you.”
Lynn spoke indignantly: “ I don’t
believe Captain Norwood would accept
a bribe from anyone. I haven’t
even the slightest suspicion of his
being guilty, no matter what you, or
the Resident, or anyone may think.
I shouldn’t have mentioned those
diamonds to you. I did it inadvertently,
when I felt I had to say
something and it was the first thing
that came to mind. You had no
right to repeat what I said.”
“ You should first have consulted
His H ig h n e ss 'm y husband,” said
the Maharanee. “ Why didn’t you?”
“ Because he would have done
nothing, as usual,” Rundhia retorted.
L
ynn’s fingers returned to the telephone,
but her eyes were on R u ndhia.
The threat of the telephone
no longer worked. He nodded.
“Go ahead,” he said. “ Phone the
Resident, if you care to. 1 wanted to
keep you out of it, but do as you
please.”
Lynn stood up. “ No,” she answered.
“ I will write to Captain
Norwood. I will ask him to come
and see me. Perhaps my evidence
would help him. At the very least,
I can tell him how sorry I am .”
"L y nn d e a r!” said the Maharanee.
But Lynn was resolute. She
wouldn’t listen to her. “ May I have
pen, ink and paper?”
No one answered. Lynn tugged
open the drawer of the writing table,
pulled out paper, sat there and
began to write. She laid the note
she had addressed to Aunty H arding
on the desk. In her haste, she
splashed ink on the envelope. W’hen
she had finished her letter to Norwood,
she noticed the blots on the
letter to Aunty Harding. She threw
Aunty’s envelope into the waste-bas
ket. She turned both letters face
downward on the blotter while she
searched for enyelopes. There were
none ln the desk drawer. She asked
Rundhia for envelopes. He found
two. She inserted the letters, sealed
up the envelopes and addressed
them. Rundhia walked out of the
room.
“ I have sent h im ,” said the Maharanee,
“ to find a reliable messenger,
who will know how to find
Captain Norwood if he is not at his
cam p.”
Lynn gave both letters to the Maharanee.
“ D arling,” said the Maharanee,
“ Rundhia adores you so much that
you could persuade him to do anything.
”

Tiny Least Weasel Rated With Other Ferocious Animals
Ounce for ounce, with the possible
exception of the shrews, the
tiny least weasel is the most ferocious
and bloodthirsty anim al of the
m am m a lia n class. Only a fraction
over six inches ;n length, and weighing
on an average about one-third of
a pound, it is distinguished from the
other weasels by its extremely
small size and almost total
lack of the characteristic black tip
to the tail. With its long flattened
head, wide jaws, and peculiar looping
gait when scenting a trail, it
gives a definite impression of resemblance
to a reptile. There is a
tense readiness about it, com parable
to a coiled spring held precariously
in leash.
The least weasel is reddish-brown
above, and white beneath. In common
with other .weasels, it possesses
the ability to change to a
white coat in winter, which must
give it an enormous advantage over
the mice and birds upon which it
preys. In fact, it is only in the
light of the almost unbelievable
fertility of its victims that one can
conceive of their continued existence,
for all weasels are known to
attack out of mere lust for killing.
However, this is apparently
part of Nature’s scheme of checks
and balances, and ths conduct
of weasels should not be judged by
human moral standards. On the
credit side are an enormous number
of insects and rodent pests destroyed
by this small predator, thus
making it decidedly beneficial to
m a n ’s interestc.
The four North American subspecies
of this highly successful little
carnivore range from Alaska to
Hudson bay, and southward to Montana,
Minnesota, Indiana, and Pennsylvania;
but in addition, the species
has recently been shown to be
represented by Old World races,
making it circumpolar in range.
Nevertheless, despite this wide radiation,
it is rarely taken in traps and
little is known of its habits. The
nest, usually grass-lined, is in a
hole in a bank. Four to six young
are born in a litter.

he takes his post as professor of poetry

what were once considered the wild
vagaries of his compositions.
In Russia, his parents wanted

KorsakofT was the Pied Piper
who lured him from law books
to outlaw musie, but who unleashed
his genius and himself
profited as Stravinsky became
one of his most knowing and

The ira il person of Professor Stravinsky,
as he may now be called,
has been shaken and racked by the
torrent of his genius, and every so
often he has found it necessary to
take time out in Switzerland for repairs.
But, at 54, he still has furious
vitality and is still at mid-way in
his creative career.
With a sharp pencil he spears
superaural sounds. Marshaling
them in a symphony, he looses
demons, to slay them with his
baton. This demoniac dissonance
caused riots in France
when his compositions were first
produced. It took quite a few
years for discerning critics to
discover that he “ planned it that
way,” and that there was law
and order in his music.

Steel corporation, offers something
possibly worthy weighing in this balance
in his vehement repudiation of
any desire for war profits.
“ We don’t want any war to
Inflate Bethlehem's business,”
says Mr. Grace. “ We prefer
peace. We are in a position to
be war baby number one, as in
the last war, hut I can tell you
that our directors and associates
don't want that kind of business.
I'd like to see the war stop today.
Bethlehem would be better
off if it did.”
In contrast are the words of another
great industrialist, now dead,
who, at a New York luncheon club
in January, 1917, spoke as follows:
“ America has come of age. Its
ships cannot be driven from the
seas; its citizens will go wherever
their trade or business leads them.
No insolent challenge to our enterprise
will stay us in our peaceful
pursuits whenever and wherever we
choose to go. And I say to you that
our great business establishment
will remain world business for whatever
profit may legitimately accrue.
It is not only our right, but patriotic
duty to seize opportunity to m aintain
the full solvency of this nation.”
Mr. Grace, as president of
both Beth’ehem Steel and the
Bethlehem Shipbuilding corporation,
had special charge of all
production of cannon, armor
plate and munitions during the
World war. Last summer, he
rounded out 40 years with Bethlehem,
one of the great steelmasters
of the country. After
his graduation in electrical engineering
at Lehigh university,
his first job at the company
was operating an electric crine .
He became general superintendent,

Centenarians in Jugoslavia are
convinced that Methuselah must
have lived on cheese, for they already
have a good start on the record
set by the Biblical ancient. A
recent census showed that over 2,000
Jugoslavs have passed the 100-year
mark, and since the staple food of
these people is sour m ilk and goat
cheese, there seems to be some
basis for their contention.

His currently reported achievement
in mapping the peaks of the Elias
mountain range in the Yukon terri- j
tory caps a list of hazardous assign- i
ments of the last six years, in most
of which Mrs. Wood has shared.
Last March, he led several
companions up a 19,000-foot peak
in the Alpine jungles of the Sierra
Nevada de Santa Msrta
range in Colombia.
With the Louis Boyd expedition to
east Greenland in 1933, Mr. Wood
has traversed many countries, in the
last six years, on research missions
for the American Geographical society.

gift packages, will be distributed
widely this Christmas, the state department
of agriculture announced.
The package is decorated with three
rural Wisconsin scenes enclosed
within the outline of the state. Wisconsin
brewers, the department said,
plan to purchase 100,000 pounds of
cheese as gifts.
Power Plant Value $36,000 - The
public service commission decided
that the city of Adams should pay
the Wisconsin Power  Light Co.'
$36,000 to take over the Adams power
plant. The commission fixed a
price of $30,000 in 1935, but when
the acquisition proceedings reached
the supreme court recently the case
was remanded to the commission for
a new valuation.
To Enforce Curfew Law -De Forest,
in Dane county, a village of 500,
has decided to enforce its curfew
ordinance. A ll persons under 16 are
subject to a $10 fine if they are u n accompanied
by an older person on
the street or in a public place after
8 p. m. between Oct. 1 and May 1, or
after 9 p. m. from May 1 to Oct. 1.
The ordinance, enacted in 1903, has
not been enforced for a number of
years.
Many Twins Born Last Year —
Four sets of triplets and 546 sets of
twins were born in Wisconsin in
1938. O f the triplets, two sets consisted
of one boy and two girls, one
of two girls and one boy, and one
of three girls. Mothers between the
ages of 20 and 24 gave birth to 17,-
099 babies last year, to lead other
age groups. Mothers between the
ages of 24 and 29 ranked second, giving
birth to 15,773 infants.
Relief Cases Increase -A 12 4 per
cent increase in general relief cases
in ^Wisconsin from August to September
was reported by the state
welfare department, which attributed
the ris? in part to curtailment of
the WPA employment program.
General relief was extended in September
to 50,717 cases, representing
172,000 persons or 5.6 por cent of the
total state population. In August the
case load was 45,124.
Simplify Auto License Plan -New

mailed to automobile owners
in November, was announced by
George W. Rickeman, head of the
newly created motor vehicle department.
To obtain 1940 automobile licenses,
owners must send the certificate
of title to the motor vehicle
department, Madison, accompanied
by check, money order or bank draft
for thc correct f»*e payable to this
department. Rickeman w a r n e d
against making the payments to any
other department. Before creation
of the new motor vehicle department
this year, the secretary of state was
in charge of automobile licensing.

2. The Churches:
In place of the annual church bazaar,
the Vicar of St. John’s, Waterloo,
England, billed expected patrons as
follows, inviting them to let their conscience
guide them in filling in
amounts: “Bus fare to hall . . . .
entrance fee . . . . w**ar and tear on
clothes . . . . wear and tear on tempers
. . afternoon tea . . side shows . . useless

Thanksgiving D a y ? ? ?
That one week reprieve ordered by
Governor Heil for Wisconsin turkeys!
in order that “tradition mierht be

appears that W’isconsin will compromise,
some eating their turkey on Nov.
23, President Roosevelt’s proclaimed
day, others on Nov. 30, Governor Heil’s
day, and then there will be a few who
will have both days in which to give
thanks.
An attorney general’s ruling following
the difference of opinion on “aiding
Christmas business” and “respecting
tradition” stated that both were legal
holidays for state employes. Governor
Heil has followed this with a letter
to the board of personnel stating
that state employes will be authorized
but one day for Thanksgiving and
that on the day he has proclaimed,
November 30.
However, the secretary of state’s
office and the attorney general’s
office have stated that they would observe
both days in accordance with the
legal department’s ruling. Other departments
claim that they will abide
by the Governor’s order. In Madison
and Milwaukee and in other cities
throughout the state, November 23
thanksgiving days have been proclaimed
by city mayors.

Truck License War
R h e u m a t i c
P a i n s C r u e l
All was quiet on the western front
this week as Wisconsin and Minnesota
enjoyed a ten day armistice in their
truck war which formally began Nov.
7. Meanwhile high officials from both
states were to have met Tuesday to
arbitrate their differences.
It all began when George Rickeman,
commissioner of Wisconsin’s motor
vehicle department, instructed state
“border patrols” that Minnesota
trucks not bearing Wisconsin licenses
were subject to arrest when they entered
the state. He took this action,
he explained, because he believed Wisconsin’s
reciprocity pact with Minnesota,
which provided that truckers
from each state should be allowed to
make trips into the other state without
having to buy thi state’s license,
has been violated. Rickeman charged
that Minnesota authorities had been
arresting Wisconsin truckers and informing
them that they would have to
buy Minnesota licenses despite this
agreement.
“ Bulletins” from the front after the
outbreak of hostilities were conflicting.
Wrisconsin officials denied a report
that three arrests had been made,
though they admitted warnings to get
Wisconsin licenses had been issued.
Minnesota authorities, meanwhile,
denied violating the reciprocity pact.
They said certain commercial truckers
not covered by the pact may have been
arrested. There was some indication
that the two states may have had j
different conceptions of what the pact
covered.
Meanwhile L. E. Muth, La Crosse,
manager o f the Winona-La Crosse
joint traffic bureau, contacted the^
Minnesota secretary of state’s office;
and the Wisconsin motor vehicle department.
A 10-day truce was a rranged,
during which the two states
will try to settle their differences.
Stanley and Victor were Stevens Point
visitors last Thursday.
Felix Rekowski was a business caller
at Waupaca Thursday.
Mr. and Mrs. Russel Smith visited
wtih Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Erbrecht and
fam ily at Shawano on Sunday.
Mr. and Mrs. Felix Rekowski were
Tigerton callers Thursday.
Antone Stroik and Miss Emily Plaski
were united in marriage at Stevens
Point Tuesday. Those attending from

November 22 finds John Nance ( “Cactus Jack**) Garner , most un-
Throttlebottomish vice president in L. S. history, celebrating his 70th
birthday. The event is significant, because it calls attention to the age

ADVENTURERS’ CLUB
HEADLI NES FROM THE LIVES
OF PEOPLE LIKE YOURS ELF ! ______________
“ Death Trap at El Chivo”
He l l o e v e r y b o d y :
“ You asked for a real life adventure," says Morris E .
Lowder of Chicago, “ so here goes.”
That’s the way I like to hear you boys and girls talk. I ask
for it, and you dish it up. And just between you and me, the
boys and girls in Chicago and its neighboring towns—and for
that matter, all over northern Illinois—are dishing them up
faster than any bunch of folks I ’ve struck yet.
The Adventurers’ club has installed chapters in a number of
cities. I ’ve been swamped with m ail in every doggone one of
| them. But never have I been swamped the way Chicago has
swamped me. I ’m mighty grateful to you for your hearty response.
I ’ve had a flock of good yarns from you, but it’s going to
take a little time.
And speaking of being swamped — well — Morrie Lowder
knows something about that, too. As if we didn’t have
enough floods right here in this country—what with floods of
letters and flooding rivers—Morrie had to go to Cuba and get himself
into a first-class flood down there. Morrie was assistant m anager for
on American drug concern and in the latter part of May, 1924, he started
out from Havana on a business trip into the Oriente province.
Trains Filled With Inauguration Throngs.
It was the day after the inauguration of Gerardo Machado as president
and the trains were filled to overflowing with people who had come
j to view the proceedings. The train Morrie was on was one of 18 cars,
every one of them packed with people
It had been raining for three days before his inauguration,
and it was still raining. The streets were full of water when
Morrie left Havana—but he was to see a lot more water before
bis journey was over.
By the time they reached the town of Colon in Matanzas province,
the water in the streets was a foot deep. Beds and chairs were floating

C o oking the Thanksgiving
D inner
Back home in Lvalde, Tex., he loves to hunt and fish with a few
old cronies. who probably know the real John Garner better than any
of his Washington colleagues. Here he's fishing with Ross Brumfield ,
who operates a garage when the vice president isn't around.
The passengers were helpless on a bridge that might be washed
away at any minute.
about and people were m aking for the upper ^floors of the few tall buildings
in town. Morrie thought the train would stop there and make no
attem pt to go on until the water had gone down, but to his surprise it
j moved on toward Macagua.
Morrie knew that the country up ahead was low and flat. What was
more, they had to cross a river called El Chivo—a stream that became
a howling torrent when it was swollen by the rains.
The train puffed along, part of the time through water that
came to the hubs of its wheels. At last it came to the trestle
spanning the El Chivo.
It was about seven o'clock, and pitch dark, when they started
across that viaduct.
“ Sharp flashes of lightning,” says Morrie, “ were the only things we
I could see by. The two engines up ahead were puffing and roaring, and
I we could feel the trestle shiver under the weight of the train and the
| pressure of some 12 feet of water that went tearing under it, carrying
trees and animals to destruction. All of a sudden the train came to a
! stop with a terrible jolt.
Morrie Offers Help to Injured.
As a medical m an, .Morrie stepped forward and offered to
help if any one was injured. Several of them—Morrie among
them—went forward to the express to see what had happened.
They found out, all right. The viaduct, weakened by the flood,
was breaking up. Even while they stood in the express car, a
whole section of the road bed was swept from beneath it, leaving
the car hanging in mid air with only its couplings holding it up!
The train couldn’t move now. The two engines were on the other side
of the break—the cars—the passengers, helpless on a bridge that might ;
be washed away at any moment. They were sure that, by this time, j
there must be other breaks in that bridge—breaks behind them that
would leave them marooned in the middle of the swollen river.
“ We uncoupled the pin of the baggage car,” says Morrie,
“ and with a rush such as I never want to hear again, it was
swept away. IVe began sending up flares in the hope of bringing
aid, but they were answered by only a few poor guajiros, them selves
marooned on the thatched roofs of their homes. The con*
ductor in charge mustered about 10 of us for any duty, and to
be truthful about it, we all thought that this would be the last
duty any of us would perform.”
Passenger Cars Thought to Be Sinking.
Morrie had a sm all medical kit, and the doctors aboard m ade good j
use of his supplies. Suddenly came the news that the first of the pas- i
senger cars was sinking into the river. Tne men uncoupled that car,
herding its passengers into others that were already overcrowded.
Incredible as it may seem the calendar
is bringing Thanksgiving time
again and with it comes to every

menu—plans for its preparation
and anticipation of the fam ily ’s
return.
Today, however, I want to reverse
this whole situation. I want
to suggest to you
that enjoyment of
your fam ily on
Thanksgiving day
should be the keynote
of every one
of the plans that
you make for the
day. Now that
does not mean for
one minute that I
am suggesting
that the Thanksgiving dinner be
slighted. I couldn’t do that, for who
of us for one minute would sacrifice
those precious memories of
Thanksgiving dinners at grandmothers
that are really priceless heirlooms.
No, I say—we won’t sacrifice
the dinner—but we will plan it so
that you will be as free as possible
on Thanksgiving day so that you too
can enjoy the fam ily and let the
fam ily enjoy you. A miracle you
say? No—not really—just wise planning—
plenty of work the day before
perhaps—but tim e—no worry—and
an easy dinner on Thanksgiving—
and that’s worth while isn’t it?
How to do it? Well here are my
suggestions. First, it is entirely possible
to clean, prepare and even
stuff the turkey the day before
Thanksgiving rather than on
Thanksgiving morning. Then put it
on a rack in an open roasting pan
and store it in your refrigerator
over night. If you have a mechanical
refrigerator it will be running of
course. If you have an ice refrigerator,
be sure to get an ample supply
of ice so that your refrigerator
can really work for you over this
holiday.
Vegetables—salads—relishes, including
celery, radish roses, etc.,
even desserts, one
f and all can be
gotten ready on
Wednesday and
as I say, then all
-v that remains for
Thanksgiving day
is just the cookj
r % takle setting
and later the
serving of the viands.
Below I am including a number
of Thanksgiving recipes which are
all planned for just such Thanksgiving
ease. And—a happy Thanksgiving
to each one of you.
Roast Turkey.
Allow *4 to 1 pound of turkey per
person served. Dress, clean, stuff
and truss turkey. Brush well with
unsalted fat and place on rack in

“ and while we were working over them we could feel the cars jerk

But already help was on the way. One telegraph line was
still up. and. when the train didn't come through, Macagua wired
Colon to send an engine. A switching engine came down from
Colon and found that, contrary to Morrie’s belief, there were no
breaks in the western end of the trestle. The crew loaded all
the passengers into six cars, and Morrie says they put them
in three deep in the aisles.
“ We went back the next m orning,” says Morrie, “ just to see what
had happened to the engineer and the fireman we had left behind. !
The engines were sunk in the river until only the roofs showed, but there
were the engineers and firemen waving to us from the tops of the cabs.”

Sliding Drawers.—Wax or soap

dresser drawers will make them
move in and out easily.
* • *
Removing Odors.—Odors can be
removed from bottles by rinsing
with cold water to which a little
dry m ustard is added.
• • •
Stuff Fowl Loosely.—Stuffings in
fowl or fish should not be packed
too tightly because they expand
considerably while baking.
• • •
When Glass Breaks.—A handful
of moistened absorbent cotton will
pick up bits of broken glass without
endangering the fingers.
• • •
Care of Electric Cord.—Don’t
twist, bend or tie the so-called
cord attached to your electric iron.
It is not a cord, but two bundles
of wires.
• • •
House P lan t.—The phillodendron
or d evil’s try is a fast grower and
is a most satisfactory plant to
grow in vases on a mantel. It
may be grown in earth or water.
• • •
New Hot-Water Bottle.—Add a
teaspoonful of glycerine to the hot
water when filling a new rubber
hot-water bottle for the first time.
This keeps the rubber soft and in

Restoring Leather Bindings.—
E q u al parts of m ilk and white of
egg beaten together will freshen
leather bindings. R ub on gently
with old flannel. Polish with an
old silk handkerchief.
• • •
Using Celery Tops.—Celery tops
dried in the oven and then rubbed
through the fingers to a powder,
make an excellent flavoring for
soups and stews. They will keep
for months if stored in an air-tight
ja r or tin.
• • •
Topping for Pork Roast.—For a
tasty topping for that pork loin
roast: when the roast is nearly
cooked, spread generously with
applesauce mixed with brown sugar
and a little cinnamon and clove,
then brown until a slight crust is
formed.

Now for the Mirror
And Old Piano Stool
By RUTH W YET H S P E A R S
T H E illustration shows what be-
’■* came of the mirror and piano
stool which the bride had left over
last week. To the m irro r and
stool were added two wooden
boxes from the grocery. These
were placed on end about 18
inches apart and a shelf of Viinch
pine screwed to the top. A
fram e was then screwed to the
back of the boxes as shown here.
A curtain rod was placed across
the top and the m irro r hung
lengthwise under it. An arm was
then hinged to the front of each
box. P aint was next. White, because
white furniture is sm art and
because it matched the woodwork.
The flowered chintz in tones of
rose and blue-green with narrow
frills of the plain blue-green tone
matched the window curtains.
The dressing ^able skirt was
made with a one-inch heading
at the top and tacked along the
ends of the table and the hinged
arm s with thumbtacks through a
double strip of the plain m aterial.

Isn’t This Why

What do you eat for breakfast?
Coffee, toast, maybe some eggs?
What do you eat for lunch and
dinner? White bread, meat, potatoes?
It’s little wonder you’re constipated.
You probably don't eat
enough "bulk.” And "b u lk ”
doesn’t mean the amount you
eat. It ’s a kind of food that forms
a soft “bulky” mass ln the Intestines

All-Bran Is a natural food, not a
medicine — but It’s particularly
rich in “bulk." Being so, It can
help you not only to get regular
but to keep regular. You won’t
have to endure constipation, you
can avoid it. Eat All-Bran daily,
drink plenty of water, and life
will be brighter for you! Made by
