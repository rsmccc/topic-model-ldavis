The safety parade made a deep
impression The place to teach safety
is among the young people and in the
schools and there is no question but
what Jackson county is learning the
lesson May these young people some
day do their bit in helping cut the
accident ratio to the quick

A Little History of People of the
Black River Valley Indisms-Whites
By A P JONES
THE INDIANS
Indians of many different tribes
frequented the Black river valley for
thousands of years before the coming
of the whites That they were
transients rather than residents is evidenced
by the absence of village sites 
burial mounds and gardens by camping
places and the temporary work
shops where they fashioned their
crude stone weapons and implements 
The granite outcroppings along the
Black river at the falls are many
miles farther south than anywhere
else in the entire Mississippi river
valley Men o f the early stone age
came up the rivers from all o f the
country to the south and picked out
wedge shaped granite rocks from the
river bed from which they made
heavy axes and hammers From the
worn and rounded glacial rocks thickly
strewn along the same river they
selected those suitable for making
light hammers com grinders and
weapons with the least amount of labor 
Archaeologists insist that primitive
man made weapons and implements
out of stone by pounding and rubbing
for centuries before he learned the
art of chipping stone When the In dians
had acquired the art o f chipping
stone they came to the Black
river valley for material from which
they made arrow and spear heads 
knives skin scrapers and other sharp
cutting implements 
The source of that supply was the
Silver Mound To get this highly
prized material they made long pilgrimages
from the east the west the
north as well as from the south They
came from a much wider range of
country than they came from for material
for their heavy axes and hammers 
Artifacts made from that particular
and rare type of qurtzite are
found many hundred miles away evidence
that the ancient arrow makers
came from a great distance and also
indicating that these artifacts were
used as barter and were prizes as war
loot 
Further interesting and convincing
evidence of how primitive man frequented
the Black river valley is
found in the petroglyphs or the prehistoric
picture writing found cut into
the surface of the rocks No one
knows what these inscriptions mean 
no one knows who made them no one
knows when they were made 
A fter 1650 but very few if any
Indians ever came to the Black river
valley for material for stone implements
and the art of chipping stone
was soon lost to all of the Indian
tribes There were not many Indians
in the valley and no Missions or fur
trading post were ever established
here by the French 
I t does not appear that there was
war among these many different In dian
tribes for possession of the Black
river valley nor for control o f the
quartzite quarry In fact many years
ago old Winnebagoes declared that
in those long gone by days the Indians
had a common term for the rock
that chips and cuts that there was
a general belief that it was a gift
from the Great Spirit to all people
of the race that by command of
the Great Spirit Indians of every
tribe should be permitted to get what
they needed without molestation 
Some evidence of Indian warfare
have been found in the lower Black
river valley Probably of conflict
between the Sioux and the Ojibway
who were ancient enemies A battle
in the lower valley was fought after
the white man s steel had largely replaced
stone for weapons 
During the long French regime and
also through the much shorter one of
the British there was no recognition
of boundaries between the Indian nations 
The first attempt to establish
such boundaries was at Prairie du
Chien in 1824 when the United States
called together the chiefs sachems 
head men and warriors of the many
Indian nations in council 
While the treaty of that council
tentatively named the Black river and
the East Fork as a part of the boundary
of the Winnebago nation it also
specifically stated that the Menominee
nation claimed all of the land
between the Yellow and the Black
rivers that in the absence of interested
chiefs of both tribes the matter
was left open for future determination 
The final determination came
in 1837 when both the Winnebagoes
and the Menominess ceded all rights
and all claims to all lands east of the
Mississippi river to the United States 
It was the Menominee Indians who
protested the coming of white men to
the Black river valley and who burned
the Rollett saw mill in 1819 
North of the East fork the Chippewa 
possessed the Black river valley 
Between the Black and the Mississippi
it was all Sioux land The
Winnebagoes never had undisputed
possession of any portion of the
Black river valley 
The coming of the Winnebagoes to
the Black river valley was influenced
by the Winnebago uprising in 1827
under Chief Red Bird the Black
Hawk W ar of 1832 the treaties of
1828 and 1833 by which they ceded
all of their lands across the Wisconsin
river to the United States and the
forced removal of many Winnebagoes
to the reservation west o f the Mississippi
by the U S Army in 1834 
A lot o f the Winnebagoes did not
want to leave the Wisconsin country
and they did want to avoid trouble
with the whites They came to the
Black river valley as far as possible
from the scene o f strife When Decorah s
band came to the lower Black
river valley they met with a lot of
opposition from the Sioux who did
not cede that country to the United
States until 1837 The Red Bird
band settled in the Disco section
which was also Sioux country Carimony

chiefs in the early negotions be-

THE WHITES
The first mention of the Black
River valley found in the records of
white men is in the report of a Jesuit
missionary to his superior in the
church at Montreal A band o f Huron
Indians with whom the Jesuit
missionaries had labored were driven
from their homes in northern Michigan
by Indian enemies The Hurons
reached the upper valley of the Black
river and when they were reported to
be starving Father Menard of the
Chequomegon Bay Mission made an
effort to reach them On the journey
Father Menard disappeared in the
great pine forest and it is doubtful
if he ever reached any portion o f the
Black river valley 
No one ever will know the name of
the first white man who did reach the
Black river valley Records o f those
early days contain only the names of
men of the church and of the licensed
fu r trade Other white men followed
the old Indian trails and the
water routes through the new world 
Pierre Charles La Seuer was In
charge of the French fu r trading post
on Chequomegon Bay in 1695 and
was ordered to open up trade routes
to the south Undoubtedly Le Seuer
followed the Black river from its
source to the Mississippi but he was
so obscessed with the belief that he
had discovered a rich silver mine that
he made no detailed report of his explorations
and positively refused to
reveal the location of the silver mine 
After trying in vain for three years
to get permission from the authorities
of New France to Montreal to develop
the mine Le Seuer went to France
and obtained such permission direct
from the King He then purchased
a lot of European made mining tools 
engaged the services of 17 experienced
miners and brought them to the
new world Fitting out his expedition
at New Orleans he came to the
upper Mississippi country no one
knows just where More than a year
later he returned to New Orleans
without having found a trace of silver 
his miners had been killed by the
Indians his expensive equipment
abandoned 
Whether these facts had any connection
with stories in circulation in
the early days of a lost silver mine
and buried treasure in the Black river
valley probably never will be known 
A party of St Louis miners who
came up the Black river about 1850 
with maps and mining equipment insisted
that they had found excavations
on the Silver Mound that had
been made at least 50 years before 
that they had found further evidence
of explorations by white men on the
same mound they estimated as being
150 years old or made about 1700 
The first reputable geologists to
visit the northwest territory were attracted
to the Silver Mound by its
name and reputation They described
the Mound and expressed surprise
that it should have such a name and
reputation when its geologic formation
was so well known to be strictly
of a non-metal bearing nature 
In 1817 Stephen A Long of the
U S Army made a trip up the Mississippi 
passing the mouth of the
Black river and reported On this
river there is an abundance o f pine
of excellent quality 
Joseph Rolette Col John Shaw 
Wilfred Owens and Constant A ndrews
have all been given credit for
building the first saw mill in Wisconsin
on the Black river at the falls 
Andrews wrote Falls Black River 
Nov 10 1819 On the second day
of November 1 set a saw mill running
not much inferior to any in the
United States This saw mill was
burned by the Indians the same fall
and the white men were driven down
the river 
The diary o f William Keyes a
young Vermonter tells of his being
at Prairie du Chien in 1817-1819 
Keyes states that on April 16 1818 
a party of men returned from the
Black river in a starving condition 
That year Keyes was employed by
Thomas McNair and both with a crew
of men came to the Black river to cut
timber Other loggers joined them
including those of Rolette Keyes
states that all remained near the Falls
until April 14 1819 when they started
down the river with eight rafts
of logs 
C R Johnson who came to the
Black river valley in 1845 who
taught school and practiced law and
also fought in the Mexican and Civil
Wars appears to have been the first
person to have made definite written
records of the settlement of the valley
by the white men From the records
left by Captain Johnson the remainder
of this story is taken As
near ver batum as possible touching
but a few of the high spots and for
the first ten years only 
From the time that Rolette s expeditionists
were driven off the river
there was no attempt to effect a settlement
at the Falls until late in
the spring of 1839 (the Indians having
the year before ceded to the Government
all the lands on Black river
claimed by them) when an expedition
was organized at Prairie du
Chien for a permanent settlement and
the improvement of the water-power
at Black River Falls by Robert and
Andrew Wood who had in their employ 
Jacob Spaulding millwright Jo seph
and Alonzo Stickney Hiram
Yeatman Isaac Van Norstrand John
Anglemiller Robert Sawyer Joel Lemon
and 13 others 
The party under the leadership of
Wood Brothers reached La Crosse
(then a naked prairie except as the
Indians temporarily set up their wigwams
there) by steamboat by which 
in those days not more than two trips
were made during the running season 
from St Louis to forts along the
river and to Fort Snelling just
above the present site of the city of
St Paul in Minnesota

Equity Manager to Talk at County
Wide Picnic
C F Chaflin manager o f Equity
Cooperative Livestock Sales Association
on the Milwaukee Market is
scheduled to talk at the county wide
picnic to be held at Hixton park on
Sunday June 18 Mr C laflin is recognized
as an authority on cooperative
livestock marketing and will be
able to give farmers in this territory
a comprehensive picture covering the
vital problems confronting livestock
producers in the marketing of their
livestock and other products The organization
he represents has shown
steady growth each year Organized
in the year 1922 by farmers who recognized
the value of setting up an
organization that they would own and
control themselves it has grown to be
by far the largest livestock marketing
organization in Wisconsin During
the past year it handled more
than eight and one-half million dollars
worth o f livestock for more than
40 000 farmers who marketed their
livestock through more than 200 shipping
associations During the past
four years E quity has had the honor
o f handling more veal calves than
any other selling agency in the United
States and in 1938 established the
highest record selling a total o f over
190 000 calves 
Equity is organized under the cooperative
laws of the state of Wisconsin 
It makes commission charges
the same as other commission firms
operating on the Milwaukee market 
A t the end of the year the profits are
pro-rated back to the member organization 
which at the present time 
number 209 In 1938 the profit or
saving o f the organization was 27 -
891 13 This was pro-rated back to
the member organization in proportion
to the amount o f livestock that
each one ships to Equity The shipping
associations of this county received
 373 67 as their share o f the
profits 
Three livestock shipping associations
in the county namely Black
River Falls Hixton and Alma Center 
are members of Equity 
Equity has grown to such proportions 
that it has handled a larger
gross business than any other producer
or consumer cooperative operating
in the state of Wisconsin It also is
operating on the lowest net cost per
carload of livestock o f any other selling
agency operating on a terminal
market in the United States

HEMMY W R IT E S
In reply to a letter of inquiry by
the president o f the Jackson County
Cooperative Advancement Association
to our representatives in the state
legislature Mr Hemmy and Mr Paulson 
in regard to their stand on the
Anti-Cooperative bills that have been
introduced in the Legislature and
their likelihood of passing and becoming
laws Mr Hemmy writes as follows 
Dear Mr H orswill 
There is apparently much concern
in Jackson county as to what this
Legislature will do with the cooperative
laws of Wisconsin 
One reason for that fear is probably
due to the abolition o f both the
Wisconsin Development Authority
and the Wisconsin Agricultural A uthority 
which were designed to help
and encourage the development of
Rural Electrification as well as other
cooperative organizations 
Another reason for this concern is
the fact that the Wisconsin Chamber
of Commerce presented their program
of wrecking the cooperative laws in
this state 
Personally I feel that the storm is
over as fa r as wrecking these laws
goes The Progressive members o f
the Legislature are united in support
o f the cooperative movement some
o f the membership of the other political
parties feel that they have already
gone too fa r in opposing this
form o f enterprise 
Bills have been introduced to conform
with the program of the Wisconsin
Chamber of Commerce but I
feel they will be defeated and the
state of Wisconsin will continue to
have the best cooperative laws of any
state in the Union

A fter the awards were given out 
the kids went dashing around trying
to have their friends write in their
annuals before they were hurried off
to Hatfield the scene o f the picnic 
A t Hatfield before the crowd was
dispersed races were held of which
Shirley Austin Dorothy Quinn C lifford
Fullington and Kenneth Kolbrak
were the winners They each received
a quarter 
Then as part o f the lunch had already
mysteriously disappeared we
all pitched in and ate with whatever
was the most handy I saw quite a
few using a knife and even their fin gers 
Anyhow it was all done away
with and with a contented look in
their eyes the kids rushed into the
pavilion to finish up on pop before
they started skating 
Many of them had never skated
before so a good time was had by all
with only a few scraped shins a few
slivers and a couple of future black
and blue spots

YOU MUST BE USING
IS O -V IS MOTOR O L
 IT S THE WAY your oil level stays up at full that makes me think
you re using Iso-Vis That longer-lasting quality of Iso-Vis is one of the things
that has made it the most popular motor oil in the Midwest Iso-Vis is
triple-treated to make it a better longer-lasting summer lubricant Perishable 
carbon-forming portions are removed one whole quart is removed
from every four quarts of distilled oil by Standard s special refining
processes That s why Iso-Vis is such
a fine anti-carbon-forming lubricant 
N o wonder it lasts so long I f
you are not using Iso-Vis now change
to Iso-Vis the next time you need oil
 and see for yourself how it lasts!

M E RLIN H U L L S LETTER
The flunkeydom of Washington society
is much be-fluttered over the
visit of the English King and Queen 
on June 8th and 9th The State department 
which has a special division
which prompts our big-wigs as to
what to do and what not to do in
the presence of royalty is beset with
inquiries from those who desire to
be included among the sacred few
who will share the atmosphere o f royalty
when it comes In justice to the
visitors it should be said that the
King and Queen are helpless in the
matter of whom they shall meet and
what they shall do while here The
program for their visit will be largely
outlined from the State department
and the British embassy apparently
with suggestions innumerable
from our ambassadors abroad who
presumably have been transmitting
voluminous communications advising
the local social directors 
I f one could judge from their attitude
on their Canadian tour the
royal visitors might prefer much less
red tape and a far more democratic
reception a more intimate contact
with the people of the America as
is and less of fuss and formality
in meeting a select few of our social
select Any visitors repres nting
foreign governments should b jhown
proper courtesy and respect whether
from England or Paraguay Proper
precautions for their safety eomfort
and pleasure while here are a matter
o f course It is likely however that
the royal guests on their way through
Canada obtained a better glimpse of
the kind of people on this side of
the Atlantic who made the two countries
what they are than they will in
their contact with high officials and
a relatively few bespangled and bejeweled
socialities and social climbers
in the national capital The troubles
o f officialdom have not been lessened
by the social wire pulling which has
been going on here for weeks I t is
to be hoped that the visitors will
leave more impressed with the
warmth of their reception among the
h a lf million people who will line the
streets and avenues to see them than
with their walled-in reception by the
elect Kings and queens are but men
and women after all and no matter
what their position in any country 
they are measured by their humanitarian
spirit rather than by the tapeline
of social functions 
It is proposed that the capitol shall
be closed to all except senators and
congressmen and the policing force
when the royal visitors come to pay
a courtesy call on congress The visitors
are to take their places in the
large rotunda and senators and congressmen
who desire to may march
by in single file The ceremony is to
require about 30 minues With thousands
o f visitors from out o f town 
anxious to go through their own capitol
while here the reason for closing
the entire structure during the function
is not so plain to those o f us who
are uninformed as to the mysteries
o f such proceedings Probably not
many members who will be in the reception
line will respond to the edict
o f the State department prescribing
the formal dress Meeting royalty
in a reception line is one thing Having
a State department bureau chief
dictate what congressmen shall wear
is quite another 
Financial experts estimate that the
government is in the banking business
to the extent of twelve billions of
dollars I f that is correct it stands
next to the life insurance companies
in volume of operation To arrive at
such a conclusion and such figures it
would be necessary to include a lot
o f activities which under ordinary
conception are quite foreign to banking
methods and practices By including
the national debt as a banking
function of government including also
war loans made to foreign governments
on which the government as a
banker has proved to be a poor collector 
it might be as easy to estimate
the federal operations at 50 billions
instead o f 12 billions The real extent
o f its activities along banking lines
probably is less than its operations in
insurance which embrace a very wide
field 
The total o f loans made by the
ten major federal agencies including
those o f the R F C under the previous
administration has been approximately
eleven billions o f dollars 
O f that huge sum nearly six billions
have been repaid with interest leaving
credits outstanding o f over five
billions 
Interest and income received for
the seven-year period have come to
 1 365 000 000 against which have
been charged o ff for interest paid
and losses 637 379 000 leaving a
comfortable margin of 728 086 000
as gross earnings from the operations 
Expenses have amounted to 313 -
000 000 The operating profit therefore
is some 414 000 000 or about
4 on all loans made after deduction
of losses which have been plenty
large enough That there should
be even a paper profit shown after
ten years of depression is a favorable
indication o f the economic foundation
of our country 
The loans outstanding cover a wide
field quite different than those originally
made to protect banks trust
and insurance companies railways 
etc O f the five billions still out there
are nearly one billion dollars due
from states and municipalities upon
loans made for PW A projects A n
equal amount or more is represented
 in projects such as the Boulder and
Grand Coulee and many other dams 
which are expected to be self-liquidating
over a long term o f years 
Hundreds o f millions are also represented
in the bonds of land banks the
H O L C and numerous other activities 
In some o f them the government
is an insurer or guarantor 
just as i t acts in the insurance o f
bank deposits and those of building
and loan associations It might be said
that the government is as much or
more o f a bond-holder than banker 
An outstanding fact which does not
sit so well in the minds o f many is
that in years ago the government
was the banker for foreign nations
engaged in war and the loans it then
made exceed by two billions the
4-H M O V IE P ROGRAM

wishes to extend an invitation to people
in the different communities to
attend one o f the 4-H club movies
sponsored by the county 4-H Club
members

club work and to start a program

action toward building a 4-H club

Club leaders and members feel that
it is their responsibility to make every
effort to improve sleeping conditions

at the fair grounds to care for
their calves colts sheep pigs etc

solve the sleeping problem Parents
would feel more inclined to allow
their children to exhibit their projects

boys and girls were remaining at the
fair grounds under the strict supervision
of two club leaders 
Interesting films will be shown
which should be entertaining for older
folks as well as children Travel

amount it has loaned through the ten
agencies here at home There has
been no profit no gain in those wartime
transactions Really the loss of
interest alone amounts to fa r more
than all the loans made for the purposes
of our own people before and
since the depression It would require
an immense canvas on which to paint
the real picture of Uncle Sam as a
banker in the past fifty years and it
would be a less encouraging portrait
than later figures present on a smaller

THE IN D IAN S
tween their nation and the United
States settled east o f the Black river 
The Winnebagoes never had a reservation
in Wisconsin 
From 1837 u n til 1882 45 long 
heart-breaking years the Winnebagoes
had no legal right to land or
other resources in the Black river valley 
They were permitted to make
camp plan t gardens and gather fuel 
to hunt trap fish and pick wild berries
by toledar ce o f the government
and o f the white owners o f the land 
D urin g all o f those years they were
denied their just share o f the interest
on their trust fund and in expenditures
from tribal money 
I t is true that they all had an
equal per capita share in the reservation
lands and in the tribal trust
fu n d but they would not stay on the
reservation no matter where Because
o f this a ruling o f the Indian
Bureau would not permit them to receive
payments elsewhere When in
1874 the U S A rmy again forcibly
removed them to their reservation in
Nebraska they would not remain
there 
In 1882 by special Act o f Congress 
a fter they had relinquished all reservation
rights the Winnebagoes in
Wisconsin were permitted to take up
homesteads on the public domain and
were granted citizenship rights More
than h a lf o f all homesteads taken up
were in the Black river valley and
nearly all o f these were in eastern
Jackson county While the lands were
mostly worthless for agricultural purposes
they are still in possession of
the Indians the deeds containing restrictions
against alienation and taxation 
In 1915 other lands were
bought for individuals in the Black
river valley with tribal trust funds 
The granting o f homestead and citizenship
rights did not materially a ffect
the conditions under which the
Winnebagoes were living in the Black
river valley They still had to hunt 
trap fish and pick wild berries where
they could in order to live The ann
u al per capita payments o f interest
on the tribal trust fund which began
at the same time did very materially
affect the credit o f the Winnebagoes
with certain traders who at once began
to sell ponies vehicles and merchandise
to them upon their promise
to settle up a t payment time These
annual payments stopped with the
disbursement of the tribal trust fund
in 1915 
In the spring of 1879 Jacob H auser 
a missionary o f the German
Lutheran church established a Mission
among the Winnebagoes about
six miles from Black River Falls A lthough
quite a number were then livin
g there they owned no land Rev 
Hauser did not remain long and was
succeeded by Rev Jacob Stucki then
a young man who continued in active
service at the Mission for full
40 years A great dispenser o f charity
to old and destitute Winnebagoes
the Mission under Rev Stucki became
the center o f Indian activities
in the Black river valley When in
1882 the homesteads were granted
many of them were taken up within
a few miles of the Mission 
Right at the present time the Mission
is more the center of Indian activities
in the Black river valley than
ever before with probably more W innebagoes
living nearby than at any
other time The Mission is under the
supervision o f Rev Ben Stucki who
lives at Neillsville John Stacy David
Decorah and Alvin Stacy all W innebagoes 
are all active in the Mission
work and services are held regularly
in the old Mission church 
However the Mission church activities
are hardly responsible fo r the
many changes that have taken place
in the immediate vicinity during the
past five years In the fa ll o f 1933
a United States Indian Day school
was first started in the church building 
Then a fine two-room school
house was bu ilt and a dining room
and kitchen near by Next under the
supervision o f the Indian Bureau almost
a score o f houses have been
built for the old blind and dependent
Winnebagoes In addition to these
there are a considerable number of
other domiciles some distinctly primitive 
where the Indian families live
so that their children may attend the
day school

This Indian settlement is a very
interesting and instructive place to
visit There is now an excellent hard
road out from Black River Falls and
the distance is but six miles 
There is a W P A sewing project for
the Indian women and two work projects
for the men For about four
years nearly 60 of the Winnebagoes
have had such regular employment 
Jackson county grants the same old
age blind and dependent children
consideration in the way of pensions
to the Indians as to the whites Probably
the Black River valley Indians
have had better food and better clothing
during the past four years than
at any other time during the past century 
During the past winter there were
300 Indians living in the town of
Kamensky Jackson county Practically
all o f these were centered close
around the old Mission church In
Jackson county or but temporarily
absent were 365 Indians O f these
165 were children and 117 children
were attending school Forty-six were
too young fo r school while but two
were too sick to attend school Full
h a lf a hundred were enrolled at the
Indian day school (Hotonga) maintained
by the federal government 
and this was easily the most popular
educational institution both with pupils
and parents 
The Winnebagoes will have an In dian
village at the F air grounds all
during the big Black River Valley
Centennial and Homecoming Their
wigwams will be the same ones in
which they will live all summer long 
and life will go on just as usual 
Monday and Tuesday nights there will
be ceremonial and seasonal dances
and singing by the Indians in native
costumes These dances will be well
worth coming many miles to see 
W ith open house at all the wigwams
in the Indian village visitors will
have the opportunity to see the In dians
of the Black river valley just
as they really are after a century of
associations with the whites of the
valley 
THE W H IT E S
stopped long enough to construct a
flat-bottomed craft called a keelboat 
being 60 feet in length and five
in width in which the freight was
to be transported up the Black river 
Perhaps a description o f the manner
in which such boats are propelled
might be interesting it now being a
question o f the past but new to many
who may read this sketch Upon each
gunwale of the boat was fixed a running
board (so called) wide enough
for a man to walk upon comfortably 
without endangering his balance if
sober the boat being loaded with
perhaps ten tons of freight was headed
up Black river from L a Crosse
prairie with a crew o f seven or nine
men One steered while the others 
equally divided placed themselves on
the running board facing the stem
o f the boat each having a straight 
smooth pole from 10 to 15 feet in
length the but end resting on the bed
o f the river while the other end
found a lodgment firmly against the
shoulder the whole force and weight
of the man being exerted upon it as
he walked the running board in a
stooping position from bow to stern 
when the stern was gained the man
came to a righ tabout and reaching
the bow the poles were again set and
the power in question again exerted 
A bout 20 miles per days was good
progress up against the current For
years after the first settlement o f the
country the supplies for the settlers
were nearly all brought up the Black
river upon that class o f boats and to
be a good hand with a boat pole was
no slight recommendation as it required
a fu ll grown and well developed
man to endure the kind o f work
above described for fo ur successive
days that being about the average
time required to make a trip from La
Crosse prairie to Black River Falls 
The party completed and loaded
their boat started up Black river 
arriving at the Falls about the first
day o f August after a wearisome trip
o f seven days from the mouth o f the
river Twenty-eight head o f cattle
arrived at the same time having been
driven overland through the wilderness 
from Illinois Our
adventurers immediately on their arrival 
commenced and soon had completed
a double log cabin located on
the south bank of Town Creek north 
and a little east o f the present site of
Spaulding Block on Water street 
That done the party commenced getting
out timber for the frame o f a
small saw mill which was erected the
following spring on T jw n Creek 
very near the point where the bridge
now spans it 
Spaulding and Wood went down
the river to Warsaw Illinois and
there purchased the necessary iron
and machinery for their proposed
mill a t the Falls Spaulding in
charge of the material was fortunate
enough to get it conveyed by steam
boat to Prairie du Chien He then
hastened back to the Falls fo r the
boat herein before described with a
crew to transport the machinery and
supplies he had purchased 
Reaching Prairie du Chien he took
them aboard in a hurry as winter
was fast approaching and returning 
he reached Winneshiek then his boat
was frozen in hard and fast Finding
that winter was upon him in earnest 
he with a crew started on foot by
way of the river to the Falls a distance
o f 140 miles Arriving safely
about the first of January 1840 he
immediately set about preparing
teams for a trip to the boat Fifteen
o f what were called in those days
 moose sleds were hastily constructed 
calculated fo r a single ox as a
team having thills tied to a single
yoke I t was found that a team of
this description would haul 1500
pounds o f freight on the ice Everything
being ready Spaulding with
his moose train started down the
ice for Winneshiek arriving there
about the middle o f January and 
reshipping his goods from his boat 
he started back he himself acting as
pilot on the ice ahead o f the teams 
The party arrived at the Falls without
loss 
The country bordering the Black
river was found to be fu ll o f wild
game E lk were found the whole
length o f the Trempealeau Valley 
The creeks were dammed by beavers
at short intervals from source to
mouth 
D uring the autumn of 1840 Spaulding
and Woods commenced the erection
o f their second and larger mill 
and it was got in running order during
the spring o f 1841 During
the fall o f 1841 Spaulding moved
his family to the Falls from Prairie
du Chien his family at the time
consisting o f his wife and son Dudley
J a lad o f some six years The
same season however his family was
increased by the advent o f a daughter 
Mary j 
D uring 1841 a delegation of Mormons
came up from Nauvoo Illinois 
in order to procure lumber for their
temple and to that end and purpose 
they purchased a h alf interest in a
saw m ill some miles below the Falls 
In the spring o f 1843 Spaulding
sold to the Mormons the Falls mill
property for 20 000 payable mostly
in lumber On the 7th
day of June 1844 Joseph Smith the
founder o f Mormonism was killed by
a mob at Carthage Illinois His followers
at the Falls commenced preparation
for their immediate departure 
Spaulding at once took back
and became owner of the Falls property 
Late in the fall o f 1845 W T 
Price came to the Falls and the following
spring engaged himself to J a cob
Spaulding as foreman and clerk
at a salary of 300 a year and in that
position remained for several years 
ending with a salary o f 700 a year 
The first common school enterprise
on the Black river was started by
Spaulding in February 1847 The
school room was 9x15 feet in dimensions
and was lighted by on a window 
C R Johnson was engaged to run
the school at 12 00 a month and no
perquisits although allowed the privilege
o f boarding around among the
fortunate parents of children attendin
g school 
One day in March 1847 in the barroom
of the Shanghai House there
was a crowd o f 15 or 20 persons and
during an interval between drinks 
W T Price offered a resolution to
the effect that the services o f soma
kind of a preacher was imperatively
demanded The idea was favorably
received and the following summer 
in response to this application Rev 
R R Wood o f the Methodist Episcopal
church was sent to the Falls as
a stationed preacher 
During the spring and summer of
1847 sawed lumber sold at Dubuque
and Galena markets at 8 00 per
thousand feet paid for partly in cash
and part in supplies 
The June rise in Black river o f
1847 was the highest known to the
settlers being some 24 feet above
low water mark The large saw mill
o f Spaulding was carried from its
rocky foundation and the wreck floated
down the river with all the stock
o f logs intended for the summer s use 
During 1849 a state road was surveyed
through from Prairie du Chien
to Hudson being the first legal highway
in this part of the state The
following spring a post office was established
at the Falls with W W 
Bennett as postmaster United States
postage on a letter at that time was
25 cents 
Captain Johnson s writings cover
many intimate details of the life of
the white people o f the Black river
valley for 30 or more years longer
