FORTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN, THURSDAY, AUGUST 3, 1939 NUMBER 38
M ORE R E L IE F IN 1939
Although general relief decreased
during June 7.5 per cent from the
previous month, it was still 4.6 per
cent above the total for June 11*38.
The June relief case total, reports
the state welfare department, was
45.664, compared to 43 663 for the
same month of 1938.
However, relief rolls may be swelled
by former Works Progress Administration
workers. Phil D. Flann«‘r.
state WPA director, has announced
that workers who have not been dismissed
after 18 months of consecutive
employment are not assured of reemployment
after 30 days.
The new federal relief law provides
that WPA workers who have worked
for 18 months or more be dismissed
for 3ft davs at the end of which time,
if they have rot found work, t h ' ”
will be eligible for reassignment if
thev have been recertified.
Flanner stated that many workers
have the mistaken idea that they:
would automatically be tak n back
after the 3ft days, and he pointed out
that reemployment depended on quota
limitations and project needs.
However, he added that this provision
must not be confused with that I
covering private employment. Work !
ers are automatically reassigned to]
WPA after private employment for
which they originally left WPA if the
loss of work has been no fau lt of their
own.
MILK CONTROL FALTERS
Milk price control first enacted by
the 1933 legislature and since that
time reenacted by succeeding legislatures,
met defeat in the assembly
last week when a bill designed to
revise and extend the law was killed
48-33.
Unless the assembly reconsiders its
action or takes an opposite stand on
an identical bill which has been introduced
in the senate, milk price control
under the department of agriculture
and markets will expire Dec.
PI, 1939.
Before killing the bill the assembly
adopted several amendments which
prompted Ora Rice, Delavan Republican
and chairman of the house agriculture
committee, to declare the bill
worthless even should it pass. The
bill as amended would have provided
for establishment of producer’s and
retailer’s fluid milk prices in markets
in which a majority of producers
agreed to such price fixing; guaranteed
half the retail price to the producers;
maintained a ratio between
the prices paid the producer and received
by the retailer; maintained a
ratio between fluid milk prices and
general dairy prices; and permitted
farmers to sell unlimited quantities
of milk at unregulated prices on their
own farms.
ZIM M E RM A N OBJECTS
Secretary of State Fred R. Zimmerman
objected, but nevertheless the
senate passed a bill said to have Gov.
Heil’s approval which creates a separate
motor vehicle department in
which will be combined functions now
administered by seven different state
departments. The bill now goes to
the assembly.
The new department takes motor
vehicle registration from the secretary
of state’s office, headlight inspection
from the industrial commis.
sion, the safety division from the
highway commission, the licensing of
private truck carriers from the public
service commission, and other duties
now under the inspection bureau,
state treasurer, and the department of
agriculture and markets. The department
would be divided into three divisions
and would be headed by a
director and three subdirectors all
appointed by the governor with the
consent of the senate.
In a letter sent to every legislator
before the vote on the bill, Zimmerman
urged that the department be added
to the motor vehicle division now under
him. He opposed the creation of
a new department and the proposed
ruling of it by four persons in view
of Governor Heil’s campaign to supplant
three-man commissions with
one-man commissions.
C IV IL SE RV IC E ST REN GT H EN ED
All political parties in the assembly
agreed that a substitute civil service
bill, introduced by Speaker Vernon
Thomson of Richland Center, would
strengthen civil service in W’ isconsin,
and passed it by a 88-0 vote.
The substitute, offered to take the
place of a bill offered by Asemblyman
Goldthorpe. of Cuba City, is the
less drastic. Goldthorpe's bill would
have made the bureau of personnel,
which administers civil service in Wisconsin
responsible to the Governor’s
office, would have removed all part
; time employes from civil service; and
j would have set up a new personnel
| board. The Thomson substitute
amends the present civil service law
to correct alleged abuses.
Although all parties voted for the
bill, Progressives vigorously opposed
an amendment offered by Assemblyman
Heden of Ogema. Heden’s
amendment, adopted 62-30, provides
that no civil service employ of the
state shall be an active member of
any political party, shall contribute
money or anything else to a campaign
nor shall engage in any political ac_
tivity. Violation of the law shall be
cause for removal.
Progressive Andrew Biemiller, Milwaukee
argued that such an amendment
deprived civil service employes
of the right of freedom of expres-
•iun. He stated that under that provision
an employe could be removed
for political conversation. Mark Catlin,
Appleton, stated that the amendment
was necessary to prevent recurrence
of the political activity engaged
in by state employees during
the 11*38 campaign. Ernest Heden,
author of the amendment, declared
that it was necessary in order to divorce
civil service completely from
p lit ies.
Major changes in the civil service
law as passed by the Assembly are:
1: Forbids the appointment of any
person to the personnel board who has
been a candidate for a political office.
Board members must be U. S. citizens

H. S. Ap. Department
Gets New Building
A new building which will house the
high school agricultural denartment is
nearing completion on the Wittenberg
school grounds. Thi1 building is made
of stone and is thirty by seventy feet
in dimension. The interior of the
building is divided into two parts, a
classroom and a room for shopwork.
The building was; originally planned
for providing garage space and a
room for shopwork. but it was later
found that it would be advantageously
converted into a classroom and shop
with very little extra expense. A
course in shopwork. which is the third
year’s work in Smith-Hughes Agriculture,
w’ill be added to the high school
curriculum next year.
W’ittenberg High School is fortunate
in getting such a building as is
now under construction and in time to
come will doubtless have an agricultural
department 4hut will be second
to none in the state. The new classroom
will provide an excellent place of
meeting for both high school and evening
classes.
Clarence Bon/.ac, of the State Board
of Vocational and Adult Education,
was recently in Wittenberg and expressed
enthusiastic approval of this
new arrangement and commented on
the fine cooperation shown by the local
school board.
When completed and properly landscaped,
this new building will be an
addition of which Wittenberg can well
be proud.
E LD ERON F L OW E R SHOW
Next Sunday, August 6, a flower

WISCONSIN STATE FAIR,
NINE DAYS, AUG. 19 TO 27
Final details of the nine-day proj
gram of the Wisconsin State Fair,
Milwaukee Aug. 19 to 27, the most
I elaborate and largest in the 89-year
I history of the exposition, were com-
I pleted today, according to an announcement
by Ralph E. Ammon, man-
' ager.
Beginning with the opening day
Aviation and Citizenship Day, Saturday,
Aug. 19, entertainment and educational
features never before a t .
tempted by any state fair, will be in
order, Ammon pointed out. The day
also being National Aviation Dav,
the F air management has overlooked
no opportunity to make the observance
here national in scope.
Invitations have been sent hv Adjutant
General Ralph M. Immell of the
W’isconsin National Guard to the 32nd
division squadron, 33rd division squadron.
41st division squadron and the
108th division squadron to fly in army
formations at the fair grounds. This
will bring planes from Chicago, Detroit,
and Minneapolis. Pilots of
every privately owned plane in the
state also have been invited to fly to
the fair grounds.
The statewioe citizenship program,
the first one of its kind in the nation
will bring representative young men
and women who are about to reach
voting age from everv county to particinate
in an inspirational Americanization
program in the afternoon. A
sneaker of national prominence will
address them at 5 p m.
Earlier in the afternoon Jimmie
Lynch’s Death Dodgers and the 11
sensational circus acts will thrill the
grandstand crowds. Lynch and his
daredevils will duplicate the amazing
car crashing stunts which they originated
especially for the New York
World’s Fair, where they just completed
a long engagement.
The circus acts will be headed by
Dick Granere, the world’s most fa mous
precision flyer and aviation comedian.
Granere. a Canadian war ace,
gives exhibitions a few feet from the
ground that other daring aviators will
not attempt at an altitude of less than
1,500 feet.
The fair was also successful in
hookinr Power’s Elephants, an act in
general demand since its triumphal
engagement at the landon Hippodrome.
Requests that these dancing
elephants be returned were made by
many of the thousands who saw them
at the 1938 fair. High wire performers.
acrobatic clowns, tumblers, gymn
a s t s and dancers also are included
in the circus acts which will be seen
every dav during the fair.
At night the famous WLS National
Barn Dance will again broadcast its
4% hour ?how from the fair’s huge
«tage. For the first time in history
the fa ir has engaged a “big name”
band to play in its Modernistic Ballroom.
Sammy Kaye and his “swing
and sway’ orchestra were selected b e .
cnuse of their phenomenal rise in popularity
over the Mutual and Columbia
Broadcasting systems.
Kaye’s first appearance will be at
the Citizenship Ball, which will follow
the barn dance broadcast. Kaye will
announce the winner and play the
winning dance contest number. W'isconsin
amateur composers are being
urged to enter this contest by Ammon.
The composer of the best dance piece
will receive $100. Contestants may
write their score and lyrics on any
theme. The only requirements are
that the composers be amateurs and
residents of Wisconsin and that they
mail their entries to the Music Appreciation
committee. Wisconsin State
Fair, Milwaukee, before August 16
Kaye also will play Sunday, Monday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and the
second Sunday.
An every night feature will b* the

ARRESTS ONLY
ON COMPLAINT,
SHER IFF SAYS
Sheriff Carl Druckrey reviewed the
gambling situation in Shawano county
Monday morning and declared in a
public statement that his office would
continue the policy of making arrests
only on complaints.
“The conservation club officials Informed
me that they would enforce
the law,” he declared, referring to the
Sportmen’s Jamboree held here over
the week-end, “but they went ahead
and ran raffles and a bingo game anyhow.
I do .not believe it fa ir for one
form of gambling to be permitted it
others are not allowed.**
He said that he believed he had
done his duty in informing the club
officials and other officials throughout
the county in warning that there
might be trouble in the form of complaints
if games of chance were operated.
“I did that because numerous
persons had threatened . complaints
and I wanted to avoid trouble if possible.
Personally, I am not against
gambling for a cause like conservation,”
he stated.
Replying to a published report that
he had threatened a Bowler churck
group with arrest if they ran a bingo
game, the sheriff declared he had only
issued the same warning there and
throughout the county that the conservation
group received.
“ No matter where the money goes
or what form of gambling it is thejr
are all under the same law,” he pointed
out, adding that the law should b#
enforced completely or not at all,
with public opinion as the judge.
“ Arrests will necessarily follow
complaints,” the sheriff said, “but I
do not believe I should step in a eass
like this without signed complaints.”

WITH CLEAN HANDS
The Press is always glad to boost
whatever it thinks is for the g«x>d of
Blair or her people, always grsnting
that the cause is worthy. And thia
same endeavor and known intent on
the part of this newspaper brings us
some interesting visitors at timea.
Not long ago we were approached
by a young man who was in trouble
with the law and asked to “Keep it
out of the paper.” W’e did. Again,
we were approached by a woman who
asked us to “keep it out of the paper”
when her daughter was embroiled in
an unfortunate affair. We did. This
newspaper feels that it is doing something
worthwhile if we can shield
these misguided youth who get into
unfortunate positions. Wfe feel that
their own grief and that of their folks
is punishment enough without their
being held up to public scandal thru
this newspaper. Old offenders, however,
present a different picture and
are not worthy any defense.
But the individual who surprtsue a t
is the man like one who came to us
not long ago and asked us to publish
a diatribe which directly affected his
business. This man never spends s
dollar with this newspaper and even
sends out of town for most of his Job
printing. If the Press depended upon
his kind there would be no Blair Press.
Yet he resented the fact that we owed
him nothing and he would best grind
his own ax or pay for any publicity in
this newspaper. Funny how a newspaper
is “ no good” until some one
wants free advertising or wants something
“kept out of the paper."—II. C.

poisonous Republican upsurge of
recent weeks would rise to new
heights in 1940. Expecting the 49
additional seats they need for a
house majority, hoping for 16 new
senate seats to make themselves a
formidable minority, Republicans
had the makings of a persuasive
argument against the President’s
third-term ambitions. For if this
happens, neither Mr. Roosevelt nor
any other New Deal President could
do much.
Equally important was what had
already been done, not only by Republicans
but conservative Democrats
who found strength In coalition.
The record of one w’eek’s insurgence:
Labor Board. New Jersey’s Rep.
Mary T. Norton got out of her sick
bed to swallow bad medicine.
Strongest foe of the bill offered by
V irg inia’s Rep. How'ard W Smith
to investigate the national labor relations
board, she examined the record
and found Mr. Smith had never
cast a vote in favor of organized
labor. Thus, when the house voted
253 to 135 to probe N LR B and (by
custom) to place Representative
Sm ith in charge, she felt justified in
charging that he was "the last man
in the world to pass on labor legislation
or problems.” New Deal poison
here is that N L R B 's alleged shortcomings
publicized this summer and
next winter will focus attention on
the White House.
Hatch Bill. Passed by both senate
and house, the “ clean politics’*
measure of New Mexico's Sen. Carl
M. Hatch is designed to keep relief
out of political hands, and vice
versa. F ar more significant is that
portion which forbids federal office
holders from participating in national
political conventions. Since
400 jobholders attended the 1932 G.
O. P. pow-wow, and considerably
more the 1936 Democratic conven-
%tion, it is obviously the custom for
pro-administration wheelhorses to
write platforms and make nominations.
Thus the New Deal will suffer
at next year's Democratic convention
because Mr. Roosevelt's best
supporters may be absent.
Logan Bill. Passed quietly by the
senate, this measure gave federal
courts power to review acts of all
federal quasi-judicial bureaus (like
N L R B ), striking the most severe
blow at agencies created since 1933.
Result: Administration and executive
power would be b ad l^ crimped.
Though last-minute senate reconsideration
was possible, the bill was a
cinch to pass if it reached the house.
Lending. Labeled by critics the
“ pump-priming bill of 1939,” the
President’s pet $2,800,000,000 lending
program fell to $2,490,000,000
passing through the senate banking
committee where Federal Loan Administrator
Jesse Jones became so
exuberant in his praise for the bill
that his tongue slipped. When he
told the committee Reconstruction
Finance corporation could handle
the program two years with its present
borrowing authority, smart Republicans
jum ped into the breach
with a suggestion: Why, then, should
congress bother legislating an entire
new program when the same
purpose could be accomplished by
giving R F C a few new loan powrers?
In a sense this proved a Godsend;
such action would put a hasty end
to the last m ajo r measure still before
congress. That done, the President’s
friends could get out of town
u ntil next winter.
DOMESTIC:
Nose Count
On August 15 someone in St. Joseph
or Marshall county, Indiana,
will hear a knock on his door. The
1940 census will be under way, tested
at a cost of $20,000 prior to the
most complete statistical inventory
of the nation’s resources ever attempted.
Not until April will the
official count be made by 140,000
enumerators working two weeks in
urban centers and four weeks in
rural areas. But from preliminary
Indiana surveys the department of
commerce will pick key questions.
No. 1 aim of the 1940 census is
to check social trends. Since the
depression changed social and economic
status of most U. S. citizens,
special emphasis will be placed on
the following points:
Em ploym ent. Status of every citizen
over 14 years of age during the
week of March 24-30 will be checked,
answering queries of many federal
agencies.
Fertility. Great changes in reproduction
rates among regions and in
social classes have taken place since
CENSUS C H E C K E R AT WORK
She’l l record social trends.
1929. The census bureau hopes to
verify its hunch that few U. S. cities
are reproducing themselves.
Internal Migration. Depression
brought big population shifts as people
sought new jobs in new places.
Not only will the 1940 residence be
checked against 1935 s, but the bureau
will specifically check an awayfrom-
the-farm movement.
Education. Replacing the customary
illiteracy question will be one
asking the highest grade of school
completed, since illiteracy’s problem
is rapidly disappearing.

Sailing across the English channel

trade, the man who cemented R u m

before European peace rumors began
sprouting like wild oats:
‘Positive’ Plan. F irst rumor came

said Secretary Hudson would ask
Germ any to disarm in exchange for
a large British loan to transform her
industry from a war basis to a peace
basis—to h am m er her sword into a
plow share. Germany's war-lost colonies
would either be returned or
internationalized. The reported loan:
1,000,000,000 pounds. A few days later
London papers discovered Mr.
Hudson actually had made unofficial
loan proposals to Herr Wohltat. Foreign
office, London newspapers and
Commons immediately howled for
his resignation.
Siren of Berlin. With French-Polish-
British solidarity apparently an
actuality, there is every indication
Germany is “ testing the atmosphere”
with one thing in mind—further
appeasement. One government
spokesman said Berlin “ rejects a
warlike solution” to the Danzig
problem, thereby inviting peace conversations.
Nothing is definite, only
the time-tested “ give-us-what-wewant
- and - there -will - be - peace” form
u la which has never failed Der
Fuehrer yet.
Philadelphia Plan. F rom its Washington
bureau, the Philadelphia In quirer
published mysterious news of
a five-power plan which had leaked
from diplomatic circles. The plan:
Britain, France, Germany, Italy and
Poland would get 25 years of peace
by (1) returning Danzig to Germany
but leaving it a free port; (2) putting
Ita ly on the Suez canal board;
(3) neutralize African territory opposite
G ib raltar; (4) guarantee all
existing frontiers; (5) lim it armies
to 300,000. Within 24 hours every
nation concerned had denied the
rum or and gone back to its mid-summ
er grumbling.
Denials notwithstanding, rumors
would not float with such utter abandon
without some inspiration. International
observers took them as a
good omen of peace conversations,
but shook their heads in fear of
more British appeasement.

by a hym n tune, she stopped
before a building, listened to the
music of a melodeon, the lusty
chorus of m en's voices, and, at
length, draw n by a power greater
than her girlish tim idity, she mounted
the steps and so entered the
headquarters of the Boston Seamen's
Friends society. Thus destiny
took hold of Ja ne t’s life and
showed her the way to go.
Now Jane t Roper, house
mother of the Seamen’s Church
institute on South street, New
York, Is observing the fiftieth
anniversary of her work among
sailors, and there is hardly a
forecastle from the Cape of
Good Hope to Cairo, from John
O'Groats to the Ambrose Light
which does not contain at least
one shellback beholden to her In
any one of an infinite variety of
ways.
She is slender, almost frail of
physique. There are only a few
traces of gray in her h air for all
her 66 years, and her eyes snap
with intelligence, vitality and kindly
humor.
Several years ago Mother Roper
devised the idea of publishing lists of
missing seamen, copies being sent
to seamen's homes throughout the
world for display upon bulletin
boards. The service has obtained
extraordinary results. Sailors out
of touch with their families for
years have been located and contacts
restored, brothers have been
reunited in far-flung ports; all sorts
of happy things have been effected.
In all, to date, 5,327 sailormen supposedly
swallowed in the sea or forever
merged in the melting pots of
alien ports, have been recovered
from oblivion.
While in Boston, Mother Roper
met and subsequently m arried
a Congregational clergym
an, engaged in s im ilar service.
They worked together in
Gloucester, in Canada and In
Oregon until her husband's
death in 1915, when she came
to the Seamen’s institute on
Sooth street. She has no illusions
about sailormen, holding
them to be no better and no
worse than other men. Her
work, and her three daughters,
living with her in Brooklyn,
comprise her enthusiasms.

WASHINGTON. - Nothing interests
Washington so much as whether
President Roosevelt or P a ul V. McNutt
benefit more by the McNutt
appointment. The . McNutt people
are certainly pleased.
" I t 's like this,” said a close friend
of McNutt. “ You m ay intend to go
on a picnic next Thursday. You
have no doubt about it whatever.
The hot dogs and potato salad are
ordered. The site selected and the
time arranged. But Thursday morning
when you wake up it is raining
cats and dogs. Well—unless you
are a most persistent fellow—you
don't go on the picnic.
“ Most of us think that Mr. Roosevelt
fully intends to seek another
term. We think he is confident not
only of renomination but of re-election.
But next June it may be raining—
not cats and dogs, but maybe
anti-third-term sentiment or maybe
anti-New Deal sentiment. Then Mr.
Roosevelt m ay decide not to go to
the picnic. If he reaches that frame
of m ind our P a ul will be the logical
nominee.
" J u s t look the situation over and
try to put yourself in Roosevelt's
shoes if it should be raining next
June. N aturally he will want the
m an who succeeds him as President
to carry on the policies of the New
Deal that Roosevelt has fostered.
But what figure of sufficient prominence
in the Democratic party except
P a ul McNutt fits the picture?
When Jackson Flopped
F. D. R. Then Took I p Hopkins
“ We a ll knew that the President
was very m uch in favor of building
up Bob Jackson. Everybody knows
what the New York organization
leaders did to Jackson when the
President wanted him nominated for
governor of New York. They turned
h im down flat, and there is not the
slightest indication that he is any
more acceptable to them now than
he was then.
“ After the Jackson fiasco the
President’s choice seemed to be
H arry Hopkins. But, even aside
from the condition of H arry ’s health
it is generally realized by Democratic
leaders that Hopkins for various
reasons would not be a strong
candidate—and the men who will
do the voting at the Democratic convention
want to pick a winner. They
will want to keep their jobs.
"Everyone knows that the President
would never stand for John
Nance Garner. That just about
leaves Cordell H ull—always excepting
McNutt—for nobody thinks that
Henry Wallace would run well in
New York and New Jersey, both of
which are pretty nearly essential to
Democratic success. Incidentally,
the reason that Ohio and Indiana
elected so m any Republican congressmen
last year was dissatisfaction
in those two states with the
farm program.
"There are excellent reasons,
which we do not propose to discuss,
why Mr. H ull would not be a satisfactory
candidate next year. These
reasons are in addition to his age
and to the fact that in some parts
of the country his reciprocal trade
treaties are not popular.
"So all in all, remembering that
McNutt is a sm art politician and
therefore will certainly not break
with the President, who else is
there?—If it's raining.”
I ’resident tt ins When Wrong
And Loses tt hen He's Right
A surprising number of senators
and members of the house who have
been openly against President
Roosevelt on the neutrality issue are
privately for him . More accurately,
they think, and will tell their newspaper
friends, that the President is
right. But they hasten to add that
it is political m urder! Some of them
personally would be glad to see the
President stump his toe, politically.
Others would like to see him reelected.
There seems to be no party
line, and no factional line.
It is rather interesting, by the
way, that a cross-section of private
views of the congressmen is that the
President was wrong on the monetary
bill, is right on neutrality, and
hence, he has won on the issue on
which he is wrong, and lost on the
issue on which he is right!
But by far the m ajority of Democratic
members of the house and
senate knew perfectly well that their
constituents d id n ’t care a rap about
the monetary bill—that on next election
day no votes were to be won
because the candidate had fought
the President on that issue. Therefore.
if the individual senator or
m ember of the house were a Democrat.
and thinking simply of his own
selfish interests, it was obviously the
wiser course to vote with the President
on this measure.
But on neutrality, that is different.
In every state and probably
in every congressional district there
is an element which believes that
the sale of war supplies—particularly
arms, am m unition and “ implements
of w ar”—is not only wicked
but likely to involve the United
States on the side of the belligerents
to which they are sold,
View Neutrality as Most
Important Political Itsue
Moreover, a certain percentage of
these individuals feels so strongly
on the subject that, when election
day comes, they are apt to be controlled
in their voting by this one
issue alone. Which means that they
would vote against a congressman
who voted for the President on the
neutrality issue.
Obviously, to a person who thinks
that shipments of arms are apt to
result in his or her sons being sent
overseas to be m aim ed or killed in
a war in which that person has
only a remote interest, is likely to
regard the neutrality issue as the
most important political question in
the world, and to vote for or against
a representative or senator because
of his stand on that issue regardless
of how he m ay vote on other roll
calls.
It is these issues, on which m inorities
become so excited and on
which they are not likely to change,
that become No. 1 problems to politicians
who have to run for office,
always remembering that there are
exceptions to all rules, and that
some men on Capitol H ill will vote
for what they think is right regardless
of the consequences to themselves.
But this number, unfortunately,
or fortunately, as the case
may be, is so sm all that one need
not worry much about it in calculations.
After all, voting the way
one's constituents want one to vote
is the essence of representative government,
though it may be argued
that it is always a minority that
frighteni the politician. Only m inorities
are likely to remember an issue
with bitterness u ntil election
day.
Referenda in North Dakota
Is Studied in Washington
The vote in North Dakota on referenda
to provide money for increased
old-age pensions is being
studied very carefully in Washington
by both New Dealers and advocates
of a balanced budget. It presents
problems to both.
In close touch with the situation,
Sen. Gerald P. Nye of North D akota
was receiving figures next day
and insisting that it was really a
scrap between some seven political
factions, on the anti side, and that
headed by Ex-Gov. W illiam Langer
on the pro side.
When 839 precincts had reported,
the vote stood: against the gross income
tax, 99,355, for it, 14,313; for
state liquor stores to supplant the
present privately operated system
of liquor distribution, 16,874, against
96,536; for suspension of highway
construction for two years, 15,869,
against 97,535.
Whatever the political complications
may have been, the fact remains
that the voters of North D akota,
always regarded as a very
radical state, disapproved by a ra tio
of greater than six to one all
three proposals by which the increased
old-age pensions were to be
financed.
The increase in old-age pensions
from an average of $17.11 (it is calculated
on need) to $40 had been
pushed through the legislature by
Langer. Now it will fa il through
lack of revenue.
On the same day that reports from
the North Dakota election were being
received by senators, the senate
voted, 43 to 35, for an amendment
introduced by Sen. Tom Connally of
Texas to have the federal government
contribute to old-age assistance
payments in the ratio of two to
one instead of h alf and half.
Taxpayers Interested Only
tt hen Somebody Else. Payt
This favorable vote was recorded
in spite of an impassioned plea by
Sen. Harry Flood Byrd of Virginia
that the movement to have the federal
government pay all the cost of
old-age assistance was under way,
and that the Connally amendment
was the first step.
The really interesting part of all
this is that apparently tax-payers
will not vote to impose on themselves
taxes they can clearly see
for such a social purpose, but they
are all for them if they are convinced
that somebody else is paying
them. Most people believe that
the rich pay the federal taxes.
It is very difficult to combat this
view, especially to people who pay
very small federal income taxes or
none at all. And this goes even for
people who pay taxes on homes.
Many of these are terribly interested
in keeping the expenditures of
their home city down—they don’t
want the tax rate on their houses
boosted.
But it is a very simple matter to
prove that the overwhelming proportion
of federal taxes is paid by
persons with incomes under $5,000
a year. The proof lies in the fact
that if all the incomes from $5,000
a year upward were subjected to a
100 per cent federal income tax,
and the federal treasury really got
all this money, it would not come
within hundreds of millions of dollars
a year of paying the federal
expenditures.

And Mrs. Taine added, ln her
slow, precise fashion: "W e have no
information to give you. My mother
was in bed and asleep. I was
with her. My son Asa was asleep
in the dining-room. My husband
was at home. My son Kab was in
Providence. Miss Leaford was—I
don't know where. I knew nothing
till the electric lights went out, and
I started to look at the fuse-box,
and saw the flames from the pantry
window."
R a b insisted: "Gentlemen, you
can't annoy these ladies! They have
suffered—"
But Mrs. Taine said quietly:
“ Nonsense, Rab. It is not a question
of annoyance, or of endurance.
1 do not choose to be questioned;
that is all.” She repeated: "A n d I
wish this dangerous gossip stopped,
now.” She nodded toward the door
in a gesture of dismissal.
Tope said gently: “ I see you
burned your h a n d !”
Mrs. Taine eyed h im steadily.
“ Yes, when I lighted one of the
lam p s ,” she said. "The matchhead—”
But R ab cried bitterly: '"G e ntle men,

Tope looked to Inspector Heale
for guidance; and the other yielded.
So the two men came out together;
and out of doors, in the lee of the
house, sheltered from the rain,
Heale mopped his brow.
Chief Mason stopped, and turned;
and Tope with a nod toward the ruins
of the burned houses asked:
"Y o u think you can find anything
in there?”
“ It will be a piece of lurk if we
do,” the Chief confessed. “ Arson's
always hard to prove." He added:
“ There was a gas-exploaion, sure.
And by the way the flre tipped up
through that laundry-chule, I should
think oil had been poured down the
chute, or gasoline. It's not likely
we'll And anything, t u t we m ig h t."
And he said grim ly : “ But I 'll go
through the ashea with a sifter. If
there's anything there, I mean to
get it. Old Denman Hurder was a
gentleman. He always had a word
for any m an on the street. I liked
h im .”
" H e ’a still au v e ," Tope pointed
out.
“ He’s full of smoke, and gas too,”
Mason replied. "M u s t have had
enough gas to kill h im .”
“ No chance it was accident?”
Tope asked soberly.
“ Might have been,” the Chief
grudgingly assented. “ There was a
gas-leak somewhere. The cellar and
their room must have been full of
it. And crossed wires sputtering
might have set it off. The place
was a firetrap. Mr. Hurder had
had electric lights put in, with a decent
installation, but then the others
connected up to his line, and did the
work themselves. Poor job, probably.
It's a wonder they hadn't
had trouble before."
Tope nodded, and he asked: "Then
how do you know it wasn't just
crossed wires, and a leaky union in
the gas-line?”
The Chief said honestly: “ I don’t
know how I know. But when you've
been in this business as long as I
have, there are some fires that don't
im e ll right; that’s all. You get a
hunch they’re wrong, without knowing
why.”
The Inspector looked at h im approvingly.
He had observed something
of the sort himself, so many
times. He inquired:
"Chief, were you slow in answering
the alarm tonight?”
"D o n ’t think so,” the Chief assured
him . " I wasn't there, but
nobody said anything about a dela
y ."
" I ’d like to know what time the
ala rm came in ," Tope told him.
“ And what thne the first apparatus
got here.”
“ I ’ll get it for you,” the Chief
promised. He turned back to the
dying fire.
Tope and Inspector Heale went
on to the police car beside the road;
and Heale confessed in an irascible
tone: "W e ’ve got alm ighty little to
go on, Tope. No place to begin.”
“ I like to find out as much about
the time things happened as I c a n ."
Tope suggested. “ L e t’s drive down
right now and check up on that
telcphone-call. Nothing to do here
till daylight, anyway.”
Heale agreed; so they departed
on this mission. Heale phoned to
ask the Providence police to make
inquiries about R a b Taine; and they
got from Fire Headquarters a record
of the alarm . Then Providence
called back; Heale answered, and
reported to Tope, with a dry amusement:
"H e re ’s something! R a b Taine was
there, all right; but he wasn't alone.
‘Mr. and Mrs.' Registered in, under
his own name, late last night,
checked out about midnight, after
he got a phone c a ll."
Tope felt his pulses quicken; and
Heale commented: "P re tty eool
proposition, going off on a spree,
with his grandpa dead at home.”
He seemed to see no more in the
incident than an ugly intrigue, and
Tope offered no comment. So presently
they drove back up Kenesaw
HiU. There they could only wait,
while the embers of the Hurder
house still smoked and steamed. In spector
Heale went presently to
sleep, here beside Tope in the car.
A gray and miserable dawn came
a t last, through the drenched and
sodden trees to reveal the desolation
here. Where the Hurder house
had stood was a black pit now, with
embers and half-burned timbers
scattered all around. Firemen were
busy; and steam still rose from the
embers. Dawn became day. and Inspector
Heale woke, and took Tope
away to breakfast and brought him
back again.
They could only wait; and it was
near noon when they got back to
Kenesaw H ill. The Chief at last
came swiftly toward them, with
something in his hand. He extended
it triumphantly. “ There, look
at th a t !" he cried.
Tope saw what it was: a large
fuse of the sort used in electric circuits
designed to carry a considerable
current. It was a cylinder
“ You're fine, Miss Leaford,”
Tope said. "This is bard for you,
and I know it and understand."
some three inches long, with brass
or copper ends, of heavy waxed
cardboard composition.
At one place this tough composition,
harder than wood, had been
whittled with a knife till the soft
metal conveyer within was exposed.
This metal now was fused. The composition
was smutted all around the
opening. The whole was set as
though it had lain in water.
And Chief Mason cried triumphantly:
“ There you are! That’s
how it was done.”
Tope turned the thing in his hand.
“ Ju st how do you m e a n ? ” he asked.
And the Chief explained:
"Someone turned on the gas in
the cellar, let it run for a while;
then he short-circuited the light
wires, somehow, and blew this fuse.
The flash would set off the gas.”
And he added: " I t was a piece of
luck we got this. The explosion
must have blown it off the wall,
and it fell in a drain-ditch full of
water, didn't burn.”
Inspector Tope felt a quick premonition
of success. It was such
accidents as this which had betrayed
murderers before, and would
again. He looked at Inspector Heale
wondering whether the other had
the same thought; but Heale’s eyes
were fixed on someone a little distance
off, and when Tope swung
that way. he saw the m an whom
June had called Uncle J im approaching
them at swift long
strides.
He came near, and he cried:
"Where's—Miss Leaford?”
Heale said harshly: “ Where've
you been? I ’ve been looking for
you.”
Glovere made an impatient gesture.
“ Is she all rig h t?” he insisted.
Topi said gently: “ Yes, she’s all
right, Ir. Leaford.”
And at that word Heale swung
toward him, then back to the other
man. “ You Mr. Leaford?” he demanded
in a quick astonishment.
There was a long silence; the other
at last lifted his hand helplessly.
“ Yes. Yes. When Kitty died, I went
away . . . Came back yesterday.
But I didn't know about this till
just now.”
“ Where were you last night?”
Heale demanded.
" In m y cabin down there.”
"D id n ’t wake u p ? "
“ No. I ’d lost sleep lately.”
Heale made a gesture of satisfaction.
" I guess you're the man I
w ant," he said.
June's father stared at him with
narrowing eyes. “ What are you
talking about?” he demanded.
It was Tope who answered. “ We
think Mrs. Leaford was murdered,
think this last night was murder
too," he said.
And Heale added in a complacent
tone: “ So that's why I want you,
Mr. Leaford. You're going for a
little ride with m e.”
CH A PT E R X I I
Ju n e woke to strange surroundings;
to a room she had never seen
before, a bed she did not know. She
woke, and lay with wide eyes, rem
em bering; and for a while she
was content to stay abed, putting
her thoughts in order, assorting all
her horrified impressions of the
night before . . At last she heard
someone stop outside her door and
stand still there as though listening;
for a moment she shuddered with
vague terrors, then decided this
m ust be a friendly step, and called:
“ Come in.”
So Miss Moss opened the door;
and June saw kindness in her, and
strength and affection. The older
woman came gently to her bedside;
she said quietly:
“ Good morning, Miss Leaford.
Did you sleep well?”
" I must have, I think,” June confessed.
“ What time is it?”
"P a s t eleven," Miss Moss told
her gently. "Stay in bed. I ’ll bring
you some coffee."
But Ju n e sat up quickly. “ Oh, no.
So la te !" And she asked: "W here’s
C lin t? "
“ Sound asleep.”
" I s he all righ t?”
“ Yes; yes, m y dear. Perfectly.
Ju st a few burns and blisters.”
“ He was so brave,” June whispered
proudly; and Miss Moss said
smilingly:
“ He's sleeping like a child. He
took Inspector Tope out there last
night, after you went to bed; but
he came back soon himself, and I
took care of h im .”
June nodded. “ You’ve always
taken care of him , haven’t you?”
“ Since his mother died, yes.—O f
h im and of C lara.”
The girl insisted on arising; and
she and Miss Moss had a long hour
together before Clint woke at all.
moving quietly, speaking in halfwhispers
so that he might not be
disturbed. Once the telephone rang,
and Miss Moss answered it. June
heard her speak in a steady negation
to some insistent one, and
guessed the truth before Miss Moss
confessed to her.
“ That was your cousin," the older
woman explained. "M r . Taine—
wanting you to come home. He said
he would come fetch you."
“ R ab or A sa ? " Ju n e asked, almost
fearfully.
“ I don’t know.”
“ Oh, I don’t want to go,” the
girl declared. “ I can’t bear to go
back there.”
“ You need not,” Miss Moss assured
her calmly. "Y o u will stay
here as long as you choose, m y
d e ar." She smiled and lifted the receiver
off the hook. "W e 'll not even
ansver the telephone," she declared.
"Besides, it m igh t wake
Clint. He needs sleep.”
" I want to see h im ,” June admitted,
her cheeks bright; Miss
Moss smiled, and on a sudden im pulse
put her arm around the girl.
Later Miss Moss heard a buzzing
in the telephone, and it continued
so persistently that she lifted the
receiver. This was Aunt Evie, insisting
in her even, pitiless tones
that «une come home. But Miss
Moss yielded not an inch; and June,
when she heard who it was, cried:
“ I can’t, Miss Moss. Mother's
dead, and now Grandm a. Oh, I
can’t go back to them.”
Her voice was raised: it may have
roused Clint, asleep in Inspector
Tope's own bed. He came in pajam
a s to the door, his hair rumpled,
his eyes drowsy, still not fully
waked. But when June saw him
there, she ran into his arms, and
he held her close; and Miss Moss
said in a deep and tender m irth:
"She wouldn't be happy till you
did wake up, Clint. I couldn't please
her.”
June looked back over her shoulder
and said gratefully: "Y o u were
sweet to me. But—I did want Clint
too."
So June was able to forget for a
while those horrors of last night;
she and Clint and Miss Moss laughed
together over the breakfast-table,
and while they washed dishes afterward.
But early in the afternoon
Inspector Tope came home. The
old man was tired and worn and
haggard, and his clothes were sodden.
Miss Moss seized on him and
hustled h im , protesting, away to
change; she would have put h im to
bed, but the Inspector balked.
June asked Clint desperately:
“ What is it, dear? What has happened?
Why is he— that w a y?" And
suddenly: "W h y do you call him
‘Inspector’ ? Is he a policeman?”
“ He used to be." Clint told her.
“ For years." He thought uncertainly
to distract her attention; and hs
said almost eagerly: "H e can tell
you the greatest stories, about the
cases he had, the things he did. I
guess he's the greatest detective
they ever had around here.”
She stared at him with narrowed
eyes. "D etective?" she whispered.
“ But why—" And suddenly Clint
saw the blood drain out of her lips
and leave them white as m arbls;
but her eyes were steady. "C lin t,”
she demanded, "does he think—”
But he was saved the necessity of
answering, for Inspector Tope and
Miss Moss came out to them again;
and June turned to the older man.
" Y o u think someone killed my mothe
r? " she said swiftly.
Clint protested something, and Inspector
Tope stood uncertain; but
June turned to Miss Moss. “ Tell
m e ,” she insisted. "Is it true?”
Miss Moss answered her. "Yes,
Ju ne ,” she said. " I think it is true.”
Her voice was infinitely kind.
Ju n e ’s eyes closed; she seemed
to grow tall, she stood so straight
and still. She looked at them all
again, and said slowly;
“ You m ust tell me. Oh, tell me
what to do.”
Miss Moss and Clint were silent,
full of tenderness; but Inspector
Tope spoke in a deep approval.
“ You're fine, Miss Leaford," he
said. "This is hard for you. and I
know it, and understand. I would
like to talk to you,” he explained
gravely. " I f you can stand talk,
questions.”
Tope began with Mrs. Leaford; he
came at last to the tragedy of the
night before "Y o u r grandmother
died," he said. “ Mr. Hurder is still
alive. He ought to be in a hospital,
to have every chance; but Mrs.
Taine insists on keeping him there.
Attending him herself—”
He was silent for a moment,
frowning, foreboding in his eyes.
Then he went on:
"Now you've already told me
about your mother and the night she
died. You remember, when I cams
out with Clint. But Miss Leaford,
I want to ask you about last night—
about everything that happened before
you left the house to meet
C lint: who you saw, what you did,
what other people d id ."
So June, picking her words with
care,arranging her memories in order,
began to tell h im ; and while
she talked, he made an occasional
note, on a pad of paper, till she concluded
at last:
"A nd then Clint brought me away,
brought me in here.”
Inspector Tope nodded with a deep
approval. “ That’s fine,” he said;
and he explained: " I ’ve been trying
to figure out the times when some
of these things happened. I ’ve made
a schedule. Some of this you don’t
know about; but you and Clint look
at it and see if it's about right, as
far as you know.”

“Another Molly Pitcher”
He l l o , e v e r y b o d y ;
Today’* soul-stirring tale of a brave little mother who was
deathly afraid of guns, but afraid of nothing at all when corporation
hirelings tried to grab a piece of her home, is the Battle of
Monmouth all over again.
You remember, or do you, how in that important engagement
at Freehold, N. J., away back on June 28, 1778, Molly Pitcher took
the place of her husband, John C. Hays, an artilleryman, after he
was wounded, and served his gun, thus preventing its capture by
the British. That’s a yarn that every red-blooded American gets
a kick out of every time he reads it!
It is mighty comforting, I want to tell you, to know there are
Molly Pitchers in every generation, stepping forward fearlessly
to take the places of their men when necessary. Just such a
woman is today's distinguished adventurer.
Meet Mrs. John Doolin, of Lemont, IU., who did a good job
at writing her story, one that makes you feel all warm and
proud of our womanhood. They call women the weaker sex.
O yeah? Just put their backs to the wall. If you want the
proof, read how Mrs. Doolin, single-handed, whipped a rather highhanded
corporation that seemed to be trying to put over a fast one.
Not long after a railroad came through the village of Lemont,
where the Doolins had their home, there were a number of accidents
on a sharp curve close to the Doolin property. The company
wanted to straighten the line by putting it across the
Doolin yard. Surveyors staked out the new right of w a y ; workers
appeared and began digging. John Doolin ordered them off.
Then he took the first train to Chicago and there consulted his
good friend, Attorney Alexander Sullivan.
Actions of Company Held Illegal by Attorney.
M r. Sullivan told h im the company had no right to put its line on
Doolin property without permission. But, he continued (and here's the
catch), if the company succeeded in erecting the poles and stringing

Design Luncheon Mat
And Napkin Yourself
By RUTH WYETH SP E AR S
The luncheon m at and napkin
shown here offer a suggestion

Common Colds May Cause Infections in
Sinuses and Parts of Respiratory Tract
The common cold can cause infection
in the sinuses, other parts of
the respiratory tract and ears, Sidney
N. Parkinson, M.D., Oakland,
Calif., says in The Journal of the
American Medical Association.
Nasal congestion during a cold
interferes with circulation about the
openings of the sinuses. This increases
swelling and congestion
within the sinuses and permits accumulation
of mucopus which the
hair-like projections in the respiratory
tract are unable to remove.
This complication is unfavorable to
tissue defense.
"The purpose of local treatment
during acute infection is ventilation
in order to improve drainage ," the
author says. Shrinkage of the nasal
mucous membranes with drugs
opens the air passages. Free drainage
then takes place if in the process
of ventilation the hairlike d rainage
mechanism has not been d am aged,
This is why the selection of
a physiologic drug is so important.
Ephedrine in Locke's solution or its
equivalent constitutes an efficient
harmless agent for shrinkage.
The drug best reaches the m em branes
of the air passages with the
patient lying on his side with hi*
head bent downward exactly sidewise,
using the shoulder as a fulcrum.
After from three to flve minutes
the head is rotated to face down to
permit the nasal contents to escape
from the nostrils. The head-low
posture permits all important structures
within the nose to come in
contact with the medication and obviates
any injury.
Teeth of the Dog
Every dog regardless of size oi
breed has the same number of
teeth. Even in the Pekingese and
bulldog with their smashed-m faces,
though the teeth may be crowded,
crossed and crooked, there are always
42 and they are always in the
same groups and locations. All have
four canine or fangs, two in each
jaw , one in each corner with six incisors
or cutting teeth between
them, 18 p rcm o lari and eight molars
or grinders. The canine teeth
are the dog's weapons with which
he slashes his opponents and they
also help the incisors tear the carcasses
of his kill or large chunks

the power wire, the only thing Doolin could do would be to go to court.
John Doolin didn't have any money to pay for long years of litigation so
he beat it for home, resolved to keep the company off his premises.
There, sticking up in the lawn, was a nice new pole that had
been put up while he was in the city.
John sawed the pole half way through. Then he borrowed t
rifle and ammunition from a neighbor.
A few days later, on a bright June morning in 1903, a policeman
appeared with a warrant charging John Doolin with destroying public
i property. John marched away with the law, leaving three children crying,
a wife on the verge of it.
No sooner was John Doolin out of sight than a crew of workmen
I swarmed on the place and began digging so furiously you would think
they were being paid a dollar a shovelfull. Was little Mrs. Doolin going
j to let them get away with it? Up to the attic she hurried. There, forgetting
she shivered at the very sight of a firearm, she took from the
wall a shotgun that had hung undisturbed for many years.
With her children clinging to her and crying again, she
opened the window shutters, and rested the ancient fowling piece
on the sill. Then, in a cold fury, she called down to the working
men:
“ Throw down your tools or I'll shoot!”
They stopped working and began to kid her.
Foreman Orders Men lo Take Gun From Her.
Then one bully, who appeared to be the foreman, ordered: “ Come
on, guys, let's go up and take it away from he r." Mrs. Doolin leaned
• little farther out of the window and lifted the rusty shotgun.
“ The first man who takes a step toward my house gets shot," she
called. “ Now all of you drop your tools or I ’ll start shooting."
And boys and girls. Mrs. Doolin meant exactly what she said.
She was a determined mother, protecting her home and babies
in the absence of her husband. Of course, she thought the gun
wasn't loaded, hut her finger wss on the trigger and sbe was all
set to pull It if any one of those men made a move in the d irection
ol the house. But their tools went down.
The workmen sensed this was real d ram a, not u comedy, and they
became sober. One spoke up to say the company had sent them there
to rush up a couple of poles. Plucky Mrs. Doolin then explained to them
that they were on her property, that the company had not asked permission
to use it' nor offered to pay for it.
Well, sir. when those men got the low down on the proposition
they took off their hats and cheered. “ You win. lady, you're
a game g uy ," they told her. "We aren’t doing any more digging
nntil you get a square deal.”
With that they picked up their tools and went to town. Mrs. Doolin
had won her battle, but would the men be back tomorrow? Would the
company have her arrested for threatening i u workmen? And what had
become of her husband?
Officials Refuse to Prosecute Doolin.
Pondering these questions, Mrs. Doolin went to the door and
w is overjoyed to see her husband coming up the walk, lie hadn't
been In ja il at all. The policeman had taken him before a justice
of the peace, but no on* in the courtroom was willing to prosecute
him . He thought he understood why he bad been taken sway
on a charge no one would pcess when Mrs. Doolin told him the
men had been bark. But when she told hhn how she had pointed
the shotgun at them and really Intended to pull the trigger, he
felt a little faint. For that old gun was loaded!
Well, there was one thing about the old-fashioned corporation, it
always knew when it was licked The very next morning the worries ;
of the Doolin fam ily were over. Might after breakfast two suave lawyers
called to say how sorry they were it had happened. There had heen

C l T VACATIONS
In line with Governor Heil's sugges
tion the senate has parsed and sent
to the assembly a bill which cuts state
employes’ vacations with pay from
three weeks to two weeks. The bill
would take effect in 1940.
The proposal in the form of an
amendment was tacked onto a bill
which originally would have prevented
state employes from taking vacations
during the 30 days preceding a general
election to keep men from campaigning
The bill was amended to allow
vacations during the period, provided
the bureau of personnel submitted to
the legislature, within 10 days of the
convening of each session a list of
the state workers who took their vacations
during “campaign time.”
IT’S GREATEST CH ALLENGE
Wisconsin’s new board of ag ricu l.
ture believes that adequate inspection
of dairy plants and adequate grading!
of cheese is the greatest challenge
facing the department of agriculture
and markets.
Therefore, at one of its first sessions
the new board, in conference with
Gov. Heil, asked that a sufficient appropriation
be forthcoming to make
it possible to render satisfactory service
in inspection and grading of
dairy products. A bill granting the
department $80,000 annually for this
purpose has been passed by the assembly
and now awaits senate action.
In a letter to senators Ralph Ammon,
director of the department of
agriculture and markets, declared
that members of the board are of the j
opinion that at least ninety per cent
of the farmers and 90 per cent of the
dairy plants in Wisconsin want to;
produce high quality products, and j
that most of them are producing high
quality products, but that the majority
are greatly handicapped in competition
with the minority that flaunts the
laws and regulations for sanitation
and grading

“Oh, you know me, call home,” the
old chap would plead. And true
enough, the operator knew his voice
just as she knows all the voices on her
line and she called “ home”.
Many a time the telephone operator
has to endure in silence the impatience
of a patron putting in a call. We recall
an incident of this nature. A big
business man was very anxiou^ to put
through a long distance call and was
unable to get his party as expeditiously
as he wished. In his frustration he
lashed with furious words the girl who
was vainly attempting to accommodate
him. She asked him to control him self:
and he snapped, “ Keep your shirt
on!”
The girl reported the incident to the
president of the telephone company,
who visited the business man and told
him that either he apologize for his
conduct or they would discontinue his
phone. Unwillingly the business man
agreed to apologize. He called the
operator in question.
“Operator 8? This is Mr. Smith.
Well, you can take your shirt off now.”
That was his apology. Central had to
accept it with the best nature she
could muster.
When there is a fire, when sickness
demands the presence of a doctor, we
ring central, and she by her trusty
magic connects us with our party.
Because we appreciate the service
so cheerfully and willingly given us by
the girls who are at the switchboard
day and night, to them we dedicate our
column this week. The days are fast
going by and when school opens one
of the friendly voices at the “central
office” will be gone. To her we extend
our very best wishes and our thanks.
May she continue to serve as well in
making good connections between her
husband and the towns people of Deerbrook
as she has served in making
good connections for many friends
here in Wittenberg!
To our Wittenberg Telephone Co.
we say: “ We appreciate good service
and we have it ! ”

Rheumatic Pain Attacks!
A PERSONAL MESSAGE for Every Man and Woman who is distressed
with Rheumatic, Neuritic or Neuralgic Pain Attacks, or who has friends
who are, this Information may be of VITAL IMPORTANCE!
Dear Friend:
Here is good news that may mean
happiness for you if you suffer from
Rheumatic, Neuritic, or Neuralgic
Pain Attacks.
You know what it means to your
work— to your family— and to your
own enjoyment and happiness, to
find relief from these pain atacks.
That is why we are Happy to bring
you this Good News about RU X Compound.
Flocks of people come into our
store every week .and ask us to take
time off to tell them about RUX,
that they have heard so much about.
W’e are glad to do this, and it is with
the thought of passing information
on to you who have not yet come to
our store for this fine medicine, that
we are presenting this message.
Thousands of people over the country
are users of RU X , and words of
gratitude for the relief it gives in
Rheumatic, Neuralgic and Neuritic
Pain attacks are heard on every side.
We believe the following letter from
Mr. Herman Koehler, well-known residen
of Green Bay, Wis., expresses
how others feel about RU X and shows
MR. H ERM AN K O E H L E R
how they praise it to their neighbors
and friends. Mr. Koehler says:
“ I am writing this statement for
the purpose of telling other Rheumatic
Pain sufferers how much RU X Compound
helped me. For some time I
have been having Rheumatic Pains in
my legs and hands. A t times it
would feel as though someone were
jabbing me with a sharp knife. I
heard of RU X Compound and decided
to try it. I can say that RU X certainly
helps me in relieving these pain
attacks. I can recommend RUX highly
for what it has done for me.”
This is but one of the many, many
letters received bv the makers of
RUX. praising this remarkable medicine.
and although this sufferer’s
experience may not be in the least
like yours, we want you to know that
praise for RUX is sincere and is
given freely so that you and other
people will hear about RUX and be
able to try it for yourself.
When relief from Rheumatic, Neuralgic
or Neuritic Pain may mean so
much to your happiness, and even
your success in life, surely you owe
it to yourself to at least learn more
about this remarkable medicine, RUX.
We are daily meeting people in our
store and showing them The RUX
and telling them about how its valuable
ingredients act. When you deride
to try R U X— today or tomorrow,
if possible— come into our store and
we will be glad to tell you about this
fine medicine which is bringing relief
and comfort to many other sufferers.

We ran across this parody today
and think perhaps it contains a happy
reminder for a good many of us.
There Can’t Be Too Many
How dear to our hearts are the steady
subscribers
Who promptly renew at the end of
each year.
Who send in their names and their
money quite gladly,
Who cast ’round our Sanctum a halo
of cheer.
They never say, “ Stop it, I cannot
afford it.
I ’m getting more magazines now than
I read.”
But always say. “ Send it, our folks
seem to like it;
We think it a help and it meets a
great need.”
We inwardly bless them and outwardly
thank them
Those steady subscribers who write,
“Yes, indeed!”
How about it, folks? Have we renewed
our subscription? We do enjoy
The Enterprise and we’d hate to have
it discontinued, eh?
We’ve been thinking considerably
lately—now, now, don’t be so surprised.
We do think occasionally—
how much other people do to make us
comfortable and to lighten our tasks.
Perhaps it’s the new voice in the
telephone office has set us thinking.
Often have we marveled and often
have we been thankful for the helpfulness,
patience, and good nature of
the telephone operator. Never have
we found her unwilling to help.
There have been times when it has
been necessary to locate a member of
the board of an adjacent village. Must
one call several strangers in the effort
to locate the board member? No, indeed,
not in Wittenberg. Central
merely says, “I ’ll get in touch with
your man and give you a ring when I
have him.” As simple for you and
me as that . . and she’s as good as
her word. Seldom does she become
impatient.
One old codger in a certain town
used to ring central and say in answer
to her “ number please” — “Call
home.” Trying to make her voice
stern, she would say:'“ You must give
me the number, what number please?”
Wittenberg: Defeats Kelly
Pounding two pitchers for a total of
twenty-three hits and sixteen runs,
the Pilots smothered that team Sun-1
day on the local diamond 16 to 4.
Palladeau pitched a good game for
the Pilots; besides holding Kelly well
in check until his team-mates had a
good lead, he contributed offensively
with three line drives which figured a
great deal in the scoring.
Donnie Gunderson, as usual, turned
in a fielding play that was a beauty,
on Young's hopper back of the pitcher.
Sunday the Pilots will play Aniwa
at Aniwa.

“Cheap” house
paint is a lu xu ry
for the rich man only
If you here loads cf money . . . if you can afford
to buy twice as many gallons . . . if yoa
can pay this coat of burning or scraping off the
old paint every two years or so and the
added coat ot frequent repainting . . . then
yoa are rich enough to use a “cheap,” low
price boose paint.
A lt if you want to make every dollar count
—to get value for your money—-then you’d
better buy the best bouse paint money can
buy—SWP. It costs no more in tbe beginning
—and much less in the end.
Come in and let us tell you the truth about
the exorbitant cost ot “cheap” paint.

Even if father had bought those

In these days by merely

day last week. Miss Goderstad. who
has been a subscriber of the Home
paper, “ For Gammel og Ung,” for
many years, became interested in the
Home from reading the paper every
week and even had become familiar
with manv local names, so she did not
feel exactly like a stranger here.
Oscar Berbnum, Fred Schwartz and
Robert Rothlisberger,' of Detroit,
Michigan, arrived here Saturday by
wav of the copper country for a visit
in the Wm. Berbaum home. Saturday
evening, the three visitors and Mr. and
Mrs. Berbaum motored to Manitowoc,
where Mr. Rothlisberger took the boat
for Michigan, his vacation period having
about ended. The others returned
here and Oscar and Mr. Schwartz remained
for a longer visit here and are
leaving for Detroit tomorrow morning.
Through a mechanical error difficult
to explain we omitted last week to
mention the name of Mrs. E. L. Gates
with thnt of her husband in the news
item of the party’s return from their
eastern trip. We all know, of course,
that they would be the last couple in
town who would not be together on a
trip of that kind, so the mistake was
spotted by local people at once as a
sure misstatement of fact. Making
such mistakes is one of the griefs of
the business and it only happens when
the mind lapses for the fraction of a
second during the reading of “ proofs.”

likely to establish feeling of
in fe rio rity by “ bossing"
younger playmates. All youngsters
should be taught the
pleasure of wholehearted,
friendly co-operation.
By LAURA GRAY
*•¥ CAN’T understand m y small
4 son, Teddy," complained Mrs.
Bacon to her neighbor, Mrs. Morton.
"E v e ry tim e he goes to play with
Robert, Teddy comes back so cross,
so irritable, I can do nothing with
him. And he used to be such a
sweet-tempered youngster.”
“ Robert's older than Teddy, isn’t
he?” asked Mrs. Morton.
"O nly a year and a half, but he
looks three years older; he's so big
and sturdy. Robert’s mother and I
have been taking charge ol the two
children on alternate days. This
gives each of us every other day
free.”
“ What a clever arrangement. But
perhaps the boys see too much of
each other. How do they get on
when Robert comes to your house?”
“Oh, they scrap a little; I don’t interfere.
B ut this morning Teddy
made a great ado about going to
play with Robert. He d idn’t want
to go.”
"W ell, there are some peoplemuch
as I love them — that I
wouldn’t want to spend every day
w ith ." mused the neighbor. “ I
should say, in this case, that the
older boy is wearing out the little
fellow. H aving always to give into
subject one’s own wishes—becomes
monotonous.”
“ I wonder if you are right.”
Next day, when six-year-old Robert
came to play with four-year-old
Teddy, his mother, in the next room,
was alert to note what went on.
“ Let's play tr a in !” suggested Robert,
sweeping things from a sm all
table and jerking it upside down.
“ No. I want to cut out p ictures!”
pouted Teddy, already comfortably
seated in the midst of litter.
“ Oh. come o n !" Robert snatched
the scissors from the little fellow.
“ You m ay be e ng in em an!”
Storm Stepped Temporarily.
This magnificent condescension
stopped the im minent storm of protest
from Teddy. He jum ped up and
willingly helped arrange chairs behind
the table. "G oing to be enginem
a n ! Going to be e ng in em a n!” he
kept repeating.
"Y o u m ay be engine driver after;
I'm going to be first!” The bigger
boy seated himself on top of boxes
at the head of the procession, and
mimicked escaping steam with vivid
reality.
Teddy reluctantly took the seat
behind. At last the steam gave out.
“ My turn now !” he cried
“ No, let’s play something else!
This is no fu n !” The "s te am ”
jum pe d down and wrecked the
train!
The boys went into the garden.
Robert rushed to the shed, took out
Teddy’s new tricycle and kept it the
rest of the m o m in f. How the owner
longed to enjoy his new toy! H e’d
had very little chance as yet—the
boys being almost always together.
And so the day went on, the older
boy's wishes always being carried
out, and the younger never experiencing
that satisfaction with regard
to his own. No wonder poor Teddy
was worn out with giving in!
" Y o u ’ll have to tidy u p ! " trium phantly,
at the end of the day, " I
always do when you come to play
with m e !” Robert beamed at the
playroom that looked as if a cyclone
had passed through it.
At last he was gone!
H alf a day or even a whole day
together, once in a while, would have
been a good experience for these
boys, but every day was too much.
And we should all remember, too,
that while some unsupervised play
is beneficial for young children, the
periods should not be overlong.
No child should be "under-dog”
all the time. This is apt to establish
an idea of inferiority, not easily
eradicated. Neither is it good for a
more vigorous child to have hia own
way always He should be taught to
be fair, and learn that there can be
real pleasure in giving in.

F l u r r y o f E x c i t e m e n t i n C h u r c h
One Sunday during the summer
of 1917 the President suggested
that we drive quietly over to Virginia
and attend the service at the
Pohick church, which was the
place of worship of George Washington.
When we arrived, the little
edifice was well filled. Mr.
Wilson, m y brother Randolph and
I were escorted to the Washington
pew, given prayer books and left
to ourselves. The service over,
we were accompanied to the door
by a member of the vestry and
permitted to depart without any of
the crowding about which usually
attends the appearance of a President
in public. Also I was im pressed
by the large congregation,
for it was raining.
Afterwards Mr. Jervis, one of
the secret service men, asked:
Roman Dogs
The Romans divided their dogs
Into six groups, the canes villatici
(house dogs); canes pastorales pecu
arii (shepherd d o gs); canes venatici
(sporting dogs); pugnaces or
bellicosi (pugnacious or war d o gs);
nares sagaces (dogs which ran by
scent) and pedipus celeres (swift
dogs which ran by sight). In the
United States, writes M argaret K id der
in the Los Angeles Times, we
have a sportmg-dog group in which
are the bird dogs; a hound group,
including both the scent and the
sight hounds; a working-dog group,
which takes in the shepherd dogs
and the dogs that the Rom ans
termed war dogs; a terrier group,
which had no counterpart in Rom an
times; a top group, which unaccountably
was missing in Rome,
since tiny pots were popular among
the ruling classes, and a non-sporting
group, which no doubt incluaes
some of the breeds that the Romans
listed as house dogs.
‘M” for Noon
According to the United States
Naval Observatory 12:00 M is almost
universally used to designate
12:00 o’clock noon. M in this
connection is an abbreviation of
"M e r id iem ,” the accusative of the
L atin “ m e ridie s," m eaning m id day.
“ May I tell you a story?” This
is the story:
Knowing our plans, Mr. Jervis
had reached the church at 9:30,
finding it closed and not a souh
about. At the nearest house he
inquired whether there was to be
a service. The m a n did not know,
but said that the Dreacher was
holding Sunday school at his own
home and that Jervis m igh t inquire
of h im . At the minister's
house Mr. Je rv is found a young
m an instructing a group of barefoot
girls and boys. Jervis asked
the m an whether there would be
a service at the church, because
the President had intended to
come. “ The President of w h at?”
asked the clergyman. “ O f the
United States," replied Jervis.
The minister looked at his caller
sorrowfully. "Y o u n g m an , are
you ill? ” he asked.
Jervis showed his badge, adding
that the President and Mrs. Wilson
were due in an hour. The
minister clapped his hands. "C h ildren,
Sunday school is dismissed.
A ll of you run home and tell your
fathers and mothers the President
is coming to church and I want
a good congregation to welcome
h im .” Then he turned to Jervis.
Wise and Otherwise
If your garden is fooling you, give
it a few din* in return.
If omen can give everything with a
smile and tuke every thing back with
a tear.
Every dog ha* his day, says the
proverb. And, judging by the row in
my back garden, every cat ha* her
knight.
“Pur ents are often a hindrance to
children in a career,” says a judge.
Perhaps—but the children could
hardly start a career without them.
A seaside worker tells me he gets
$2.50 • day for picking up litter. A
tidy sum?
Did the guy who said “honesty is
the best policy" ever try telling the
boss what he really thought of him?
Hank aaya hi* wife's new diet has
fairly took her breadth away!
“ Young m an, I m ust shave. You
run over to the church and
tell the sexton to ring the bell—
vigorously.” At the church Jervis
found the old sexton opening the
door. He gave the m iniste r’s message.
The sexton’s mouth stood
open for a minute. Then he said:
“ Here, you ring that bell. I t ’s
just outside in a tree. I got to go
home and shave.” —E d ith Bolling
Wilson in The Saturday Evening
Post.

A familiar sight along the shaded streets of Goshen are the trotting

monument in the background is to the memory of Henry Winter,
member of the first and second continental congress. Although the
community of 2,900 souls notv rests almost under the shadow of metro*

distinctly American sport. Each years Grand Circuit season and other
races bring them flocking et'en as Englands famous Derby brings turf

First Milk Bar Set Up—What sponsors
declare is Wisconsin’s first milk
bar, patterned by Governor Heil’*
Milwaukee idea, was set up in a
Marshfield store.
Can’t Divorce Insane—The assembly
killed a bill which would have
established as grounds for divorce
the confinement of one’s mate in an
institution for the insane for a period
of at least five years.
Twins Born Three Days Apart—
Twin daughters of Mr. and Mrs. A lfred
Blick of Belgium arrived three
days apart at St. Nicholas’ hospital
in Sheboygan. One was born on
Wednesday and the other on Satur*
day.
Dragged to Death by Horse—Jacob
Romdalski, 14, was dragged to death
at his farm home near Independence
when a horse whose halter rope he
had tied around his body became
frightened as he watered it and ran
away.
Job Bureau Sets Record—The state
employment service announced that
it had found jobs for 4,380 persons
during the first six months of this
year, setting a new high total for
similar periods. Placements were
more than double those of the same
months of 1938.
Will Celebrate Jo intly—Officers of
the C IO and A F L labor councils in
Racine have announced that they
expect to hold a joint Labor day
celebration this year. A joint observance
was planned for last year,
but fell through when the twfo groups
could not patch their differences.
Beer Ban Bill Killed —The assembly
killed a bill to prohibit sale of
beer at the Memorial Union Rathskeller
on the University of Wisconsin
campus. The bill was aimed
principally at the university, but also
forbade the sale of beer or liquor at
any educational institution supported
wholly or in part by the state.
Buckman Assets May Yield 3c—
Assets of B. E. Buckman and Co.,
defunct Madison investment firm
whose principal officers are serving
prison terms for securities law violation,
may yield general creditors Mb
to 3 cents on the dollar, according to
an optimistic estimate made by S. B.
Schien, trustee in bankruptcy.
Slot Machines Must Go—Because
human life w'as endangered by the
hijacking activities of armed bandits,
Dist. Atty. McEvoy and Sheriff
Schend declared war on slot machines
and other gambling devices in
Kenosha county. The order followed
hijacking of five slot machines from
the Kenosha Country club by three
armed men.
Rules Against Law Challenge —
Circuit Judge A lvin C. Reis upheld
an order of the state department of
agriculture extending the Janesville
regulated m ilk market from one to
five miles beyond the city limits. The
department issued the order effective
Ju ly 1, to prevent cut rate competition
by m ilk stands which operate
immediately outside the one mile
limit.
Favor County License System—
The senate engrossed an assembly
bill providing for distribution of automobile
licenses by county clerks.
Senators favoring the change argued
that it would save money. Opponents
recalled that former Governors
Kohler, Schmedeman and La Follette
vetoed similar bills, and that
the voters rejected the plan in a
1931 referendum.
Senate Passes Regents B ill — The
Roethe bill to abolish the present 14
member board of regents of the U niversity
of Wisconsin and set up a
new nine member board, all of
whom would be appointed by the
governor, was passed by the senate.
The senate also passed the Zimny
bill, which would reduce passenger
automobile license fees by 50 per
cent, and sent the measure to the
assembly.
Joins Legion at Tender Age —
Grover F. Cleveland, Jr., is the
youngest member of the Sons of
American Legion in the world. Grover
doesn’t appreciate the distinction.
He was only one-half hour old when
he was inducted into the SAL, auxiliary
of the D J. Martin American
Legion post at Waukesha. A nurse
signed his name to the membership
card by pressing his feet on an ink
pad and then on the card.
“Treasure Chest” Illegal — Bank
night, by any other name, is still a
lottery in violation of Wisconsin
statutes, in the opinion of Atty. Gen.
Martin. Appearance of “treasure
chest" nights at a theater at Kenosha
after bank nights had been
banned prompted Dist. Atty. McEvoy
to request the opinion, ^he theater
advertised $200 would be given to
someone who registered at the theater
or at stores participating in the
scheme.
State Budget Must Balance— Governor
Heil renewed his determination
to balance the state budget and
outlined a program of reorganization,
taxation and economy to achieve
it. The governor, in his second message
to the legislature which has
been in session since January, asked
the legislature to enact his proposals
as soon as possible. Heil appeared
before a joint session of the senate
and assembly and read his message.
Greatest comment was prompted by
his proposals to fire approximately
1.300 of the state s 13,400 employes
and to divert $3,000,000 of truck and
bus license revenue from highway to
general state purposes.

PICNIC BASKET A PASSPORT TO FUN
(See Recipe Below)
Let’s Have a Picnic!
When skies are blue and cloudless
and the weather’s warm , a pic-
! nic basket is the passport to fun.
It may be a spur-of-the-moment picnic
with a simple lunch prepared
j from supplies on hand in pantry
and refrigerator; or it might be a
steak fry or barbecue with the food
i cooked on the picnic grounds; but
it’s more likely to be an old-fash-
! ioned “ fam ily style” picnic for a
I half-dozen to a hundred hungry
guests w’ith plenty of good-tasting
food of delicious variety.
Whether your picnic is planned
for a family,
a Sunday school
class, or a lodge,
you’ll find these
foods prime favorites
with the
guests. Recipes
are given here
in quantities to
^ serve a fam ily;
**’ for a larger
number the difference
is a simple process of m u ltiplication.
Cream Salad Dressing.
1 teaspoon mustard
1 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons flour
\Vi teaspoons sugar
Dash cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon butter
1 egg yolk
% cup vinegar
Vz cup heavy cream
Mix all dry ingredients together
thoroughly. Add butter, egg yolk
and vinegar. Place in double boiler
and cook, stirring constantly, until
mixture thickens. Cool, fold in
cream (stiffly beaten) and serve
with cabbage salad.
Baked Beans
(Serves 6)
1 pound navy beans
i* pound pork (from the shoulder)
3 cups water
% cup brown sugar
6 tablespoons molasses
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dry mustard
Soak the navy beans over night in
water to cover. In the morning cut
the meat into 2-inch pieces and
brown well. Add the 3 cups water,
and cook slowly for about Vi hour.
Add beans and continue cooking for
2 hours, or until both meat and
beans are tender. Add remaining
ingredients. Place in a baking dish,
and bake in a moderately slow oven
(325 degrees) for about l xk hours.
I f necessary, add more water to the
beans while cooking.
Cam p Coffee.
E arly in the day measure the coffee
into a sugar bag, allowing 1 ta blespoon
per cup.
Place this in the
coffeepot with a
little cold water

INVENTOR RAN B IC Y C LE
R E P A IR SHOP
THE seed of success is ambition,
and Orville Wright was am bitious
from early boyhood. He was
born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1871, the
youngest of five children, and as
they grew up Orville and one of his
older brothers, Wilbur, became inseparable.
A highly respectable
mid-western fam ily, the father was
a bishop of the United Brethren
church and later publisher of a religious
newspaper; bat the family
never had a lot of money. O rville
Wright started to make money
early in life, going about the neighborhood
and collecting old bones to
sell to a fertilizing plant. When he
was fourteen, he published a school
paper with a toy printing press. Later
he made a press of his own and
Wilbur improved it. Next he invented
a paper folding machine for his
father’s print shop. He quit school
in the third year of high school and,
with Wilbur, started a weekly newspaper
which lasted only three
months. They then turned to job
printing and later started a bicycle
repair shop.
At about this time, ttiey oecame
interested in aviation and proceeded
to construct the first heavier than
air machine large enough to carry
a man. As in their previous activities,
Orville was the creative genius,
Wilbur the perfecter. Their
first successful flight was at Kitty
Hawk, N. C., in 1903, and the success
of aviation was assured when
Orville made a flight lasting 62 minutes
and 15 seconds, in 1908.
