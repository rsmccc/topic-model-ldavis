         <p>John Swallow has been retired from the government forces
            and pensioned off. HE has been working on the WPA. Moses Decorah says that apparently
            some of the boys from the Indian Mission are taking up aviation. One sees them
            frequently around the “Air-port.” We give to necessity the praise of virtue even after
            she mothered the inventions of warfare to slaughter off the sons of mothers. Good
            defrosters on cars give us the idea that what this country needs is a weatherman with a
            good defroster when winter comes. Of all the words of men and pen none is so forceful
            and far reaching in helping the farmer than the mere phrase of “Use lots o’ butter”.
            Thursday will be another anniversary for the first batch of port sausage-Feb. 2nd,
            ground hog day. Probably gigs will fly their flags half mast. TO close the last two days
            of January, I want to thank everybody for all the kind letters sent in. I got both of
            them. That’s getting up in the world, isn’t it? .</p>
