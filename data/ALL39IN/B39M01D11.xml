Credit committee members are Robert Nortman Clarence Hoke and James Klir Jr The supervisory or auditing committee Otto Flugstad  D W A Holder and Mrs Thomas Stodola In view of the fact that the

in any way with existing loaning agencies but to help members in need of financial assistance on favorable terms to the mutual benefit of all concerned The union is under the supervision of the banking department and has to come up to its rigid requirements Any one interested in the local credit union is invited to make inquiries of any of the directors who will be able to explain the value

Giles Rickard; and Treasurer Mrs Lafe Onstad As usual devotions led by the president preceded the business and secular part of the meeting report was given of several changes that have been made at the parsonage which will aid materially in the comfort of the family rearrangement of walls in the furnace room of stairway leading to the basement of removal of the hot water tank from an upstairs room and connecting directly with the furnace; of new doorway being cut and thus doing away with dangerous trap door to the basement and other minor adjustments All who have called at the parsonage to see the finished job are enthusiastic about it and glad to know it has been done Since the Ladies Aid has sponsored this change it will mean slight increase in few money making activities  motion was

what will be the effect upon the administration’s general course as to legislation In the last Congress the Democrats had 327 members in the House to 90 Republicans In the Senate there were 77 Democrats and 15 Republicans In this Congress the Democrats have 261 members in the House and 69 in the Senate and the Republicans 169 in the House and 23 in the Senate The administration party still has large preponderance of membership in both houses But included on its party rolls are numerous senators and representatives who were elected in the face of strong administrative opposition Until test vote comes upon some administration policy the actual situation may remain undetermined The president’s message was read in person to both houses in joint session Domestic problems were subordinated to the discussion of the foreign situation the dangers of war and the need for greater preparation for national defense if war should come The president was more mild in tone and in the substance of his communication than when he presented his first message to the previous congress No mention was made of mandate” by the people nor was there castigation of those who opposed his program He set forth in few sentences some of the problems which will come up for consideration including the farm problem and that of relief for the unemployed Further discussion of these and other questions will be taken up in the budget message and probably in further messages as the session continues One important change to be noted in the general situation is the new prominence of Vice President Gamer in administration councils Mr Garner had not broken with the White House but in the last Congress it was apparent that he was far from in accord with many of its policies At present the Vice President seems to be the key man and is wielding more powerful influence than probably any vice president has ever exercised Just what may come of this new arrangement will remain to be seen The first important problem which will be taken up by Congress will be that of further appropriations for WPA The present appropriation will last only until March 1st and deficiency bill for the remaining four months of the fiscal year is in the making It is estimated that from 500 to 700 million dollars will be recommended The fight will come not only upon the amount involved but the whole subject will be under debate The policy for the next fiscal year will not be determined until later but it may be affected by what Con gress does with the deficiency measure Before determination is made as to continuing or abolishing WPA it is quite likely that one house or another may authorize committee investigation of the Works Progress Administration activities The report of the special Senate committee upon election practices denouncing the manner in which the WPA was used politically in some states Pennsylvania and Kentucky in particular gives official sanction to attacks which have been so freely made Even some senators who have been charged with using WPA to their own political advantage now are among those who have joined the movement to take WPA out of politics The movement should be and probably will be broadened so as to also take politics out of WPA The forces of the WPA were largely augmented from last July until October when they reached their peak with over 3 000 000 on the rolls Since election reduction of the number of employees has been underway and northern states and municipalities are feeling the effect of that reduction in the added claims for direct relief With three winter months ahead and unemployment at its peak in many centers states more seriously affected are among those which are protesting further reduction at this time In one Wisconsin city one family of every six has been supported from WPA employment or by direct relief The WPA officials have completed survey of the number of young people on farms unable to find employment in their home communities because of the agricultural situation and their report indicates that the unemployment problem is being further complicated by farm distress Over one million young people are leaving farm homes each year to obtain employment in industrial centers while an equal number remaining at home are unable to be profitably engaged Not many of these young farm folks become enrolled in the city WPA rolls but in finding city employment they displace others who do or obtain jobs which might otherwise go to the city unemployed The report is not surprising to those acquainted with rural conditions and who have watched the movement city ward for years When the government comes to recognition of the fact that manv city problems are due to the decline in agriculture it may approach the problem of unemployment from its proper angle Were the million young people now on farms and unable to make things go put in position to do well at home they would not be rushing to the cities for jobs  W HORSE E ETIN S IN JAC SO C U TY Two meetings have been scheduled for B A Beach Professor of Veterinary Science College of Agriculture Madison on Tuesday January

cost of the WPA Had it been increased an equal amount instead of having been decreased Congress might not have such serious WPA problem to deal with Could all farmers fare as well as those on new government project in Arizona things might improve somewhat but restoration of agriculture will have to come from policies rather than projects The government purchased 4 200 acres of irrigated lands and built homes for 60 families together with bams and other sutbuildings The property was turned over to corporation which manages the project Each farmer works for AN  R H STR O TH ERS E ETIN There
