         <p>THE COUNTY FAIR
Next Saturday morning September
9 the Jackson County Fair will
open and continue until Tuesday evening 
September 12 Four full days
that will be crammed full with opportunities
for profitable enjoyment
provided by the Fair management 
For several years this Fair has
been in the ascendancy the Fair of
1938 being considered the biggest
and the best ever held Now it is
confidentally expected that the coming
Fair will exceed the last in the
matter o f number and quality o f exhibits 
the merits o f the special attractions
and in attendance 
Frank Bright as president and
Douglas Curran as secretary have
been devoting a lot o f time to making
plans for the Fair and they have
been ably assisted by Roy Kunzelman 
Vice President and Willard Jones 
Treasurer Behind them in their e fforts
have been the board o f directors
and the county committee A staff
o f young ladies in Douglas Curran s
office has given valuable assistance
and now everything is in readiness 
It is not enough to say that there
will be all o f the sights and attractions
usual to a county fair because
a careful perusal o f the Jackson
County Fair News which has been distributed
thruout all o f the county will
convince every one that much more
has been provided for The Jackson
County Fair officials have an enviable
reputation for making good on
their promises and o f giving more
than expected The Fair this year
will be no exception 
No detailed account o f what can
and will be seen at the Fair can be
attempted in this brief writeup Agan
we refer to The Jackson County Fair
News Remember that Saturday will
be entrance day and that there will
be no night fair Sunday Monday
and Tuesday it will be all day and
ju  t about all night The Fair officials
promise to carry out the published
program in every detail unless
Acts o f Providence prevent 
There always has been a good
showing o f live stock at the Fair and
this year there will be 8 pure bred
bull calves o f the Holstein Guernsey
and Brown Swiss breeds in the stock
barn and all exhibited by 4 H members 
The older exhibitors will also
be there with the best showing they
can produce and they are determined
not to be beaten in quality by the 4 H
exhibits even if they have to take
second place in numbers 
The 20 4 H booths will be under
the grand stand and there will be exhibits
o f farm crops vegetables sewing 
canning and other homemakers
work that will show definitely what
is being done by the 4 H clubs o f the
county The adult Homemakers will
have exhibits o f their skill and that
will be well worth seeing 
Band music will be an outstanding
feature o f the Fair The Black River
Falls school band will play Sunday 
and at 3:30 p m the Winona Municipal
Band will lead the 4 H and open
class parade Both bands will give
concerts later in the day Monday
the Hixton and Alma Center school
bands will play alone and in massed
concert Tuesday the Melrose school
band clad in bright new uniforms 
wil hold the center o f the music
stage 
More should be said for the farm
machinery exhibits the horse pulling
contest the man pulling contests the
special attractions and the midway 
but time and space prevents Howeve 
special reference must be made
to the baseball game between the
Merchants o f Black River Falls and
the Trempealeau County All Stars 
This game will be called at 3 :30 p 
b Another highlight for Monday will
be the big fireworks display at night 
Every one should go to the Fair 
The Castle Mound Park is growing
in popularity as a place for picnics
and as a wayside eating place for
travelers The natural beauty o f the
place as well as the splendid conveniences
provided and the excellent care
that is being taken o f the grounds are
being more fully appreciated as they
become more generally known Naturally
the most o f the picnics are held
in the late afternoon and evening 
and now that the days are becoming
shorter the need for some adequate
system o f electric lighting is becoming
more apparent Lights are needed
in the lodge the caretakers cottage 
at the entrances and around the
picnic grounds The park is a federal
project and in all other respects an
excellent and highly commendable job
has been done greatly for the pleasure
and benefit o f all o f our citizens 
We submit thirt the city o f Black
River Falls should take the initiative
in providing the needed electric lights 
The city utility now gives service almost
to the park entrance

THE ROBERT DOUGLAS
MARKER DEDICATED
Monday September 4th will long
be remembered by the people o f Melrose
and vicinity as a red letter day 
Practically the entire day was given
over to a community picnic the location
and outstanding features o f
which were determined by the dedication
o f the Robert Douglas marker
on the banks o f the Black river
where Mr Douglas landed on April
13 1839 
The event was really a special feature
o f the Black River Valley Centennial 
When it was decided to celebrate
the 100th anniversary o f the
permanent settlement o f the valley a
committee was appointed to procure
suitable markers for several historic
spots one o f which was to be in honor
o f the settlement by Robert Douglas 
D
avid Blencoe president o f the
Jackson County Historical Society 
was named as chairman o f the committee
and three markers have been
secured two marking the sites o f saw
mills at Black River Falls and the
Robert Douglas marker at Melrose 
The Jackson County Board provided
the necessary funds 
The Melrose committee in charge
o f arrangements consisted o f Dr I 
H Lavine Rev L H Holmes Eldon
Helle and John Spaulding Their arrangements
were complete in every
detail and around 400 people assembled
at the site for the dedication 
Harold E Wike o f Sparta long connected
with the Melrose school was
master o f ceremonies 
A truck with chairs was occupied
by Arthur E Douglas Melrose son
of Robert; Mrs B E Nelson o f La
Crosse granddaughter   Mrs Oliver
M Gnewikow Mindoro granddaughter;
Mrs Guilford Willey La Crosse 
grand niece; and A D Polleys o f
Melrose all o f whom were introduced
by Mr Wike 
After a concert by the Melrose
school band Mr Wike introduced
Olaus Overlien who with brief but
witty and complimentary remarks 
presented Fred R Zimmerman Secretary
o f State main speaker o f the
day Mr Zimmerman in the course
o f his address paid several merited
compliments to our highway commissioner 
In the course o f his dedicatory address
Mr Zimmerman spoke eloquently
and with much feeling yet in language
all of his hearers could understand 
He contrasted the personal
freedom and religious liberty enjoyed
in the country founded and developed
by pioneers o f the Robert Douglas
type with those o f many other countries 
He referred to the almost impregnable
barriers separating countries
o f the old world with the inconspicuous
roadside markers which are
the only means a traveler can tell
He is survived by his wife Bertha 
o f Humbird; three sons Alton and
Elgin o f Eau Claire and Burton 
o f Wausau; two sisters Mrs F A 
Shute o f Altoona Mrs A S Huyck
o f Duluth; three brothers Edward 
o f Madison Frank o f Lvnden Wash 
Henry o f Humbird and three grandchildren 
Mr Staliard was well known and
highly regarded by the many who
knew him in this city and the deep
sympathy o f all goes out to his widow
and children and other relatives in
their sorrow 
Last week the T C Esser Co of
La Crosse installed the glass work
on the front o f the Millis recreational
building now nearing completion The
front is unique in that the large plate
glass windows are eight cornered  irregular
octagon  in shape instead o f
the usual square or rectangular The
windows are set about three feet
apart and somewhat higher than with
ordinary store fronts The brick wall
around the windows from sidewalk to
cornice is covered with a dark mottled
blue heavy glass with horizontal
stripes o f cream glass Above the
entrance there is   Millis  in script 
and above the windows   Recreation 
in plain letters These letters are also
o f glass a light buff set into the
blue The front presents an attractive
as well as an unusual appearance
and   Jake  and   Ray  are receiving
many compliments because of its
beauty and attractiveness We hope
to have a picture o f the front to publish
with a more detailed description
o f the building is completed and
ready for the opening 
Hillard Anderson recently took
over the management o f the Cities
Service Station on Water street I potatoes cows sheep pigs and hens
which was managed by Paul Ginther ! *n the Valley

       f or parking cars and for the ball
ground and to the committee that
policed the pasture and provided the
conveniences which were much appreciated
by all 
The faculty members o f the Melrose
high and grade schools were introduced
and there was more band
music A D Polleys who has gained
an enviable reputation as the historian
o f the lower Black river valley
was the last speaker and his talk
covered the experiences o f Robert
Douglas for the first few years following
his location 
A fter the dedication ceremonies
were concluded there was a big picnic
dinner in the nearby grove The
Melrose Shake Hollow and Red
School Homemakers had charge o f the
dinner service The Athena Club the
Rebekkah Lodge and the Royal
Neighbors all took an active part in
the big day s activities In the afternoon
there was a tug of war ball
games and other sports for the men 
The marker consists o f a bronze
plaque appropriately inscribed and
attached to a granite boulder taken
from the bed o f the Black river and
set in a square concrete base Nearby
are placards showing the exact site o f
the first cabin and the first well 
To one reared in an atmosphere
o f reverence and veneration for all
men and women who braved the perils
and endured the hardships necessary
to open up and develop a new
country anywhere the placing and
dedication o f the Robert Douglas
marker was a fitting and a proper
tribute to the first actual settler in
the Black River Valley

PAUL JONES SPENDS
SUMMER IN EAST
Paul Jones is spending a couple o f
weeks at the home o f his parerrts Mr 
and Mrs A P Jones He returned
Monday after a sojourn o f two
months spent in and about New York
City Arriving in the east he enrolled
at New York University studying
advanced choral methods and conducting
under Hugh Ross internationally
known director o f the Schola
Cantorum This was followed by
three weeks o f study at Mt Hermon 
Massachusetts with Dr John Finley
Williamson founder and director of
Westminster Choir College Princeton 
New Jersey and with whom Mr 
Jones had studied on two previous
occasions Following a visit with
friends in northern Vermont Paul returned
to Hempstead Long Island 
for several days o f sight seeing at the
nearby New York W orld s Fair His
return trip was through New Jersey 
Pennsylvania and New York to Niagara
Falls then through Canada to
Detroit Chicago and home 
Among the many interesting sidelights
o f his vacation the most thrilling
was a 45 minute ride over New
York City down the bay to the Statue
o f Liberty and return over the
New Jersey shore in a Goodyear
blimp The glass enclosed cabin carried
five passengers and the pilot 
and the airship traveled at a speed of
between 40 to 50 miles an hour the
height above the city varying between
two and three thousand feet The
slower speed and more sustained
flight have an advantage over airplane
travel in offering greater time
for careful observation One o f Mr 
Jones fellow passengers was a New
Jersey police officer w ho took pictures
o f points o f traffic congestion
along the western shore o f the Hudson 
T
here was also a half day s fishing
in the Atlantic ocean five miles off
the Long Island shore The captain
o f the 50 passenger fishing tug knew
exactly where the fish were biting at
various times during the afternoon 
and as a result every one on board
had about all he could do hauling in
fish The porgies and flounder which
were taken average about 20 inches
in length but do not have the proportionate
weight to fresh water fish 
Mr Jones and his companion caught
about 30 pounds o f fish which made
quite a bulge in a gunny sack The
porgy tackle consisted o f two hooks
about ten inches apart baited with
bits o f squid and it was nothing extraordinary
to haul in two fish at a
time 
The summer also included concerts
by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra 
the N B C orchestra and
the Boston Symphony which was
heard at the Berkshire Festival Lenox 
Mass plays by summer stock
companies in the barn theatres of
Vermont and New Hampshire an inspection
trip o f modem pipe organ installations
in and around Boston motor
trips through the Adirondack
mountains o f northern New York and
the Green mountains o f Vermont and
with the various special art exhibits
attendant to the W orld s Fair thrown
in for good measure ***

GIANT COLLEGIANS
19TH MERCHANTS VICTIM
The skeptical who can t seem to
get the idea that a traveling ball team
can be beaten by a semi pro team got
another dose o f what goes to make
the skeptics look like a cat which has
just been caught eating the canary 
Last Sunday night for the second
time this season the Merchants plastered
a licking on the Giant Collegians
o f Piney Woods Mississippi this
time t 4 to 1 to prove to the rational
that the Merchants are a better
ball team than most o f the itinerant
organizations The colored men were
out for blood Sunday night and they
told Rudy so The result o f this information
to Ernie was that he gave
them only two scoring chances the
second o f which burned up when Rudolph
struck out Hayes clean up hitter
and Popeye in the next spot The
colored boys weren t fooling but Rudolph
wasn t fooling either 
In order to get properly fortified
for the Giant s Manager Rudolph imported
Don Wright a swatsman of
no mea nability who hails from White
hall Don vindicated Ernie s judgment
by smashing the pill to the
fence twice once being batted back
in the playing field just as it was going
over Wright s first drive was a
prodigious effort that traveled about
375 feet to the fence in center His
other distance swat in the 8th with
Slugger Rudolph on second was sailing
over the snow fence in right when
Popeye slapped it back into the playing
field It was about as lusty a
demonstration o f power hitting as
ball fans have had the chance to see
this season Don not only looks like
Babe Ruth but the amiable restaurant
man powders the pill in much the
same way 
But despite the thrills which Wright
gave the folks it was Arthur Mr 
Rudolph s boy who clouted out the
hit which won the ball game for the
boys In fact the chubby rascal had
a hand in three o f the four tallies
registered by the home club Art
erased any doubt as to who would
win when he planted a hit in right
to score Randles and Kleven to put
the Locals ahead 2 to 1 in the first 
After being stranded following his hit
in the fifth he came up with his third
safety o f the game in the 8th to set
up the 4th Falls run which was given
a ride around on Wright s 2 bagger
to left 
Ernie kept his earned run average
down to exactly one tally per game
by allowing Williams the first Giant
batter to get around in lieu o f a walk
to Atterberry just before Tyler drove
a hot ground ball over second Will
iams scored on the Giant third sack
er s bingle to close the enemy attack
for the night Just to be sure the
Black men weren t going to get rambunctious
Rudy struck out 17 o f em 
The little fireballer permitted only
seven hits and issued only a solitary
pass Only three o f the visiting hits
were good solid wallops which is
pretty feeble work for a team which
some people think can score a dozen
runs whensoever the whim might
strike them It might be well to re
member in this connection that The
Brown Cubs took a 20 to 0 victory
from another o f the stronger county
teams 
The Merchant scoring briefly adds
up as follows: after Randles who
had been passed and Kleven who got
hit in the pants had been pushed to
third and second respectively on
Teeples neat sacrifice Art Rudolph
slapped his two run single to right 
This happened in the first Wright
beat out a hit to third in the 7th and
moved up on a free ticket to Hauser 
Both boys were nudged along another
notch on Randles pass Wright
counted as Ward was being retired
on a ground ball to short by Kleven 
Art was forced by Ernie following
the former s hit in the 8th Wright
aimed at the fence in left but didn t
leave enough margin for clearance so
got only two bags because Popeye got
his mit in front o f the ball before it
got over the fence Ernie concluded

STEPHANS AND DAVIDITES
PUT ON SHOW WIN 3 TO 2
Miss Helen Stephans and her House
of Davidites put on their big show
before a fine crowd at the Fair
grounds Sunday Aug 27th and went
away none the worse for their experience
here The Davidites eased out a
skimy 3 to 2 win over the Merchants
and none o f the many laurels Miss
Stephans holds were taken away from
her An intermission was declared in
the 7th for the girl to put on her
show She started out by slinging an
8 pound shot around like it was a
buckshot and then was matched in a
foot race over a 100 yard stretch with
Bob Teeples which was won by the
young lady We got statements from
the entries which were viz:
Mises Stephans    What was your
speed Merchant hitched to a fance
post  
Mister Teeples:   I wuz robbed! 
Our opinion is still that both them
folks can skim over the landscape
with plenty o f the old zip Anyway
lots o f people know now what an
Olympic champion looks like that s
something 
Contrary to their custom the Merchants
did not live up to their policy
o f playing their best ball against the
toughest competition in the game
with the bewhiskered Davidites and
a pair o f sleezy plays allowed the itinerant
visitors to capture a win on
what are referred to as   breaks  
The first o f these came on an ortwo
runs when at least three should
have cleared up a situation but resulted
in a pair o f bearded runs Another
break came in the sixth when a
booming Black River rally was nipped
in the bud by base stealing difficulties 
In this chapter three doubles
and a single were coined into only
two runs when a tleast three should
have been in That s baseball though
and you can t get away from breaks 
Rudy pitched swell ball all the way
through the ball game allowing only
four solid hits and scattering those 
beside striking out ten whiskers and
issuing only a single pass The Merchants
on the other hand bunched
their hits well which is what a winning
ball team should do but it wasn t
in the cards and so the victory wore
a beard 
The first hit o f the ball game
came in the third and was a slow
roller along the base line which Ernie
handled Kramer who authored the
hit moved to second on a sacrifice
by Brooks Then Bloomer hit a fly
to right but it got away for an error
and Kramer scored while Bloomer
raced to third A legitimate hit to
center by Sass sent the hirsute second
sacker home with the second run of
the frame 
A third count was registered by the
Davidites in the fifth on an Alphonse
and Gaston infield hit inside the first
base line which was counted as a hit
because no one was on first to make
a put out A fter Amato had been
retired on strikes Smith drilled a
hit to right and Sass went to third
and scored from here while Smith
was being forced at second on Beck s
grounder to E Rudolph 
The Falls guns started booming in
a big way in the last o f the sixth
and two runs resulted Kleven opened
the round with a line double to
left center and was promptly shooshed
home when Teeples dynamited a
double to the same hunk o f geography 
Art bashed a hit past first and
Teeples took third Teeples raced
home on a squeeze play Ernie getting
credit for a sacrifice on his bunt and
also getting credit for a run driven
in Art moved to second on the play 
The keystone combination didn t pay
much attenion to the slugger on second
so he decided to go to third 
While Art s judgment on base running
was okey the younger Rudolph
didn t reckon with what an umpire
might see or fail to see so after Art
had slid into third and was later
touched with the ball he was ordered
off the base lines as being nothing
more than a carcass Hoard s double
along the third base line would have
tied the score if Art had been a live
base runner Hauser ended the inning
by slapping a bounder to Brooks 
That is the sum o f the profitable
Merchant attack hits by Shaw in the
7th and A Rudolph being wasted 
Thursday night o f this week the
Merchants will cross war clubs with
the powerful Giant Collegians first
string ball team o f the Piney Woods
Mississippi Colored school It will be
recalled that earlier in the season
these two ball clubs battled ten innings
before Black River was returned
a 4 to 3 victor and a great crowd
was limp from the excitement o f the
greatest ball game o f the year There
is probably greater rivalry between
the Giants and the Merchants than
between any traveling and local team
in the country It has been rumored
that even some o f the Black River
Falls business men will be out to see
this battle and if it doesn t rain there
will be a packed house o f baseball
fans from all over this area to see
those blacks and whites display their
skill 
We have had a number o f cards
and oral inquiries as to the Merchant
record for the year so will set it
forth here Games won 17 games
lost 5 games tied 1

VILLAGE   DADS  PONDER
DAM PROPOSITION
The members o f the Village Board
have been considering very deeply
the past few weeks on the matter
o f putting in a new dam and water
wheel down at the power house One
proposition after another has come
up one engineer after another has
been consulted and to date no decision
has been made 
The matter o f finance comes into
the proposition very much and statements
have been reported that there
have been bids received up to about
$35 000 This is a large sum o f money
to put the village under obligation
and therefore the Board ponders
about the matter It is also reported
that the engineers consulted have different
ideas about the matter
and the one that can seld his
Idea about a dam gets the larger
commission o f course 
There is not much question that a
new dam is badly needed A new and
later type o f water wheel would be
a valuable addition to the plant An
umbrella type o f wheel is mostly considered 
as the connection now in use
loses much power in getting it to the
dynamo It is also stated that the
power line to the village is badly
needed and a re location is considered 
The power line about the village
is also in need o f re building and
perhaps a redistribution o f takers
along the line is considered Radio
users report much disturbance o f local
static 
So all in all no wonder the Board
ponders It s a mighty question for
the village and they want to do the
right thing and at the same time
not put the village too badly in debt 
The Board consists o f Mayor Hendrix 
Dahlstrom Heise Anger Gile 
Rush and Helbling 
There is another way o f solving the
problem and that is selling the whole
outfit to the Northern States or connect
up with the R E A

he proud! We wish every one could
have seen him Believe it or not

MERLIN HULL S LETTER
There will be a special session o f
Congress should war continue in
Europe according to Washington announcements 
In the waiting period
there seems to be no little activity
in planning the program for such
a session even though all sensible
people the world over are praying
that Europe shall not destroy itself
in another conflict Some o f the prop
osa l which have been dear to the
hearts o f those who want war time
regimentation provided by law in advance
o f our having a war probably
will be brushed off and polished up 
all ready for Congress The president
probably will base his call upon
his demand for repeal o f the embargo
upon arms shipments to warring
countries but that will be only a
small part o f the grand scheme o f
things toward our preparations m
case war comes to America 
Under the neutrality law as it
stands as soon as war is declared
between countries all shipments of
arms and munitions to any country
so engaged must stop immediately 
If the embargo provision is repealed 
it is proposed to vest power in the
president to determine what countries
may buy such war materials
here and what nations may not Or 
even that provision may not be asked
for and all nations be permitted to
supply themselves from our resources
for their attempt at world destruction 
      
Great Britain and France would be
highly favored by repeal o f the embargo
act Their command o f the
seas in time o f war is conceded They
could and would obtain all the war
materials they needed and could pay
for Other countries would be unable
to obtain anything for war or
even for food or other purposes because
they could not get it across the
Atlantic If the repeal is effected 
our country as in 1914 15 and 16 
would become the great source o f
materials with which the war would
be carried on Our war profiteers
would have a very busy and profitable
time as they did in the World
war 
Great Britain and Prance have been
piling their money reserves in banking
centers here in anticipation o f
trouble It is estimated that the two
countries have not less than four
billions o f dollars in our banks ready
to pay for all orders Without repeal
of the embargo act they would
be able to purchase food supplies and
all else except the commodities used
only for war purposes Under the act
as it stands they could continue to
buy cotton copper steel and other
materials for war needs in unmanufactured
form just as Japan has been
doing so extensively in order to make
successful its war grab in China 
Four billion dollars and another
even greater amount which the two
countries could realize by selling the
securities in corporations held by
their citizens in this country would
not last long with war expenses running
into millions daily But countries
would soon be wanting purchases
on credit just as they did in
the World war to the great detriment
of our national treasury and national
debt 
There is another law which will be
the center o f attack if a special session
is called along with the embargo
act and that is the Johnson law It
forbids any country which owes us
World war debts obtaining any
credit in our country by sales o f its
bonds or other securities This law
would prevent any o f the debtor
countries doing much business here 
as they have taxed their credit pretty
strongly at home by their war preparations 
It is not an air tight law
as it is but if the embargo act is
repealed it would fairly serve its purpose 
It was reported last year that
Italy which owes us billions had in
a round about way known to the international
banking crowd obtained
$125 000 000 every dollar o f which
went into preparation for the present
crisis It was reported also that Germany 
which owes us several hundred
millions also obtained $70 000 000 
possibly part o f which went to pay
for the materials including engines
for its new great air fleet 
Whether or not reports o f such
added loans are authentic American
money continued to flow into Europe
by some means until the time o f the
Munich conference last September 
notwithstanding the Johnson law The
World war debts due us from the
nations now threatening another war
among themselves amount to more
than thirteen billions With interest
added the amount ig five or six
billions more In all we are out nearly
half the amount o f our national
debt about whir h many folks are
concerned due to the credits extended
to European nations on account of
the World war I f another war
comes repeal o f the Johnson act will
add still more to our foreign loans
and also to our national debt 
Among other measures which will
be brought up will be the so called
  general mobilization  bill which in
one form or another has been before
Congress for many years It is a
plan for placing under government
control practically every resource if
not every citizen in case our country
should blunder into another war It
is general in terms and quite ambiguous
as to its scope and the field
it would cover Also it as yet has
not been so drawn as to define the
size o f a war we should have to engage
in order that the powers o f the
bill would become operative Nor has
it exactly defined what if any constitutional
rights o f American citizens
would be left to them once the general
mobilization plans were ordered
into force and effect Certainly the
orders would be no milder than those
o f the World war which many people
still remember 
The president states that a survey
o f our resources will be made at once
to determine what could and  should
be done and also steps will be taken
to plan protection to our industries
and business generally should a
European conflict upset economic
conditions seriously to their detriment 
The taking o f the 1940 census
is coming on at a time when it will
be possible to make note o f what our
resources may be in industrial and
military man power without great expense 
Special efforts have been made by
the county fair board to improve
sleeping conditions for the boys who
might remain at the Fair grounds to
care for their livestock All boys will
find space in the new sleeping quarters
built in the dairy barn Permanent
structures have been built
with solid floors and sides It will
not be necessary for the boys to sleep
in the different barns and stalls The
boys will find facilities for washing
and spaces for permanent bunks 
Soil Con*ervation District Party
Better than 175 farm folks attended
the meeting and get together party
at the York Community hall last
Friday evening O R Zeasman College
o f Agriculture talked on soil
conservation and discussed in detail
the different methods which farmers
may use to keep the soil on their
farms Film strips were shown to
illustrate the different conservation
practices which have been used by
different farmers and conservation
camps 
James Deringer newly appointed
conservationist who is in charge of
the district gave a short talk on accomplishments
in the district to date 
He introduced the other two men who
have been assigned to the district including
Howard Gutgesell formerly
o f Camp Irving who has also been
assigned to the district in the capacity
o f an assistant conservationist 
also Earl Ryan engineer for the district 
Since Mr Deringer was unable
to find a house at Northfield or York
he found it necessary to rent a house
at Pigeon Falls 
Progress in the district has been
quite satisfactory since 35 farmers
have filed applications requesting
that complete plans be made for their
farms Since this is a voluntary program
any farmer in the district may
file an application for this work 
Last week a very fine line o f playground
equipment was installed along
the south end o f the city school
grounds There are a number of
shade trees there and it is close to
the grade school building and the
most convenient for the little tots
who will get so much enjoyment and
needed exercise out o f it Perhaps
the most popular piece will be the
merry go round on which more than
forty o f the children can ride at one
time and no other power than the little
legs will be needed to make it go
round at a lively rate Then there is
the big slide a unit o f six swings for
the larger children and another unit
o f three smaller swings with chair
seats for the little ones There are
the two old teeters which have seen
much service but the others are new 
All o f the pieces are strongly made
and of durable construction and great
care was taken in their installation 
It is one o f the best and most commendable
o f the many good jobs that
have been done on the school grounds 
It will be a popular play ground for
the children not only when school is
in session but throughout all o f the
summer months a fact which makes
its installation the more commendable 
There is an orange tree growing on
the south porch of the A P Jones
residence on which there are 12
oranges from the size o f a hazel nut
to a fair sized orange now turning
yellow The tree is really a product
of the fostering care o f Miss Gertrude
Wagner o f the high school faculty 
who started it several years ago It
is a real orange tree and an interesting
sight for one who has never seen
an orange grove Look for it when
you attend the Jackson County Fair 
More than 20 o f the members of
the Black River Falls Class o f 1937
had a weiner roast at Hatfield Wednesday
night Harold Gilbertson Mildred
Christianson and Totty Bowman
were in charge o f arrangements and
the fine turnout resulted in a most
pleasureable reunion for all Why
doesn t some other class try having
such a picnic too 
Applications for marriage license
Saturday at the County Clerk s office
were Miss Cleo Patry o f Melrose 
daughter o f Clyde F Patry and Arthur
L Loomis son o f Jacob Loomis 
La Crosse; also Miss Maxine Tucker 
daughter o f Mrs Gladys Tucker and
Mont Claire Horswill son o f Merlin
Horswill both o f this city 
Mrs Chris Capaul has returned
after a two weeks visit at the home
o f Mrs R B Jackson and daughter
Fern at Martford Michigan She
also visited a few days with her
nephew James Mulady at Cass City 
Mich She reports the fruit crop is
very good Mrs Capaul had a very
lovely time while away 
Miss Bessie Livingstone left Saturday 
returning to Glendive Mont to
resume her teaching duties Miss
Livingstone reports having had the
most interesting and enjoyable vacation
o f her life made so by her European
tour and her visit with relatives
and friends in the old home
town 
Mrs O G Rahn was an honored
guest at a party given at the home
o f Mrs Chas Wilcox Friday evening 
by members o f the Altoona Woman s
club Mrs Rahn who leaves soon to
make her home in Black River Falls 
was presented an etching by the club 
  Eau Claire Leader and Telegram
Mr and Mrs J C Tollack and son
Howard went to the Tollack Overlien
cottage at Star Lake last Thursday 
On fS iday they were joined by their
daughter Miss Margaret and Frank
Clarke o f Madison All left for their
homes Tuesday morning after an enjoyable
and restful experience at the
lake 
F J Bowman closed a deal Tuesday 
whereby Mrs Anna Hoffman became
the owner o f the residence owned
by Mrs Oscar Christenson northeast
o f the high school building It
is a six room residence nicely located 
Mrs Hoffman is planning improvements
to be made in the near
future 
Under the call for a special session 
the action o f congress would be limited
to the specific problems for which
it would be called but the terms are
usually broad enough to make considerable
other legislation possible It is
to be hoped that the crisis abroad
soon will pass on and that no war
session shall be demanded Undoubtedly
our country would be affected
by another great war but the principal
concern o f congress if called
into session should be to make sure
that we are not drawn into it and
that neither our men our money nor
our other resources shall be poured
into it We have plenty o f problems
o f our own which need all that
congress can do to solve them

RURAL MAILBOX IMPROVEMENT
W EEK BEGINS SEPT 10TH
The post office department is again
this year sponsoring a rural mail box
improvement week beginning Sept 
10th and the Jackson County Postal
Employees Association appeals to all
the rural patrons o f the county asking
that they give special attention to
the campaign which is being promoted
for that week 
A great deal was accomplished during
the rural mail box improvement
week a year ago and we trust that
the rural patrons will cooperate with
us again this year in an effort that
will make this campaign a greater
success 
It is the desire o f the Post Office
Department to encourage patrons o f
the rural delivery service to provide
suitable receptacles and to erect them
in such manner that will be accessible
to the carrier and present a neat appearance 
Unsightly rural mail boxes detract
from the natural scenic beauty along
highways and are not a credit to the
owners o f attractive homes served
through the boxes 
Articles will appear in the next
two issues o f this paper pertaining to
mail box improvement week and if
any o f the rural patrons have any
questions pertaining to this campaign
we ask that they contact one o f the
following: their postmaster rural
carrier or any postal employee Your
cooperation in this campaign will be
appreciated

LAKE ARBUTUS W ATER LEVEL 
TO BE ESTABLISHED
An organization is being formed to
establish a permanent lake level for
Lake Arbutus at Hatfield on the
Black river This lake as you know 
was drained completely this summer
to the detriment o f fish life and quatic
vegetation Undoubtedly record
fish have been either destroyed or
have gone on down Black river to
places inaccessible to fishermen o f
this section The area has also been
destroyed as a beauty spot and outdoor
recreational area This organization
is being formed to bring about
rulings o f the Department o f Conservation
and the Public Service Commission
to prevent any furteher destruction
and draining by the Power
Co operating the dam at Hatfield 
The purpose o f the organization is
to build up Black River Lake Arbutus
area as a fishing and recreational region 
This can be done by:
1 Obtaining a lake level for protection
o f spawn and all aquatic life 
2 Having a strong local organization
to obtain seining o f lake when
needed and the planting o f new fish
life 
In order to have a level determined 
an application must be made to Public
Service Commission and presenting
facts pictures and figures to substantiate
our petition 
All 1940 dues are to be used in
working out conditions above 
We have been promised by the
Conservation Commission that above
area will receive their attention as to
planting and seining as soon as we
have a definite level 
Work is being done at present and
your dues o f fifty cents for 1940 will
help put this project over

COMMITTEE
It is generally understood that the
draining o f this lake was necessary
to make needed repairs on the dam
which created the lake That many
fine fish were destroyed is evidenced
by the number o f dead ones coming
down the Black river This is very
much to be regretted and should if
possible be avoided in the future 
  Yon look all in today BilL What s
the trouble  
  Well I didn t get home until after
daylight and I was just undressing
when my wife woke up and said
 Aren t you getting up pretty early  
In order to save an argument I put
on my clothes and came down to the
office     Exchange

for the rent o f this sumptuous apartment

Minneapolis Minn 
Treasurer  Alfred Johnson o f

H Stahl o f Jackson Minn 
These and the members o f the Synod
held a conference on Friday and
Saturday Sept 1 and 2 and on Sunday

o f their founder in the form o f a
Centennial Commemoration 
Elling Eielsen (Sunve) was born
in Voss Norway on Sept 19 1804 
He learned the carpenters trade and
affiliated with the teachings o f Hans
Nilson Hauge in the Lutheran faith 
For seven years he traveled the
length and breadth o f Norway as a
lay preacher In 1839 he left for
America and on September 3rd landed
in New York City 
He immediately contacted the Norwegians
and continued his Christian
lay work later going to Chicago and
on Sept 17th the same year was
again expounding his teachings 
On July 3rd 1843 he was married
to Sikrid N Tufte On October 3rd 
he was officially ordained as a minister 
being the first ordained Norwegian
Lutheran Minister in America 
It is with this date that the Norwegian
Lutheran Church o f America is
planning its Centennial four years
hence 
On April 13th 1846 Rev Elling
Eielsen organized the first congregation
and the first Norwegian Lutheran
Synod namely The Evangelical
Lutheran Church o f America Eielsen s
Synod This took place at Jefferson
Prairie Wis Rev Eielsen was
elected its President and remained in
this capacity until his death January
10th 1883 He died in Chicago and
was buried there January 14 1883 
Prof O M Norlie states that not
less than 36 different branches o f
church work and activities credits
Rev Elling Eielsen as being the originator 
organizer or rather being first 
For instance:
He built the first church perhaps
in October 1839 
He organized the first congregation 
He organized the first Synod (N orwegian
Lutheran in America)
He gave the first book distributed
by the Northmen in America 
He gave the first book in English 
He gave the first book in Norwegian
and so on 
Prof Norlie described him as a pioneer 
a soldier and trailblazer in the
cause o f God He further states 
Among the 3000 Norwegian Lutheran
ministers in America since 1843
Rev Elling Eielson not only was the
first but is the greatest There may
be a difference o f opinion on the latter
but the form er should be undisputed  
(Lutheraneren Aug 30th 
1939) 
The Evangelical Lutheran Church
o f America being the original Synod 
and incidently the smallest Lutheran
Synod amongst the Norwegians
with less than 20 congregations
in the Northwest They maintain a
Mission home in Carter Wis and
maintain a church publication called
  The Christian Layman  with John
Blannes as editor o f South Haven 
Minn
