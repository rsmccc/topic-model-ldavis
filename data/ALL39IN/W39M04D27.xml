SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN, THURS DAY, APRIL 27,1939 NUMBER 24
Budget Worries
Knottiest, and most tilin g job
tackled by the 133 members of the
two houses of the Wisconsin legislature
at their biennial sessions is the
state budget bill. The budget bill contains
dozens of pages, all of them
closely printed and packed with appropriation
figures for the scores of
state departments, institutions, and
aids to localities for education, charities,
highways and other purposes.
For new members it is a forbidding
job to read through the bill and understand
it clearly at the first reading.
This week when legislators returned
to their desks they found the neatly
printed and bound copies of the
measure before them, calling for an
expenditure of $68,509,000 in its preliminary
draft.
Debate on the appropriations ir. the
bill will consume at least a month, according
to present indications, because
of the stacks of amendments which individual
members have already prepared,
and because of imminent fights
ow r reductions in some expenditures
upon which the Heil administration
forces will insist.
However, there were reliable reports
this week that the administration
would accede to some amendments to
the bill as it emerged from the administration
controlled finance committee.
One of the reasons is the strong objection
made by the teachers’ college
faculties, the college communities, and
their legislative representatives to the
heavy cut proposed for those institutions,
cuts which would necessitate
salary reductions for their teachers
and employes.
Comparisons
Progressives have announced that
they will sponsor amendments calling
for additional appropriations of $6,-
000,000, w'hich if adopted would send
expenditures to higher levels than
ever before in state history.
Neutral observers conceded that the
$68,509,000 figure contained in thc first
draft of the budget will be exceeded
by the legislature; one of the main
reasons is the fact that the bill aswritten
does not include a provision
for relief, which administration legislative
floorleaders admit will be necessary.
Estimates on the final tit a l of
expenditures for the administration
for its two year term this week ranged
from $71,000,000 to $75,000,000.
The reason for the volume of expenditures
proposed, administration men
explain, is the phenomenal growth in
public welfare costs in recent years.
Although the Heil administration has
proposed drastic cuts in several places,
the increases in public welfare expenses
just about balance the economies.
Two Big Jobs
The legislature finished action on
two big jobs last week. It passed and
sent to the governor the Wisconsin
County Boards Association’s bill for
« n increase of $2,700,000 in state
highway aids to counties and localities.
Governor Heil promptly signed it into
law. A few hours afterward, the state
senate followed the lead of the assembly
in passing the bitterly fought Wisconsin
Council of Agriculture’s “employment
peace act,” which replaces
the “ little Wagner” labor law passed
by tbe Progressive-controlled legislature
two years ago.
The new labor law will be one of the
most important enactments of the
1939 legislature, is warmly supported
by Republican leaders and officers of
the big Council of Agriculture, and is
warmly attacked and fought by organized
labor leaders who have announced
that it will be promptly
contested in the courts on the ground
of unconstitutionality.
After four hours of sultry debate
which climaxed many earlier hours of
argument in previous meetings since
February 2, the senate by a vote of
22 to 11 sent the measure to Governor
Heil for his signature. One Progressive,
Joseph McDermid, of Ladysmith,
voted with the Republican-Democratic
majority, while one Republican, Bernard
Gettelman, of Milwaukee, joined
the Progressives in arguing against it
on the final roll calls.
The measure which has provoked
more fancy adjectives, and more bitter
wrangling in the legislature than any
other this session, will limit considerably
picketing and striking activities
of labor organizations, who denounce
it as “repressive” and “fascistic.”
Supporters praise it as a means of
guaranteeing industrial peace, and of
ending “ lab>r racketeering.”
The law would require a 75 per cent
vote of a union for a closed shop, and
would ban minority strikes or picketing.
It would ban secondary boycot-

Capper* Store Is in the
Butler Federated Svstem
I I . R. Cappel, the local merchant,
has become a member of the Butler
Federated Stores system so as to get
the benefit of large-scale buying jointly
by thousands of units and the other
advantages offered by the system
which has been in operation for many
years under the auspices of Butler
Bros., the well-known Chicago wholesalers.
In preparation for the new system,
extensive changes have been made in
the shelving and display facilities in
the large dry goods department of the
store. A couple of representatives of
the Butler company are at present
assisting Mr. Cappel in arranging the
stock according to the newest methods
in merchandising.
Mr. Cappel intends to increase his
stock in the men’s clothing and shoe
lines and cut down in certain other
lines of the dry goods department.
The grand opening under the new
system will be featured with a sale
commencing Saturday, April 29.
New Secretary for Rosholt Fair
Dr. W. A. Jensen, of Rosholt, succeeds
Lester Peterson, also of Rosholt,
as secretary of the Rosholt Fair association.
Peterson served in that
position for many years, and was
elected vice president at a recent
meeting of the directors succeeding
Stanley Kubisiak. Alvin Mathison
was re-elected president, and J. H.
Hanson, treasurer. Harold Anderson
and the officers are directors.
Heretofore, the secretary performed
most of the official duties but these
will be divided between the four
officers. The 1939 fair will be held
September 2, 3 and 4.

Synopsis of Operetta,
Melinka of Astrakhan,
at Gym, Friday Night
Fort Astrakhan is placed in command
of M linka, daughter of General
Ivanoff. following a wager with her
father that women can manage and
defend the fort as well as men. If
she succeeds she is to receive a trip
to America; but if she fails, she must
marry Captain Michael. With a thrill
of adventure Melinka accepts command
with Dean Campbell, Vaska and
Waska, and a group of soldierettes
and American girls to help make the
venture a success.
General Ivanoff supposedly leaves
for Moscow with Sophia, the aviatrix.
however, they steal back in disguise
to observe the outcome. Then things
begin to happen.
Corporal Ivan is also in love with
Melinka but is spurned by her and
reprimanded by his rival, Captain
Michael. Gordon King, a salesman
from the United States, appears at
the fort and presses his attention.
Bobo, a radical Bolshevik, wants to
destroy everything and almost succeeds.
Complications arise when Mary
Strongfort, sister of Gordon, wanders
into the fort lookin for a new novel,
and is persuaded by Corporal Ivan to
put on his uniform and take his place.
A report about spies reaches Melinka
and Dean Campbell, therefore Mary
and two other salesmen, A. B. Cohen
and Chin Chin, are immediately suspected.
Gordon is horrified when he finds
his sister in disguise. Bobo is determined
to blow up the fort. Ivan
shirks his duties and gives him aid.
Mary*is having a great time securing
ideas w h e n ----- Crash! The climax
comes. She is apprehended as a spy
and thrown into the prison tower.
Bobo blunders and gets himself in
the tower as Mary makes her escape.
Melinka suspects Gordon has aided
the prisoner in some way and orders
him to go. He cannot clear himself
because of Mary’s entanglements.
She is still dodging about the fort.
However, in the final scene Gordon
reveals his sister and shows how they
captured the real enemy.
Melinka has won the wager, but
the Captain asks Sophia to marry him,
and she accepts. This causes a landslide
of proposals and acceptances.
Corporal Ivan and Mary, Gordon and
Melinka, and also General Ivanoff and
Dean Campbell. The two salesmen,
A. B. Cohen and Chin Chin, do not
secure an order, but they gain valuable
experience and create a lot of
humor.

Enjoyable Social Event
Well over one hundred people were
present at the Father and Sons banquet
at First Lutheran church parlors
last evening and enjoyed a fine program
of speeches and songs sponsored
by the Lutheran Brotherhood of that
church.
Also appreciated by all was the
fine spread on the banquet tables prepared
and served by the Ladies’ Aid!
Society of the church.
The Rev. Palmer Wahl, pastor of
the congregation, acted as the evening's
toastmaster in the absence of
the Rev. Carl Musall, of Birnamwood,
scheduled to serve in this capacity
but unable to come at the last moment.
The chief speaker of the evening
was Leonard Haas, of Wausau. He
gave a very food talk which was in spirational
and appropriate for the
occasion.
Printed programs distributed to all
present contained the songs of the
evening’s program and these were
sung with a gusto by the assemblage,
with Edwin Born as song leader and
Mr. Lokensgard at the piano.
The Rev. H. M. Mason gave a short
talk in tribute to the sons, which was
neatly responded to by Donald Iverson
in tribute to the fathers.
Speakers called upon by the toast-'
master were Will Gates, O. B. Hagen,
Arthur larson, on behalf of the Lutheran
Brotherhood, Earl Cowles and R.
L. Lokensgard, manager of Homme
Orphan Home, all of whom responded
with befitting remarks.
The banqueteers were also favored
with three vocal solos, Gerhard Johnson
singing. “Open the Gates of the
Temple,” W’alter Kersten singing, “ A
Little Bit of Heaven,” and Russell
Wrolstad singing, "One Fleeting
Hour.” James Ursin also sang a song.
Instrurm ntal solos were given by
George Leo Voelz playing the baritone,
Carl Voelz, playing the cornet,
and Harold Sundet, playing the violin.
This event, the first of its kind to
be given at the First Lutheran church,
was a complete success in every way
and will long be remembered as a redletter
evening by every one present.

Local Boxers Lose to Stratford
Most of the scoring in Monday’s
exhibition was by forfeits. Stratford
insisted on using the regulation 11
points for the basis of scoring and
that meant that W’ittenberg was short
five of the required weights to Stratford’s
two. O f the four regular bouts
Norman Johnson was the only winner
from the visiting team. Merton Farmer
was credited with a draw while
James Ringstad and Orton Lunde lost
their fights. A very large crowd witnessed
the fights with most of the enthusiasm
being shown by the ladies.
Wittenberg 8, Scandinavia 6
Wittenberg opened its spring baseball
season last Tuesday with a hard

Scandinavia team. The home
team, showing the lack of practice,
got off to a bad start and had to overcome
an early lead held by the visitors.
The local high school used three
pitchers during the contest— Ringstad,

Foreign Policy Showdown Seen
Over Roosevelt’s Peace A ppeal

Though U. S. citizens have been
wont to decry B ritain’s vaccilating
foreign policy, events of 1939 have
focused more than passing attention
on a sim ilar problem at home: Does
Washington officialdom agree on a
sound, well-reasoned foreign policy?
Is such a policy reflected in common-
sense national defense?
Most Americans think not, though
by and large they feel alike about
Hitler and Mussolini, dislike war
and want no part in an arms race.
Yet informed Americans agree both
Germany and Italy were m anhandled
at Versailles, agreeing also that
the U. S. must have “ adequate” defense,
even if it means an arms
race. On the subject of American
interference in foreign affairs there
is debate: One school prefers traditional
isolationism, though this

All Europe looked bad to him.
group also resents President Roosevelt
s strong reiteration of a longstanding
U. S. interest in Pan-American
solidarity. The other school
discards silent isolationism as no
longer possible in a world of fast
communications where politicians
ride the same boat with foreign
tradesmen.
Until early April, President Roosevelt
had accomplished little by way
of clarifying foreign policy, thanks
partly to an impasse with congress.
Each White House plump for internationalism
had been followed by
congressional plumping for isolationism,
until in one short week the
President apparently took the ball
from congress via three strokes that
made the U. S. citizenry conscious
of a definite interest in Europe's
fish kettle. First was the apparently
casual remark at Warm Springs,
where Mr. Roosevelt promised “ to
return in the fall if we don’t have a
w ar.” Later he explained that “ we”
meant western civilization, and that
the remark was actually planned to
“ give direction” to public thought.
Next, while congressional isolationism
began simmering, Mr.
Roosevelt told the Pan-American
Union's governing board that the
Western hemisphere is willing to
match "force to force” against ag- j
gression, in defense of New world ,
institutions and independence. By !
this time congressional isolation was I
boiling, but a few hours later the |
President delivered his biggest |
stroke—a frank appeal for world
peace via diplomatic note to Hitler
and Mussolini. Its gist: The President
would serve as intermediary
between dictator states and 31 nations
of Europe, North Africa and
Asia Minor, whose integrity he
wants them to respect. This would
lead to an international conference
for disarmament, economic settlem
ent and at least 10 years of mutually
guaranteed peace. Most fearful
quotation: “ P lainly the world is
moving toward . . . catastrophe unless
a more rational way of guiding
events is found.”
Congress held its breath awaiting
formal replies, too concerned for
reckless speech-making at the moment.
Isolationism’s cause seemed
defeated, yet even liberal internationalists
began worrying lest the
U. S. be summoned to serve 1917's
purpose again, i.e., bring peace to
traditionally quarrelsome Europe.
Idaho’s Sen. W illiam E. Borah
wrote: "This is not a war over the
questions of democracy or totalitarianism
. . . These European powers,
whatever their ideology or political
views, pursue one and the
same course . . They all violate
treaties, disregard . . . principals
of right, pursue methods which inevitably
lead to war and then call
upon the United States, Canada and
other nations to save them from
their own intolerable and vicious
methods."
Even so, the President’s personal
brand of foreign policy bore some
fruit. Though German-Italian rejection
was expected from the start,
favorable replies rained on Washington
so fast that one purpose was
definitely accomplished: World opinion
had at last been mobilized, drawing
peace-loving assurances from
lesser nations which fear dealing
with either the Axis or the Anglo-
French bloc, but who will speak
their minds to an intermediary.
Even more important was the psychological
effect. Slow in sending
their hostile, jointly prepared answers,
the Rome-Berlin axis inferentially
and involuntarily reminded
the world that Europe's two dictators
are guilty of aggression, moreover
will be responsible for the war
Europe soon expects.
Best anti-Roosevelt argument of
isolationists is that Italy and Germany
have already broken so many
agreements that the President’s
dream of a 10-year peace “ guarantee"
is rather futile. Second best
argument is that the note merely
gave impetus to B rita in’s warlike
Stop Hitler front, drawing France,
Russia and England closer to a m u tual
defense pact, which is probably
inspired by the unspoken hope that
the U. S. is willing to join the party
if need arises. Third argument is
that Axis chiefs may grow hostile
and seek revenge by discrediting
democracies via a new territorial
grab, such as Danzig, which Britain
and France have already agreed not
to protest. Since such renewed belligerence
would be a direct slap at
President Roosevelt, isolationists
still see hope for their cause.

Patterned after Red Cross and
Salvation Army, the Friends Service
committee was formed in P hiladelphia
during the World war by
Quakers. An earlier Philadelphia
Quaker was Joseph Scattergood,
who in 1880 built a Quaker preparatory
school at West Branch, Iowa.
Closed in 1931 for want of funds,
Scattergood school reopens May 1
for another sort of preparatory
work. Its m ain building renovated,
its caretaker’s home turned into a
dormitory, the institution will house
40 to 50 refugees who can spend a

bearings for a new life in the U. S.
Then they will shift for themselves,
m aking way for new arrivals.
Business
! A Republican. Edward J. Noble
built his confectionary business into
a mint called Life Savers before
President Roosevelt named him
chief of the civil aeronautics authority.
Because he represents business,
also because he believes— unlike
many businessmen—that U. S.
industry can move forward under
current governmental regulations.
Mr. Noble was too good a friend to
be left in the non-controversial field
of aeronautics. Result: He has been
named assistant to H arry L. Hopkins,
new commerce department
chief who is conscientiously trying
to make that traditionally dead-end
office into a vital aid to U. S. business.
But Harry Hopkins is admittedly
trying to sell the New Deal to business
(though not without carefully
removing obvious stumbling blocks)
and he may have his eye on the 1940
presidential campaign. Hence Mr.
Noble makes a good “ front m an ,”
and now the front m an is himself
looking for front men.
At his first press conference in
the new job, Mr. Noble gave U. S.
newspapers a want-ad for patriotic.

like himself, will take $1 a year
each to assist the department's business
expansion efforts. His purpose:
“ I want to get around me men
smarter than I am to do specific
jobs.”
Departmental objectives, in the
Noble opinion: (1) Restore confidence,
leading to increased business
volume, leading in turn to lower
taxes without disturbing government's
revenue or extraordinary expenditures;
(2) help industry reabsorb
the unemployed; (3) build
foreign trade, especially to combat
the Nazi-Fascist threat in South
America.

His 1939 relief vote may be a record
on which m any a senator and
congressman will rise or fall next
election. Reason: Congress is determined
to outlaw the present system,
substituting something closer
akin to state administration in which
states will also pay a bigger share.
If the plan succeeds, fine; if not,
disgruntled relief clients could make
hostile constituents at election time.
Major idea is that of South Carolina’s

unemployables. Federal supervision
would continue unabated, though bipartisan
administration would attempt
to quiet cries of politics-inrelief.
Many Republicans support the
Byrnes bill, but the solid congressional
economy front m ay break
down under relief debate. Going
whole hog against federal supervision,
Oregon's Sen. Charles l i Mc-
Nary (G. O. P. minority leader)
wants WPA eliminated entirely because
of serious ‘‘structural defects”
which inevitably produce periodic
‘‘scandals.” His program : (1) Return
relief administration to the
states; (2) create bi-partisan federal
boards to allocate funds; (3)
create bi-partisan state boards to
disburse relief money.
Though Senator Byrnes scoffed
m ainly at the impossibility of " b ip
artisan” boards, both proposals
had one other m ajo r defect, namely,
financing. Senator McNary would
compel states to contribute not less
than 25 per cent of funds spent within
their borders. Senator Byrnes
would have states pay one-third. The
stumbling block is that the U. S. will
not cut its tax levies, yet without
such cuts the 48 state* cannot raise
their levies to reassume relief costs
which the government began easing
from their shoulders in 1933. The
hoped-for solution, already under
discussion, calls for U. S. allocations

Signs of Impending Trouble for
National Labor Relations Board
Advocates of Amendment of Wagner Act Crow More
Vociferous; Law Itself and Its Administration Cause
Widespread Criticism; Some Expert Stalling.
By WILLIAM BRUCKART
WNU Service, National Pre** Bldg., Washington, D. C.
WASHINGTON —I t was only a
few years ago that any politician,
seeking a harvest of votes, would
rather have cut off his right arm
than offend organized labor. In a
close fight, the labor vote held the
balance of power. Labor unions
forged ahead with remarkuble force.
But labor started fighting within
its own ranks and there came the
C. I. O. Rather, John Lewis, the
leader of the mine workers, got am bitious
and broke away from the
old established and respected American
Federation of Labor and gave
birth to the Congress of Industrial
Organizations.
So. many politicians, including
President Roosevelt, turned to C. I.
O ., because it was modern, streamlined,
aggressive. It appeared, for
a time, that C. I. O. was going to
be the big power among the workers.
H aving that advantage, C. I. O.
went to town, as the football players
say. Its strength was manifest in
congress and under the impetus of
C. I. O. force. Senator Wagner, the
New York Democrat, brought forth
the national labor relations act, under
which the national labor relations
board was appointed and began
functioning.
That m uch is history.
B ut now there are signs of im pending
trouble for the national labor
relations board. With its m ain
support, the C. I. O., having its troubles
in collecting dues, and with
the peace efforts of President Roosevelt
who sought to get union men
of the United States back in one
organization having failed dismally,
the labor board is up against it. In
fact, to sum m arize the situation in
the homely expression of m y boyhood
home: it looks like the swashbuckling,
defiant calf is just about
ready to choke itself because of too
m uch rope. It may not happen in
this session of congress, but it will
happen before long. Why? The answer
is that organized labor, as represented
by the Lewis faction, made
the same mistake as greedy big
business frequently makes. It became
arrogant; it bit off more than
it could chew. The reaction has
now set in.
Demands for Am endment of
Labor A ct Crow Noisier
Advocates of amendment of the
Wagner labor act have been knocking
at the door a long time. Recently,
the knocking has resembled
sledge h am m er pounding. A very
large number of senators and representatives
have heard it.
As a m atter of fact, it was Mr.
Roosevelt’s efforts to get A. F. of L.
and C. I. O. back into a single national
union that has delayed the
moves in congress looking to am endment
of the labor law. C. I. O.,
having stood by the President when
he was a candidate and having
fought for his cause time after time,
was entitled to the President’s services
as a peace negotiator. Many
persons thought there would be a
happy reunion, but there was no
chance at all from the very outset
of the negotiations, and the affair
did nothing to lift Mr. Roosevelt's
prestige, especially in the rural
areas where C. I. O. and sit-down
■trikes have much the same meaning.
While the administration's plans
for a union reunion were slipping,
there came that sensational verdict
by a federal court jury in P hiladelphia
which assessed $700,000 d am ages
against the sit-down strikers
in a hosiery plant. The damages
were assessed directly against the
men who did the job, and thus for
the first time a responsibility, as
well as a right, was given to labor.
The right to strike long has been established
and labor must guard it;
never before, however, had there
been a court determination that liability
also exists if damage is done.
It is unnecessary here to review
what the labor relations board has
been doing. Time after tim e, it has
been accused of dancing to the bagpipes
played by C. I. O. The American
Federation of Labor, among
other critics, has charged it with
rank C. I. O. favoritism. The board
does not consist of persons capable
of winning very much respect. True,
I believe they have very alert and
fast-moving minds, but I cannot help
regarding them as without any trace
of ju dicial temperament. Without
doubt, the country would be better
off had all three members been
ousted months ago.
Act an d U t Administration
Causes Widespread Criticism
It is, perhaps, as much because of
the terrible administration of the
law as from the inequities of the
loosely drawn law itself that the
criticism has been so widespread.
Hundreds of cases, coming before
the board, have left employers with
personal losses as a result of onesided
determinations. Labor unions,
affiliated with the American Federation
of Labor, have repeatedly asserted
they could not obtain justice
1 if the C. i. O. figured in the situation.
In any event, there are now
senators and representatives sponsoring
a hatfull of amendments to
the law, and a large number of these
amendments are being promoted by
the A. F. of L. lobby at the capitol.
There is one amendment, for instance,
that proposes to disband the
present three-man board and supplant
it with a five-man board. That,
of course, is the political maneuver
to get rid of people with whom congress
is disgusted. The amendment
is by Senator Walsh, Massachusetts
Democrat.
Senator Walsh also has introduced
several other amendments, one of
which, in particular, is worth noting.
It would attempt, at least, to elimij
nate ‘‘prejudicial delays.” That
; sounds rather academic. It is, how-
■ ever, important because, according
j to the A. F. of L. explanation, de-
| lays by the board have worked, or
| have been used, to the advantage of
C. I. O. If the C. I. O. was not sure
that it had a m ajority, according to
the other union, rather thinly disguised
reasons for delays were
brought up. Then, C. I. O. organizers
would start their drives.
Whether the A. F. of L. charges
are true and whether the criticisms
of employers have been justified, it
remains as fact that C. I. O. is
now opposing amendment to the a c t
Hearings A re Delayed by
Various S talling Maneuvers
Supporters of the law in its present
form and defenders of the board
as it is now made up succeeded for
example in delaying hearings on
amendments to the act for more
than a month. They urged Senator
Thomas of Utah, committee chairm
an , not to hold hearings while
peace negotiations were in progress.
They insisted that it was unfair
to embarrass the President in
his attempts to restore unity in the
labor movement, and argued that
hearings would bring bitter state-
| ments into print. Mr. Thomas yielded
to the plea for delay, but eventually
the pressure for action became
too strong even for the Utah senator
to resist.
And the friends of the law were
right when they anticipated bitter
words. Senator Wagner in his testimony
spoke rather blatantly about
critics being unacquainted with the
purposes of the law. He felt, too,
that there was no need for haste
about changes. He rather hinted
that there were some Ethiopian gentlemen
in the woodpile, but failed to
put his finger on them. He simply
was standing pat about the whole
thing.
A little later, however, the C. I. O.
people named the terrible “ conspirators”
who wanted the act changed.
The American Federation of Labor
had "conspired" with the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States.
There was the fine unseen hand, the
Chamber of Commerce, big business,
personified. It wos the guilty
party; it was speaking for the em ployers
who want to grind poor
workmen into the dust, destroy unionism,
wreck the families of the
wage earners—or so the C. I. O.
shouted. Well, as far as I am concerned,
I fail to see why the C. I. O.
picked the Chamber of Commerce.
It is so thoroughly discredited that
it hasn't had any influence at the
capitol in 10 years. Why anyone
should think that the Chamber of
Commerce could have started a
movement as strong as the present
demand for change of the labor act
is quite beyond me. But that was
what the C. I. O. charged. It may
have been what Senator Wagner
meant.
Say Changes W o u ld Benefit
Neither Labor Nor Industry
F inally, the labor board itself appeared
before the senate com m ittee
and announced it had an “ open
m in d .” Its mind was so open that
it submitted a document of 360 typewritten
pages, analyzing the proposals
for changes and arriving generally
at the conclusion that the proposed
changes were no good. In
substance, the board said that thc
bulk of thc changes being pressed
“ would benefit neither labor group,
nor would they be of help to industry.”
Most of all, in the labor
board's mind, the amendments
would “ conflict with the basic purposes
of the act.”
Thus, as the hearings were concluded
and the committee seeks to
do some deliberating on its own account,
labor finds itself still fighting
within itself, lacking direction
and one could almost say, lacking
purpose. It is too bad that there
must be the same greed, the same
thirst for power within the ranks
of worker* as there is among political
leaders and heads of government*.
Those fellows who play the
game of politic* can lose their job*,
and the country is none the worse
But when political labor leaders
play their games and lose, the pawns
are the workers who have no mean*
of protection.

Proper Watering
p*ACH year, more and more gar-
*-* deners are learning that gardens
should not be watered by
sprinkling.
Sprinkling usually moistens the
surface soil only and thus the roots
naturally come up there for water.
When the root system is concentrated
near the surface there is
more danger of injury by hoeing;
and if sprinkling is not done constantly,
plants will be quickly affected
by drouth.
Considered from the tim e angle,
moreover, sprinkling is im practical.
Many hours can be wasted
holding the hose and directing the
spray. Time of watering is not of
great importance, but it is usually
considered more economical to
water thoroughly early in the forenoon
or late in the afternoon since
the soil can then be thoroughly
soaked with less loss from evaporation.
The most efficient method of watering,
according to Walter H. Nixon,
Ferry Seed Breeding Station
vegetable expert, is to lay the
hose on the ground. Do not have
too heavy a flow of water, or there
will be a washing of soil and exposure
of roots. Let the water
run slowly in one place for 20
minutes to half an hour. K E E P

C H A P T E R ^ X —Continued
The second day after that Hale
and Jo a n and Bert again departed
in young Kneeland’s motor-boat and
cruised about till evening. They
lunched at the cam p to which they
had taken Stuyvesant. The day was
a delightful one. Bert was at his
quiet best. Joan looked better and
was in unusually good spirits. As
always with her now, good spirits
found expression in a steady baiting
of Uncle Casper’s new secretary.
"T im e is flying,” she informed
Hale, after luncheon. Bert had tactfully
spread himself out for a nap
under the pines that formed the
back curtain of the picnic ground.
Ju st out of earshot Joan and Hale
sat on a rug, side by side, their
backs propped against trees. “ In
another month,” Joan went on, "you
will be Mr. Stuyvesant’s young man,
not mine. The reflection makes me
desperate. 1 feel that something
must be done. I must inquire into
your state of m ind .”
" I know only too well what those
inquiries will be.” Rex groaned.
“ Ali right. Speak to me of love.
You can sing it if you want to. In
fact, I ’d rather you sang.”
"O n the contrary,” Joan assured
him , " I ’m going to be extremely
practical. I ’m going to put an abstract
case to you.” She closed her
eyes as if in deep concentration.
"W e m ay have to consider, say, a
rich young girl, full of charm of
person and character, who has no
expensive tastes. Though her income
is more than forty thousand a
year she never spends more than
ten thousand of it. That includes
her small share of the running expenses
of two houses— a town house
and a sum m er cam p .”
Hale grasped his opportunity with
enthusiasm.
"A n d I ’m going to tell you that
she’s a shocking case,” he broke in
severely. "H a s she no sense of the
responsibilities of wealth? That
money wasn’t given her to be piled
up in banks. She’s expected to go
in for charitable works. She’s supposed
to share with her less fortunate
brothers and sisters—”
Before his sentence was finished
he realized his slip, but it was too
late.
"T h a t’s exactly what she wants to
do,” Jo a n interrupted eagerly. "She
wants to share it with a less fortunate
brother. She knows of a poor
little brother that thinks he must
struggle along on ten thousand a
year. That’s what I wanted to talk
to you about. Don’t you see that
with his ten thousand, and her ten
thousand, they can get along perfectly?
It would be an equal partnership.
They could—”
Rex had found his breath.
" I don’t know your poor little
brother,” he said coldly. "B u t if
he’s worth his salt he won’t want a
wife who has to pay half their living
expenses. He’ll pay them as
he goes. I should think he’d go pretty
quick,” he predicted gloomily,
" i f he’s made fun of twelve hours a
day, like a man I know. Speaking
of going quickly,” he added with
animation, "Stuyvesant wants me to
start with h im in a week or two.
H e’s got a big new contract. He
needs help.”
Jo a n nodded thoughtfully.
" I know,” she admitted. "Y o u ’re
getting restless and ready to escape.
That’s why I want your views
on these important questions. I
hardly dare to ask them. You have
such a hunted look in your eyes all
the time. I suppose some girl is
pursuing you.”
" I f I look hunted it’s no more
than I feel,” Rex admitted sulkily.
"Som e girl is pursuing me. Why
doesn’t she have a closed season on
me till I go back to New York?
That would give me a chance to
brace up for my new jo b .”
"A nd all the tim e ,” Joan went on
calmly, "you love that girl to distraction.
You know it and she
knows it. Was there ever a woman
who d idn’t know when a man loved
her?” she interrupted herself to ask.
“ One’s always reading about them,
i But do they exist outside of books?
j I don’t think so. However, that’s a
! side issue. What I ’m saying, Rex,
is that you love that girl to dis-
1 traction. I t ’s only her money that
stands between you two, as novelj
ists would say. Well, why should
I it? You were mad about her from
the first week you met her,” she
went on calmly. “ You decided it
would never do, and she read your
m ental processes as if they were
written on the wall. You weren’t
going ts* be considered a fortunehunter.
You weren’t going to live
on any woman’s money. You
weren’t going to do this and you
weren’t going to do that. All you
thought about was yourself, and
your feelings and your life. You
never gave a thought to her, or to
her feelings or to her life. It was
the most abominable selfishness I
ever saw.”
She let that sink In and then continued
hotly.
“ But you forgot another thing.
You’r* to old-fashioned in vour
ideas that you actually thought she
was like you. You thought she
would be a shy maidenly young
thing eating her ljeart out for love
of you, while you hustled around
looking for a poor girl to m arry
and support. Well, from what 1
know of her she’s not that kind.”
She stopped again. He did not speak
and she went on.
“ No girl is that kind these days.
If the m an hasn’t sense enough or
pep enough to ask the girl he loves
to m arry him, she throws her m aidenly
modesty to the wind, if she
ever had any. She grabs him before
some other girl gets -him. He
might as well make up his m ind—”
Rex sighed.
“ This discourse is very interesting,”
he admitted. "Y o u ought to
give addresses before women’s
clubs.”
“ I may, some day. Just now,
I ’m busy. I ’m trying my theories
on you.”
“ Are there many more of them ?”
Rex asked anxiously.
“ There are—lots. For instance,
if a m an hasn’t a situation I can
worth—had all professed their devotion
until she refused to listen to
them. He knew what this sort of
thing had done to the girl. It had
made her suspicious and a trifle
hard. He knew her opinion of fortune-
hunters. What he did not know,
could not be sure of, was the nature
of her real feeling for him. How
much of her talk was raillery? How
much, if any, was sincere? Today,
at last, she had jolted him into selfbetrayal.
Recalling that look in her
eyes, and her final words—for once
so serious—he suspected that the
self-betrayal was not all on his side.
But here, too. he was not sure. She
was a good actress.
That night she deliberately avoided
him . She dined with Mrs. Nash,
and he was almost sure that she
had asked for the invitation over the
telephone. She took Bert with her
as escort through the woods. Hale
had to content himself with the society
of Miss Hosanna. who was also
unusually silent, and of Mrs. Spencer
Forbes, who earned his wordless
gratitude by talking steadily.
All three sat before the light blaze
" I miss those powders Haines brought me.’
imagine his hesitating to propose 1
to a girl who is handicapped by
money—”
"W ell, that’s progress,” Rex said
hastily. "Y o u couldn’t imagine that,
a fortnight ago.”
" I could, but I d id n’t. Don’t interrupt
me. What I ’m getting at is
this question. When a young man
has a job and good prospects, is he
justified in ignoring a g irl’s breaking
heart and leaving her to the horrors
of a spinster’s life? You have
only to read any modern novel, or
see any modern play, to realize exactly
what such horrors are.”
Rex laughed.
"Y o u ’re awfully entertaining,
Jo a n ,” he assured her. " I f I wasn’t
always the butt of your good spirits
I ’d enjoy you more. But go on, as
long as you like. I can take it/*
Jo a n ’s spirits dropped as suddenly
as they had risen.
" I ’m tired of you,” she abruptly
announced. She stood up. " I think
I ’ll get me to a nunnery, where I
won’t be irritated by stubborn young
men who don’t know happiness
when she knocks at their door.”
For a moment they stood facing
one another. On a sudden impulse
Rex caught her hands.
"J o a n ,” he said unsteadily, "le t’s
got down to brass tacks. When I ’m
earning twenty-five thousand a year
I ’m going to ask you to m arry me.
I* don’t think it will take long—not
more than a few years. But—I
wish you’d wait for m e.”
The long look she gave him was a
strange one. He thought o f it
throughout that day. It seemed
made up in equal parts of understanding,
humor and tolerance, with
perhaps a touch of impatient scorn.
"Y o u love yourself more than you
do m e,” she said at last.
"T ha t.” he said more unsteadily
than before, " is n ’t true. You know
it isn’t true.”
"1 know that your pride means
more to you than I do,” she told
him slowly. " I don’t know whether
I ’m prepared to stand by and watch
you nurse your pride for years. I
hardly think I am . But if this is
a proposal. Mr. Hale, I ’ll give it due
consideration.”
Before he could stop her she had
drawn her hands away and walked
over to the sleeping Bert. She woke
him , and peremptorily announced
that she was going home. She did
not speak during the return journey.
Rex maintained a miserable silence.
He was unhappy but he could
not feel that he was wrong. He had
learned from chance remarks made
by Miss Hosanna, by Mrs. Spencer
Forbes, by Mrs. Nash, that almost
every young m an Joan Kneeland
knew had asked her to m arry him
He knew that the three in the house
that summer—Bert, Craig and Ainswith
which Miss Hosanna saw fit to
brighten the living-room, even on
warm evenings. She pretended that
she did it to dispel dampness and
protect the piano. Mrs. Spencer
Forbes broke into her own monologue
with an unexpec ted comment.
" I miss those powders Haines
brought m e ,” she said abruptly. She
added as Miss Hosanna stiffened
and stared at her. “ Oh, you needn’t
look so surprised, Hosanna. Rex
knows all about it. It was he who
took it on himself to order Haines
off the place. He threatened him
with the police if he ever came here
again. I ’m annoyed with you,” she
assured Rex.
He was ruffled enough to imitate
her frankness.
" I f you’re annoyed you ought to
be grateful, too,” he said simply.
" I f you really miss that stuff so
much it had a stronger hold on you
than you realized.”
To his surprise she agreed with
this at once.
" I t shows how little we understand
ourselves and how much we
can overestimate our will power.”
She admitted, " I ’m not suffering.
But I ’m restless and uneasy. I miss
the stuff, as you call it, as a confirmed
smoker misses his tobacco.
I begin to think that I ’m really under
obligations to you. You ought
to be, too, Hosanna,” she ended
cheerfully. "Y o u were fussing and
preaching to me all last year. This
year you haven’t preached; but it
must be a comfort to you to know
I ’m a reformed character. For I
shan’t go back to it. There’s one
lesson, and only one, so far as I
know, that I ’ve learned in my halfcentury
of living. I make more mistakes
than most people. But at
least I ’ve learned not to make the
same mistake twice.”
Hale glanced at Miss Hosanna.
He expected some comment on this,
some evidence of relief. None came.
Miss Hosanna, busy with the knitting
that occupied her spare hours,
neither spoke nor raised her eyes
from her work. He was not even
sure that she had heard. Certainly
she had not been listening to R uth’s
previous monologue. She had worn
all evening the effect of one so deeply
withdrawn into her own subconsciousness
that she heard or saw little
around her. He became aware
that Mrs. Spencer Forbes was looking
at her, too. She was looking
with what, in anyone else, might
have seemed anxiety But that must
be a mistake. Mrs. Spencer Forbes
was never anxious about anyone.
Hale went for a lonely walk along
the beach. It was a beautiful night.
The moonlight reminded him that
he had been at Halcyon C am p almost
two months. There had been
moonlight on the night of his arrival.
He remembered the glory of
the moon’s path across the sea.
Well, he had done something in that
time. Mentally he put his achievements
in the order of their importance.
He had fallen in love. He
must admit that now. He had rid
the Camp of Craig He had also got
Ainsworth out of it. Indirectly, he
had probably saved Mrs. Spencer
Forbes from becoming a heroin addict.
Now. all should be smooth sailing
at Halcyon C am p—but it was not.
He had brought upon himself Jo a n ’s
anger and contempt. He couldn’t
feel that his results had impressed
Kneeland very much. Probably
Kneeland would increasingly feel
that Ainsworth had got the better of
him. and that Bert’s danger from
Craig had been largely imagined.
It might be a good idea to bid Halcyon
Camp a fond farewell, express
his appreciation to its inmates.
and go back to New York
the end of the week. Stuyvesant
would be glad to have him start in.
He had said as much. Yes, his usefulness
here was over. O r was it?
The face of Joan swung before
him, and he experienced a complete
mental face-sbout. He couldn’t
*leave Joan at Halcyon Camp. He
didn’t know why, but he couldn’t.
His reasons were so slight, so incredible,
that he would not dwell on
them. He would have been h um ili
ated to have anyone, even Stuyvesant,
know that he had sent that
m ilk to New York for analysis. He
was ashamed of having done it His
suspicions—as persistent and as irritating
as the buzzing of a mosquito
around one’s face at night—were as
unimportant as the mosquito would
have been. He had no real grounds
for them. He had only one of his infernal
hunches.

Swingle,
Am erica’s 68-year-old plant wizard,
in a unique and friendly deal which
probably will ring more cash registers
than would Mussolini if he
swallowed all the Balkans in one
gulp.
Busy all over the world for 40
years or more, Mr. Swingle has
created enough new wealth with his
plant conjuring to build a sizable
battle fleet. Brazil, getting cn Uncle
Sam ’s cuff for $120,000,000, breaks
precedent among debtor nations by
immediately getting busy in a long- ]
range effort to set up a favorable
trade balance and get square with
the export-import bank. She thinks
Mr. Swingle can show her how to
grow many things which we urgently
need. Furthermore, she intends
to become entirely independent of
aggressor nations, not by ersatz or
by a strong-arm economy, but by
scientific utilization of her natural
resources in soil and climate. Mr.
Swingle departs for Brazil with the
sanction and co-operation of the
department of agriculture. His expenses
are paid by the Brazilian
government.
Tung oil trees, rubber and
quinine will get Mr. Swingle's
immediate attention. Brazil
thinks that, with some expert
coaching by Mr. Swingle, she
ran bring all these through as
negotiable assets in interest or
amortization day. It looks to
this observer like a sunny break
in the blizzard of screwball economics
which has been sweeping
over the world. The above will
be just a starter. Mr. Swingle’s
research will cover virtually
the entire range of Brazilian
agriculture and forestry.
A native of Pennsylvania, a botanist,

He brought Egyptian cotton to Arizona
and Acala cotton to California,
and helped establish the date industry
in the latter state. In Florida,
he achieved miracles of hybridization
in citrus fruits. He added im measurably
to the knowledge of pollenization,
hopped up the seeing
power of the microscope, and, in
French, German, and English, wrote
authoritative treatises on plant
pathology, cytology, taxonomic botany
and citrus propagation. His
fame is widely international and he
is a member of every important scientific
society in his field.
A homespun American, he is
as clubby as a suburban gardener,
exchanging garden lore over
the back fence with his neighbor.
His export of ideas and
seeds and cuttings has yielded
vastly more goodwill and tangible
wealth than our exports of

run up into billions.

Neurotics Are Benefited by Friendly
Puppy Around the Home, Authority Says
U n c le P h il'C \
U c L tji:
M a k e It a V a c a tio n
Most people grumble at a detour
instead of relaxing on it.
We cherish some of our prejudices.
They are worthy ones.
The wise man studies others so
that he can learn from their m istakes
and profit at their expense.
But W h o A r e th e Jo n e s e s ?
All the nations in naval arm a ment
act as if they are “ keeping
up with tha Joneses.”
Inefficiency usually lies in incapacity
to observe closely.
A soft job may be one that you
have worked at so hard that you
know how to do it—soft.
A n d T hdt G o e s fo r Life
It isn’t love altogether that
makes a m arriage a success. I t ’s
mixed with common sense.
The neurotic, substitute halfback
may be able to pull a hopeless game
out of the fire with an inspired
touchdown, but the back who makes
the All-American will be a lad who
carries the mail in game after
game. The answer is simple. The
boy who can deliver his best at all
times is dependable because he is
without a host of inhibitions. He
has had a normal boyhood in which
dogs, rough games, and self-respect
played big parts.
Dogs are tremendously important
to children, and they prevent the
development of the neurosis. In deed,
dogs often can put adults back
on the m ain track after they have
wandered into the by-ways. Excessive
fussiness over one’s clothing and
one’s home is a sure sign of neurotic
influence. This is the heme
underlaying the article, “ A Positive
Cure for Neatness,” by Loring H.
Dodd, which appears in the American
Kennel Gazette.
The article tells the story of two
people—a man and his wife—who
were so spic and span about their
personal appearance and about
their home that it was almost painful.
Then they bought a cocker
spaniel puppy. Soon things began
to happen to some of their choicest
possessions. Rugs and chair legs
were chewed. Stains appeared with
alarm ing frequency. And when the
puppy was put outside, whines
spoiled their quiet evenings. So the
puppy was sent away.
But during the weeks these people
had owned the pup, the tyke had
done something else. It had stolen
into their hearts in such manner
that—with the puppy gone— they
missed it terribly Soon they bought
it back at twice the original price,
and were happy. From that moment
on, they forgot about muddy
paws and other trifling inconveniences.
They became human.
Peoplt who once learn about dogs
are never satisfied to be without
these splendid pets, and they always
make certain their children have
the benefit of good dogs.
Flying Fish Build Nests
Flying fish emulate birds not only
in taking to the air; they also build
nests. To be sure, their nests are
no more like birds' nests than their
“ flight” is like the flight of birds.
Nevertheless they are nests, with
the eggs of flying fish in them. Dr.
E. W. Gudger of the American Museum
of Natural History, in a report
prepared for the American Naturalist,
summarized all the information
available about these flsh-nests.
They are made in clumps of floating
gulfweed or sargassum, and the
stringy masses of eggs are not only
sheltered in the nests, but serve to
tie the structure together. For a
long time it had been thought that
these gulfweed nests were the work
of the little sargaasumflsh, a fantastic
little “ finger-finned” creature
that lurks in the masses of floating
seaweed.
T W O years ago, it appeared that
4 John Logie Baird, the mop-haired
garret inventor who took the lead in
British television, was running sec-
„ . n • j ond to other in-
Su n s e f R e d a n d Ventors The
M o rn in g G r a y ; postmaster gen-

against him in
picking the Marconi-Emi system for
the British Broadcasting corporation.
But now his system is working
in London motion picture theaters
and his representatives are here
to install it in several Broadway
houses.
The son of a Scottish country
parson, in an old tweed coat and
slacks, he lived meagerly in a
dark soho attic and worked with
■ set of carpenter's tools, a vacuum
tube and a few magnets,
with no results. When he started
thinking his war through a
problem, he went to bed. He
bad been In bed a couple of
weeks, when, almost despairing,
he saw a red sunset through the
window. That suggested a takeoff
from the infra-red zone of
the spectrum. O n February 3,
192R, he flashed a picture across
the ocean, a ghost face flickering
on the wall of the dark cellar ol
A. M. Hart, of Hartsdale, N. Y.
In the old days, his trousers were
patched, his hair was a brush heap,
and he usually had one sock drooping.
Now, as president of Baird :
Television, Ltd., he is slicked up a
lot, and, according to all accounts,
is becoming a magnate. “ Sunset
red and morning gray start the traveler
on hi* way."

and 10 days notice of strikes in those
cases involving perishable or agricui
tural products. It abolishes the present
state labor board, and replaces it
with a new board to be appointed by
Governor Heil.
Although the highway aid bill in
troduced by the county representa
tives passed the legislature by huge
majorities, there was strong opposition
from influential sources, princi
pally because it is felt that the administration’s
financial situation is so
acute that use of highway monies for
general state purposes may be forced
The new aid law will^decrease the
state highway commission’s free fund
by more than half, it was pointed out
and will remove any possibility of
ilsing highway revenues in case the
state financial emergency becomes
more serious.

John W. Roach, new chief of the inspection
and enforcement branch of
the state beverage tax division, has
called upon local authorities to exercise
greater vigilance in the granting
of liquor and beverage licenses
order to weed out undesirable elements
from the liquor and beer industry.
Roach, who since his appointment
to the state police job a few weeks
ago has emphasized the moral aspects
of the tavern business, declared that
municipalities will have to rid themselves
of “dumps and dives.’* He
pointed out that the time for renewal
of local licenses is nearing. July 1.
He demanded that town boards, and
particularly the town boards of townships
which abut cities, exercise great
care in investigating the character of
the applicants for tavern permits.
Milk Prices
Milk prices, the most important element
in Wisconsin economic life, continue
to dominate legislative affairs.
Lieutenant Governor Walter S. Goodland
has proposed pegging the price |
of all milk §old within the state toj
$2.50 a cwt. An assembly bill by
Maurice Fitzsimmons proposes pegging
to guarantee cost of production
with provisions for parity payments I
to be met by proceeds of a sales ta x .!
Senator Phil Nelson has introduced a j
bill which has aroused much interest!
and which would regulate milk prices!
and production by a state agency as j
the public service commission regulates
electric, gas and other utilities, j
Several cost of production bills have!
also been offered, and Assemblyman
Nicholas Bichler of Ozaukee county
wants to reenact the fluid milk control
law. under which the department of
agriculture fixes prices in urban
markets, for two more years. Milk is
going to have an important place in
the deliberations of the lawmakers in
the capitol for the next few months.

On Manners in Church
H >w to behave in church is something
which has to be learned. Not
only outsiders but often confirmed believers
are appallingly ignorant of
church etiquette. Recently a book has
been published by Mary Perkins entitled,
“At Ease in the Catholic
Church.” This work not only deals
with manners in church but also tells
how to address a Cardinal, archbishop,
bishop; what to give a priest or an
ordinand as a present (a check is correct),
and so on. Mary Perkins will
undoubtedly rank as the “ Emily Post”
»f the Catholic Church— the authority
in correct church conduct and usage.
It would be well if an Emily Post
*f Protestant churches would write a
pamphlet on “How to Behave in
I Church.” Just off hand I can suggest
a few rules of behavior myself:
1. When you enter the church, take
your seat quietly and bow your head
in a word of prayer. (There’s time to
see who else is in church after services).
2. Take a seat near the front of the
church so that late comers can sit
down in the rear seats (and don’t run
out several times before you settle
down).
3. If you attended Sunday school
and received a Sunday school paper,
J wait till after services to read it. (It
is annoying to both pastor and congregation
to hear paper rattling and
to see some one absorbed in a story
! during worship).
4. Be attentive during the sermon.
There is nothing more disconcerting
than having a few people in the
audience who are whispering and
snickering.
5. Sleep at home
6. Spit out your
enter the church.
j finding an old wad of gum under a pew
| and certainly no one enjoys the sound
1 of chewing— you know the old rhyme
about the gum-chewing girl and the
j cud-chewing cow?)
7. I f you must bring your baby to
church, sit near the back.
8. Sing the responses and hymns.
Don’t leave all the singing to the choir.
9. Manicure your fingernails at
home.
10. Remember— you come to church
to worship God.
I am sure you, dear reader, can add
a number of “do’s’’ and “don’ts” of|
your own to this list. After all, it is
! important to know "How to Behave in
i Church!”

ADVENTURERS’ CLUB
H I A D M N K S P R OM T H I I I V I S
OP P E O P L E L I K E Y O U R S K L P I
“ H orror o f the Gray Spots”
He l l o , e v e r y b o d y :
Adventure just happens to m ost people, but Jim Burnett
o f E ast Rutherford, N. J., goes out and hunts for his thrills. Y ou
know, I ’ v e alw ays fe lt that you’ ll have just as many adventures
I f you stay-righ t at home and let them hunt you up. But Jim
Eeems to have had pretty good success with his system, too. In
the last 20 years or so, Jim has adventured in 54 countries. But
the biggest scare he ever got in his life was that time, w ay back
in the interior o f B razil, when he ran into the Adventure o f the
G ray Spots.
In D ecem ber, 1922, Jim and his pal Jay M cK a y w ere on their
w a y up the Am azon on an errand of vengeance. A Portuguese ,
half breed had killed M cK a y ’ s fath er and fled upstream to hide
in the wilderness. Jim and Jay had a hunch that they would
find him in the G era l Indian country, and they had started of!
after him.
F or two weeks they traveled up-river in a m olloca, a type
o f canne used on the Am azon, turned south to ascend the
R iv e r Purus and, a fter a w eek ’s paddling, picked up the m urderer's
tra il from an Indian who said that a half-breed w as hiding with a certain
G era l tribe on a stream that branched off the Purus a few m ile s farther on.
V oyagers Reach End of Th eir Trail.
Th ey had paddled all that night, and dawn found them at the mouth
o f the unnamed tributary of the Purus that the Indian had described.

Then both o f them turned and started to run back to their canoe.
U p that little stream they went. In a couple m ore hours they w ere at
the spot to which the Indian had directed them— the end of their trail.
Th ey ran their boat ashore on a narrow , sandy beach, and
started ashore. Back in the ju ngle they could see an Indian v illa
ge, and a group of balf a doien natives com ing forw ard to m eet
them . “ The G era l Indians w ere once considered the most sava
ge on the South A m erican continent,” says Jim , "b u t w e advanced
boldly tow ard the handful before us.”
It w as a tense situation, and Jim and Jay knew it. T h e Indians
m ight be peaceably disposed— and then again they m ight not. And even
though they m ight be inclined to be peaceable, they certainly wouldn't
fe el any too frien dly to the tw o w hite men when they learned their errand
w as to take aw ay the fu gitive they had been sheltering. Y es— it was a
tense situation all right— but nothing Jim or Ja y had y et im agined was
as bad as what actually happened.
Th e Indians w ere about twenty paces aw ay when Jim saw
them — the gra y spots. The skins of ev ery one of those Indians
w ere gray and blotchy and spotted— spotted with the m ost dreadfu
l disease known to the w orld. L ep rosy !
Jim y elled : "S top, M c K a y— sto p !” M cK a y uttered just one
w ord. “ L e p e r s !” Then both o f them turned and started to run
back to their canoe.
T h ey reached the rive r bank together, leaped over it and
landed on the beach— right on top of a couple o f Indian boys who
had circled around them to see what they could steal from the
boat. "T h e y turned on us and fought us fiercely .” says Jim,
“ no doubt resenting our catching them at it. They scratched
and bit and kicked us before, finally w e heaved them bodily out
onto the sand and pushed our m olloca into the rive r amid a bedlam
of shouts from the advancing Indians.
F ea r of Leprosy Haunts the T w o Men.
“ F o r the m om ent w e had just one single thought in our minds— to
get aw ay from the im m ediate neighborhood. It w asn't until a fter a quarter
of an hour of hard paddling, when w e w ere a m ile aw ay down stream ,
that w e realized, with a strange, sinking sensation in the pits of our
stom achs that w e had handled the leprous w retches— that they had bitten
and scratched us.”
Jim says that w orrying about their exposure to leprosy was
bad enough, but the real horror of the business didn't hit them
until a w eek later. Then, tiny, round gray spots began to appear
on his and Jay M c K a y 's w rists and arm s. "T h e shock," says
Jim , "w a s terrific. In fact, M c K a y 's hair turned snow w hite— at
the a ge of thirty. I wished that I w ere dead then and there, and
I guess M cK a y did, too. H a ve you e v er seen the Louisiana leper
colony, or been in the Ladrones? I had alw ays pitied those poor
gray-skinned victim s o f a livin g death— and now I was becom ing
one m yself.”
T h ey pushed on down the rive r. In another two weeks the spots
had spread over their entire bodies. L ife , then, was like a nightm are.
F or there they w ere, thousands o f m iles awajf from civilization, coming
down with the w orld ’s m ost dreaded disease. And even gettin g back to
civilization would be scant com fort. N ot even modern m edicine can cure
that hateful, w asting m alady of which those spots w ere the first awful
sym ptom .
H orror Grows W orse as T im e Passes.
" T h e ghastly horror,” says Jim , " g r e w on us day by day. We paddied
along m echanically, like a couple of automatons, wishing to heaven
w e'd die— trying to get up the courage to end our mental agony. As we
paddled, w e prayed. We knew that no prayer could cure us, but I believe
today that they saved us from a w orse fa te— m ad n ess!”
And then, one day as they w ere rounding a turn near the mouth of
the M aderia rive r, they cam e upon another w hite m an—a doctor from
the English hospital at Porto Velho, and Jim says that if there e v e r was
a m essenger from heaven com e in answer to a prayer, Doctor King w a s
that messenger. T h ere in the ju ngle he gave them a brief examination,
and then he told them the news. .
“ B oys,” he said, " I know you’ ve been suffering the tortures of
the damned, but you can stop w orryin g. Your cases are a rare
form of false leprosy—a disease that looks a lot like the real
thing, but which a good rest and a little m edical attention will
take care of. It w on't be long before you 're as fit as e v e r ."
T h at ended those two lads' m ission of vengeance. Th ey never did
eatch the killer. But Jim hopes that if Jay M cK a y is in this country
he reads this yarn. A fter all these years, he'd like to see him again.

ago as 1747. W idely cultivated in
the Far East, it is usually seen by
visitors around Buddhist tem ples
and other religious sanctuaries The
pointed leaves of the Pagoda tree
are dark green above, gray underneath.
The bark is deeply fissured
and corrugated The older trees
have much of the appearance of the
borne in la rge much-branched panicles.
In the Orient trees 80 feet
tall, with trunks 12 feet in girth and
an abundance o f picturesque
gnarled, wide-spreading roots, are
frequently to be seen. Th ere are
several distinct varieties, the most
picturesque of the P a g o d a tree s
having pendant, c r o w d e d bran ch es

By the tim e of P e ck ’ s death in
1857 his journals numbered some S3
manuscript volum es which he w illed
to a library. A t the beginning of
the C ivil w ar, the librarian went
aw ay to fight and P e c k ’s m aterial
was stored tem porarily. When the
library w as m oved to new quarters
at the end o f the w ar it w as left
behind and eventu ally was acquired
by a paper m ill and turned into
cardboard. Thus much priceless historical
inform ation was lost.
