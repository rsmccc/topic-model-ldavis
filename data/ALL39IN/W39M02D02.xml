         <p>Car License Reprieve
Wisconsin car owners need have no
fear of arre st for driving: with the old
1938 license plates‚a t least not until
a fter March 15
The first bill signed by Governor
Julius P Heil allows car owners an
extra month and 15 days for payment
of license fees Car licenses prior to
the action of the legislature and Governor
were due February 1
Since 1931 when the legislature
recommended in special session that
officials be lenient for a month or two
in enforcing auto license laws each
succeeding legislature has granted additional
time for the payment of auto
taxes In the even numbered years
when the legislature has not been in
session license date extensions have
been made by order of the Governor
and the secretary of state
It is possible th at the 1939 legislature
may reduce the cost of auto licenses
for 1940 An im portant plank
in the Republican platform last November
bills have already been introduced
which would reduce fees Governor
Heil in an address before the
annual sta te road school in Milwaukee
last week pointed out that he favors a
reduction of fees especially for the
sm aller cars He believes that such
reduction would bring out on to the
roads the many cars now laid up and
that the loss of the fees themselves
would be made up many times by the
increase in sums returned to the state
in gasoline taxes
The Governor also informed listeners
at the road school th at some diversion
of gasoline taxes would be necessary
He explained that without the
tran sfer of highway funds for other
purposes some other form of taxation
would be necessary to cover the expenses
of the state
A bill before the senate by Senator
Yindra of Manitowoc would place
highway money in a special fund and
make illegal the use of such money
for any purpose other than highway
construction or improvement
Repeal Teachers‚Äô Tenure?
Wisconsin school teachers will lose
the job security given them under the
tenure law passed by the 1937 legislature
if a bill introduced by Assemblyman
Glenn H Jam es Republican
becomes a law
The bill would repeal the 1937 law
which provides th at teachers who have
served a five-year probationary period
in school cannot be discharged except
for inefficiency or misbehavior and
can demand a public hearing if they
are discharged
A test of the law which was a
source of much controversy in the
1937 legislature before it was passed
is now before the state supreme court
in the case of a teacher discharged be
cause of m arriage
U W Regents Bill
The present 14-member board of
regents of the University of Wisconsin
all appointed by form er governor
La Follette would be wiped out and
replaced by a new 9-member board
appointed by Governor Heil and ap
proved by the senate under a bill introduced
by Senator E J Roethe Re
publican
Present law allows the governor to
appoint the regents without senate
confirmation The board m ust contain
one member from each congressional
district and four members from the
state at large A t least two m ust be
women two farm ers and two manual
workers The state superintendent of
public instruction and the university
president who has a vote only in case
of a tie are ex-officio members of the
board Roethe‚Äôs bill contains no provisions
for district or occupational
membership
Though the present board members
were all appointed by La Follette A
C Backus Milwaukee whose term re cently
expired was reappointed by
Heil
To Reenact Reorganization
Four bills which would re-enact
state reorganization changes made by
Governor La Follette which were repealed
in blanket order by the senate
in its first week in session have been
introduced into the assembly and senate
S
enator Risser Madison Progressive
and Assemblyman Murray Mil
waukee Republican have proposed
measures in their respective houses
which would return the securities division
back to the state banking departm
ent
Three other bills in the assembly
would:
1 Return the jurisdiction of the
Wisconsin schools for the deaf and
blind from the state board of control
to the departm ent of public instruction
2 T ransfer the school of library
science from the free library commission
to the university board of regents
3 Remove the state and county
sanatoria from jurisdiction of the
board of control to the state board of
health
Farm ers Pay Promptly
Wisconsin farm ers who borrowed
money from the Farm Security Adm
inistration had repaid about 10 per
cent more than the am ount due on
loans at the end of 1938 reports Arlie
Mucks state FSA director
Almost two million dollars of the
seven million borrowed by 6895 farm
families in the state has been repaid
though only 1651751 was due December
31 1938 F an n ers borrowed
the money for livestock feed and
machinery so th at they could continue
farm ing
Loans have also been made to 26
farm tenants in designated counties
of the state so they could buy their
farm s Loans were for a 40-year
period a t 3 per cent interest and
were made under the year-old Bankhead-
Jones farm tenant act
Legislative Farm News
Local branches of the F arm ers‚Äô
Educational and Cooperative Equity
Union of Wisconsin have presented
resolutions to the legislature and
Governor Heil announcing th a t they
endorse the present seven man board
of the departm ent of agriculture and

th a t they believe Ralph Ammon present
director is especially well qualified
for his position
Both houses of the legislature have

The new ‚ÄúWisconsin Agriculture‚Äù
Bulletin No 188 is now available to
those who are interested in the sta te‚Äôs
largest industry‚farm ing According
to the Crop Reporting Service of
the Wisconsin and United States Departm
ents of Agriculture here are
some of the many facts about Shawano
county which will be found in this
economic summary of Wisconsin ag riculture
About 64 percent of the land in
Shawano county is used for farming
With about 4108 farm s in the county
the total am ount of land in farm s is
471257 acres According to the last
census the value of the land and
buildings was more than 24919158
Estim ates show there are about
63000 head of cattle in the county of
which about 44800 are milk cows
The farm value of the dairy herds in
the county on January 1 1938 was
2912000 Farm s in the county produce
about 236 million pounds of milk
annually
In order to feed the livestock farm ers
in the county raise large quantities
of feed crops E stim ates show
th at the average acreages of some of
the feed crops for the 20 years 1917-
36 were 32618 acres of corn 41486
acres of oats 9459 acres of barley
and 56470 acres of tame hay
About 9 percent of the farm s in
Shawano county are operated by
tenants Of the 91 percent of the
farm s operated by the owners 65 percent
are mortgaged The study of
farm m ortgage debt on these owneroperated
farm s in the county shows
that it is about 47 percent of the total
value of the farms

FORTY-SIXTH YEAR W ITTENBERG SHAW ANO COUNTY WISCONSIN THURSDAY FEBRUARY 2 1939 NUMBER 12
C ar License Reprieve
Wisconsin car owners need have no
fear of arre st for driving: with the old
1938 license plates‚a t least not until
a fte r March 15
The first bill signed by Governor
Julius P Heil allows car owners an
extra month and 15 days for payment
of license fees Car licenses prior to
the action of the legislature and Govrnor
were due February 1
Since 1931 when the legislature
recommended in special session that
officials be lenient for a month or two
in enforcing auto license laws each
succeeding legislature has granted additional
time for the payment of auto
taxes In the even numbered years
when the legislature has not been in
session license date extensions have
been made by order of the Governor
and the secretary of state
It is possible th a t the 1939 legislature
may reduce the cost of auto licenses
for 1940 An im portant plank
in the Republican platform last November
bills have already been introduced
which would reduce fees Governor
Heil in an address before the
annual state road school in Milwaukee
last week pointed out that he favors a
reduction of fees especially for the
sm aller cars He believes that such
reduction would bring out on to the
roads the many cars now laid up and
th at the loss of the fees themselves
would be made up many times by the
increase in sums returned to the state
in gasoline taxes
The Governor also informed listeners
at the road school th at some diversion
of gasoline taxes would be necessary
He explained th at without the
tran sfer of highway funds for other
purposes some other form of taxation
would be necessary to cover the expenses
of the state
A bill before the senate by Senator
Yindra of Manitowoc would place
highway money in a special fund and
make illegal the use of such money
for any purpose other than highway
construction or improvement
Repeal Teachers‚Äô Tenure?
Wisconsin school teachers will lose
the job security given them under the
tenure law passed by the 1937 legislature
if a bill introduced by Assemblyman
Glenn H Jam es Republican
becomes a law
The bill would repeal the 1937 law
which provides th a t teachers who have
served a five-year probationary period
in school cannot be discharged except
fo r inefficiency or misbehavior and
can demand a public hearing if they
are discharged
A test of the law which was a
source of much controversy in the
1937 legislature before it was passed
is now before the state supreme court
in the case of a teacher discharged because
of marriage
U W Regents Bill
The present 14-member board of
regents of the University of Wisconsin
all appointed by form er governor
La Follette would be wiped out and
replaced by a new 9-member board
appointed by Governor Heil and ap proved
by the senate under a bill introduced
by Senator E J Roethe Republican
Present law allows the governor to
appoint the regents without senate
confirmation The board must contain
one member from each congressional
d istrict and four members from the
sta te at large At least two m ust be
women two farm ers and two manual
workers The state superintendent of
public instruction and the university
president who has a vote only in case
of a tie are ex-officio members of the
board Roethe‚Äôs bill contains no provisions
for district or occupational
membership
Though the present board members
were all appointed by La Follette A
C Backus Milwaukee whose term recently
expired was reappointed by
Heil
To Reenact Reorganization
Four bills which would re-enact
sta te reorganization changes made by
Governor La Follette which were repealed
in blanket order by the senate
in its first week in session have been
introduced into the assembly and senate
S
enator Risser Madison Progressive
and Assemblyman Murray Milwaukee
Republican have proposed
m easures in their respective houses
which would return the securities division
back to the state banking departm
ent
Three other bills in the assembly
would:
1 Return the jurisdiction of the
Wisconsin schools for the deaf and
blind from the state board of control
to the departm ent of public instruction
2 T ransfer the school of library
science from the free library commission
to the university board of regents
3 Remove the sta te and county
sanatoria from jurisdiction of the
board of control to the sta te board of
health
Farm ers Pay Promptly
Wisconsin farm ers who borrowed
money from the Farm Security Adm
inistration had repaid about 10 per
cent more than the am ount due on
loans a t the end of 1938 reports Arlie
Mucks sta te FSA director
Almost two million dollars of the
seven million borrowed by 6895 farm
families in the state has been repaid
though only 1651751 was due December
31 1938 Farm ers borrowed
the money for livestock feed and
machinery so th at they could continue
farm ing
Loans have also been made to 26
farm tenants in designated counties
of the sta te so they could buy their
farms Loans were for a 40-year
period a t 3 per cent interest and
were made under the year-old Bankhead-
Jones farm tenant act
Legislative Farm New¬ß
Local branches of the F arm ers‚Äô
Educational and Cooperative Equity
Union of Wisconsin have presented
resolutions to the legislature and
Governor Heil announcing th at they
endorse the present seven man board
of the departm ent of agriculture and
m arkets They also state in resolution
th at they believe Ralph Ammon present
director is especially well qualified
for his position
Both houses of the legislature have
a bill which would abolish the present
seven man board set up another of
Governor La Follette‚Äôs reorganization
measures and return the three man
commission
A bill by Assemblyman Daugs F ort
Atkinson would also repeal the de-

The new ‚ÄúWisconsin Agriculture‚Äù
Bulletin No 188 ia now available to
those who are interested in the state‚Äôs
largest industry‚farming According
to the Crop Reporting Service of
the Wisconsin and United States Departm
ents of Agriculture here are
some of the many facts about Shawano
county which will be found in this
economic summary of Wisconsin agriculture
About 64 percent of the land in
Shawano county is used for farming
With about 4108 farm s in the county
the ttal amount of land in farms is
471267 acres According to the last
census the value of the land and
buildings was more than 24919158
Estim ates show there are about
63000 head of cattle in the county of
which about 44800 are milk cows
The farm value of the dairy herds in
the county on January 1 1938 was
2912000 Farms in the county produce
about 236 million pounds of milk
annually
In order to feed the livestock farm ers
in the county raise large quantities
of feed crops Estim ates show
th at the average acreages of some of
the feed crops for the 20 years 1917-
36 were 32618 acres of corn 41486
acres of oats 9459 acres of barley
and 56470 acres of tame hay
About 9 percent of the farm s in
Shawano county are operated by
tenants Of the 91 percent of the
farm s operated by the owners 65 percent
are mortgaged The study of
farm m ortgage debt on these owneroperated
farm s in the county shows

Mr Lippmann staled the case
6quare-m ile tra c t has belonged to
the U S since 1898 lately becom ing
a potentially im portant base for
Pacific com m ercial aviation But
since Ja p an began flashing her
fangs G uam has become even m ore
im portant as an outpost to protect
A m erica‚Äôs back door The need for
such an outpost is illustrated by J a pan‚Äôs
illegal fortification of nearby
m andated Caroline and M arianne
islands
Official W ashington thinks Ja p a n
is using outlaw tactics in her Chinese
invasion her illegal fortifications
and‚of less im portance to the
U S‚by threatening to fish R ussian

an item of 44000000 w as listed for
naval air and subm arine bases Now
this has been boosted to 65000000
and 5000000 of the sum would be
authorized at G uam for deepening
the harbor m aking landing fields
and enlarging m arine barracks
This drew from Ja p a n exactly the
protest W ashington expected and
wanted When Tokyo objected th at
G uam ‚Äôs fortification would be an aggressive
move the White House
com m ented th a t Columnist W alter
L ippm anns rem ark s ju st about fitted
the picture: ‚Äú Congress should
authorize the fortification of Guam 
and then the sta te departm ent
should invite the Jap an ese to discuss
the question under Article XIX
of the Washington treaty (nine-power
pact guaranteeing C hinas open
door) In this discussion we could
say to the Jap an ese if they do not
wish Guam to be fortified they
m ight return to the treaty by dism
antling fortifications in the m andated
islands‚Äù
P resident Roosevelt has rem ained
free of the controversy by pointing

Medicine
Until the New Deal socialized
[ medicine received little publicity
j L ast spring P resident Roosevelt appointed
an inter-departm ental com m
ittee to investigate health program
s this group subsequently
clashing with the A m erican Medical
association and bringing to a head
monopoly charges now pending
against the association Predictions
are th at the U S will inaugurate
its com prehensive public health program
before the ju stice dep artm en t
gets around to hearing A M A‚Äôs
case thereby lessening the value of
this proceeding The prediction is
bearing fruit in P re sid en t Roosev
elts long range health program
just presented to congress
The p rogram : Beginning im m ediately
federal-state expenditures
would be increased to 850000000
annually by 1949 Funds would go
generally to help poor people re ceive
m edical and hospital care to
establish clinics encourage vaccinations
develop m atern al and child
w elfare clinics and stim u late disease-
control m easures
Tream ry
In 1934 congress gave P resident
Roosevelt two broad m onetary powe
rs Under one he could reduce
the dollar‚Äôs gold content by 50 per
cent though since 1934 the ra te ha¬ª
been 59 06 per cent U nder the
o ther power the President created
a currency stabilization fund with
increm ent accruing from the govern
m en t‚Äôs revaluation of gold holdings
Originally estim ated at
2000000000 the fund is used to
protect the d o llars value on international
exchange preventing undue
fluctuations
Both powers expire June 30 and
the White House has already asked
th at they be renew ed until the current
presidential term expires Ja n uary
15 1941 Although law m akers
consider neither g rant dangerous
the m ere fact th a t gold devaluation
and the stabilization fund a re ‚Äú powe
rs ‚Äù is enough to m ake this y e a r‚Äôs
flery-eyed congress balk
Biggest opposition will grow out
of the tre a su ry ‚Äôs refusal to divulge
even the size of the stabilization
fund the two-billion-dollar figure being
only a guess Though softened
by w ell-substantiated reports that
thc governm ent m ade about 6 000-
000 profit on the fund last year

Taxation
Two form er U S treasu ry secretaries
Andrew W Mellon and Ogden
L Mills condem ned the inequity
of tax exem pt federal state
and local bonds Since his ‚Äú soakthe-
rich‚Äù revenue proposal of 1935
President Roosevelt has fought tax
exem pt securities and one other unpopular
exem ption th at on federal
sta te and local em ployees‚Äô salaries
If these exem ptions could be abolished
the U S governm ent figures
it would net eventually 300000000
annually from governm ent securities
plus 16000000 from em ployees‚Äô
income taxes
One day before the P resid en t offered
this program to congress in
a special m essage he sent T reasury
U ndersecretary John W Hanes
to pave the way before a special
senate com m ittee Said Mr H anes:
‚Äú The tim e for action has com e‚Äù
The Constitution‚Äôs Sixteenth
am endm ent gives congress power to
‚Äú lay and collect taxes on incom es
from w hatever source deriv ed ‚Äù
therefore the adm inistration thinks
statutory enactm ent ra th e r than
constitutional am endm ent will suffice
L ater after congress has spoken
the courts can decide w hether
its action is constitutional Argued
Mr H anes:
Tax exem pt securities now perm
it m any large-incom e persons to
escape income taxes entirely therefore
they a re unfair The 65000-
000000 in tax exem pt securities now
outstanding (of which som e 50000-
000000 would be taxable) is so form
idable th a t it discourages investm
ent in private enterprises involving
risk Thus industry cannot compete
As for income tax exem ptions
the U S Suprem e court has
already set a precedent by ruling
th at salaries of such quazi-public
agencies as the P ort of New York
authority are subject to federal ta x ation
As m ight be expected sta te and
local groups jum ped into the fight
overnight Argued the Conference
of S tate Defense: Tax yield would
not approach the im m ediate tre a sury
estim ate of 70000000 a year
Moreover it would work hardship on
sta te s and m unicipalities by increasing
financing costs The statu to ry
procedure would be unconstitutional
Most im portant once congress‚Äô
power to tax income of sta te and local
securities has been established
a situation could arise in which congress
would attem p t to tax state

WASHINGTON‚A very strong
course of action is being urged on
P re sid en t R oosevelt with a view to
resisting the aggrandizations of G erm
any and Italy  particularly in
L atin A m erica though the course
recom m ended would eventually its
back ers believe bring about a collapse
of the F asc ist and Nazi r e gim
es and rem ove their perpetual
w ar sc a re in Europe
The first essen tial step of the proposed
pro g ram is for the United
S tates to be read y to fight if necessary
To this p a rt of the p rogram
the P resid en t h as yielded considerably
as shown in his preparedness
m essage to congress
The next step not to be taken until
after the U nited S tates is so
strong th a t th is next move would
not provoke a w‚Äôar would be to
s ta rt w‚Äôh a t would am ount to a tra d e
war on the to talitarian states This
would m ean the selling of A m erican
goods a t a loss when our own wage
and labor conditions are considered
and it would involve perm itting paym
ent for these goods by taking the
exports of the nations to the south
of us
One of the advocates of this plan
illu strated the idea with M exican
oil
‚Äò‚ÄòI think‚Äô he said  th a t the Mexican
governm ent has the right to
take over foreign-owned oil wells
T hat is within their power Of
course they should pay us for the
p roperty so taken But let‚Äôs conside
r w hat is probably going to happen
unless we do a little strong-arm
work so to speak Mexico will have
to sell th a t oil to G erm any Italy
and Ja p an  It will take in paym
ent for th a t oil the goods m ade by
w hat according to our labor conditions
is virtu ally slave labor
Must Sell Goods Cheaper
Than Totalitarian States
‚Äú Now we sim ply cannot afford to
let th a t happen It will m ean a
strengthening of Ja p a n  Italy and
G erm any w hich we cannot contem p
late w‚Äôith equanim ity if we are
hopeful for world peace As a m a tte
r of fact the progress of this sort
of thing will eventually prevent us
from either m aintaining our standard
s of living or m aintaining peace
no m a tte r how m uch we m ay be
willing to endure in o rder to preserve
peace T here will com e a
tim e when it will be im possible i
‚Äú So we m ust buy th a t M exican j
; oil and we m ust pay for it with ;
goods sold as cheaply or m ore
cheaply than Ja p an  Italy and G erm
any can deliver them 
‚Äú We m ust do th a t every tim e anything
of the so rt happens Does any
: one believe th at other big invest-
I m ents in L atin A m erica will continue
to be safe when every politi-
| cian south of Mexico sees th a t couni
try getting aw ay w ith it?
‚Äú But the im portant thing for us is
to prevent th a t sort of thing th re a tening
our future by preventing the
to talitarian sta te s from taking adv
antage of it
‚Äú We should have a thorough understanding
with F ra n ce and G reat
B ritain and the other dem ocracies
and we should go after world tra d e
with a big stick To do th a t we
m u st be arm ed sufficiently to p revent
the possibility of trouble We
m ust subsidize exports to a slightly
g re a te r extent than G erm any or Italy
or Japan And we m ust buy
the products of these countries
‚Äú It will cost us a lot of money but
it will be cheap in the long run And
the cost will be offset to a su rprising
extent by the stepping up of
production in this country which
will relieve unem ploym ent‚Äô
A rm y and Navy Officers
Long Urged Preparedness
In dem anding m ore appropriations
for p reparedness both arm y
and navy officers are m erely voicing
publicly w hat they have known
and been saying p rivately for six
years
Starvation of the arm y and navy
so far as new m aterial is concerned
began in the Hoover adm inistration
when poor business cut tax retu rn s
and pinched the federal exchequer
This has gone on until with little or
no purchasing of new arm s new
guns new am m unition and even
new explosives there developed a
situation which high officials adm it
m ight easily have been trag ic had
som e em ergency arisen under
which the arm y and navy would
have had to fight
The sim plest illustration is th at
explosives d eteriorate This is true
despite the occasional trag ic accident
when some old shell explodes
as when it is plowed into on a
1 battlefield But long range firing by
i big guns is a m a tte r of infinite cal-
I culation When naval or coast defense
gunners a re trying to hit a
hostile ship 10 or m ore m iles aw ay
the quality of the explosive th a t propels
the shell they fire is of tre m
endous im portance
Incidentally it is usually the explosive
in a ‚Äú dud‚Äù shell th a t hurts
som eone in an accident T his is
not the explosive th a t propelled that
shell It is the ch arg e th a t should
have detonated when the shell hit
its m ark  T his is also an im portant
ch arg e of course but when it com es
to hitting the enem y in battle it is
the propelling c h arg e th a t is vital
A slight d eterio ratio n could m ake a
difference of a half a m ile m ore or
less in w here the shell landed
S u p p ly o f Explosives Is
Allow ed to Grow Stale
It would easily m ake the difference
betw een winning o r losing an
im p o rtan t naval battle P resent-day
naval strateg y gives the victory to
the first fleet to land a salvo on the
ta rg e t T hat is the reason thc sup
erior optical instrum ents of the
G erm an s in the World w ar m ade
th e ir otherw ise inferior fleet such a
m en ace‚which m ade the losses of
the B ritish so heavy a t Ju tlan d 
Not only has the explosives supply
of the United S tates a rm y and
navy been allowed to grow sta le
and risk its being incalculable for
ac c u ra te firing in battle but a ctu ally
to this day th e re is not an adequate
factory source for its supply
M achinery is now in p reparation
for such a supply and the fact th a t
it is m ak es an e x trao rd in ary rev elation
of the d e sp era te n atu re of
the picture About a y e a r ago this
m achinery w as ordered without the
sanction of congress and w ithout
publicity at a cost of 3300000
The o rd ers w ere m ade possible by
a p riv ate individual who g u a ra n teed
the orders In short he would
have been obliged eith er to take
o ver the m achinery him self or to
lose his money if congress should
not la te r legalize the operation
B ut the am azing p a rt of the whole
story is th a t these needs w ere re a lized
in 1933 and th a t certain arm y
officers obtained en actm en t by congress
in the first 4400000000 re lief
bill (w hich included NRA) for
th e m echanization and m otorization
of the arm y B ut this effort w as

not to lend them any m ore money

CH A PTER IV‚Continued
- 11-
Rex left K neeland a t his office and
added the ro ad ster to the im pressive
collection in the facto ry ‚Äôs parking
space A pparently every em ployee
of the K neeland C om pany rode luxuriously
to work in his own autom obile
and m any of the c a rs w ere
m ore expensive than th e president‚Äôs
Rex w as now free to follow his
own plans He hustled to the n earest
telephone booth W hat he w anted
w as the nam e and ad d ress of a
fingerprint e x p ert not associated
w ith police activities He had no
idea how to get it He finally called
up the editor of an engineering m agazine
to which he subscribed The
editor had not the inform ation he
w anted and explained th a t it w as
not in his line; but he referred the
questioner to som eone who could
give it Rex called up this authority
and got an e x p e rt‚Äô address
W ithout leaving the booth he called
up the la tte r‚Äôs telephone num ber It
w as not yet ten o‚Äôclock The fingerp
rint m an w as in his office Hale
got him on the w ire and asked for
an appointm ent Yes he could have
one alm ost a t once‚say at half
p a s t ten The factory w as downtown
n ear the E a st R iver By the
subw ay it would tak e Rex fifteen
m inutes to get to the fingerprint
bureau
His next step m ust be to get in
touch w ith som e friends or acquaintan
ces who knew Ainsw orth a lot
better than he him self did He
racked his brains for nam es of associates
in Ith aca who had later
settled in New York He finally had
a list of three One of these w as
not in the telephone book The second
whose New York office he
prom ptly reached by telephone w as
in South A m erica Gloomily he put
in a call for the th ird m an a m an
he really knew well and had liked a
lot ih Ithaca He had a bit of luck
He did not expect to find George
Stuyvesant in town at this season
But yes a clerk said Mr Stuyvesa
n t w as in town‚though not yet
in his office
As he rode uptown in the subway
express Rex considered his
problem s He has discovered that
F red erick Ainsw orth had an offlct
on E a st Forty-second Street He
would visit it but w here would th at
get him ? Ainsw orth was devoting
little or no tim e to his professional
in terests these days even if he had
any His office m ight ba closed
Hale could find out about that at
least Then w hat would he do?
S tart an effort to learn som ething
about C raig‚Äôs in tim ate affairs T hat
effort m ight be even m ore futile
Ainsw orth w as s t least in H ale‚Äôs
own line of work Sooner or later
he could find out a good deal about
the fellow‚Äôs standing and achievem
ents tf any But C raig was su rrounded
by the ethical wall th at
protects a doctcr H ale already
knew from H erb ert K neeland w here
he young p sy c h iatrist had got his
training He had a good record
H ale had secured introductions from
the Chicago psyt iia trist to two New
York m en high in h e profession He
could ask som e searching questions
but he thought he knew pretty m uch
w hat resu lts he wouil get P erfu n ctory
and cautious answ ers A bright
fellow C raig well trained and am bitious
Giving m ost of his tim e to
resea rch  Too absorbed in his job
lo go about m uch Not a good m ixe
r Yes H ale knew all these anr
wers in advance Ainsworth knew
a lot about Craig and Ainsworth
would talk till the bell rang But
how m uch th a t Ainsw orth said could
one believe?
Hale entered the ‚Äú b u reau ‚Äù with a
brow corrugated by c a re He was
‚Ä¢ a his way His fortnight had been
a fair prep aratio n for the rest of
the journey But he had to have
the real background of those fellows
before he could hope to understand
th eir presen t activities How
w as he to get it?
The ‚Äú b u reau ‚Äù was a m ere hole in
the w all‚a nine by eleven office in
the re a r of a photographer‚Äôs studio
It had a private entrance A phlegm
atic young m an seated a t a battered
table-desk took H ale‚Äôs envelope
ex tracted the cards sheets
and sketches from it with a pair of
pincers and regarded the exhibit
without interest
‚Äú When do you w ant th ese?‚Äù he
asked
‚Äú In five minutes
The young m a n ‚Äôs phlegm atic featu
re s did not relax
‚Äú You can have ‚Äôem tomorrow
m orning We have other custom ers
too‚Äù
‚Äú I ‚Äôm glad to h ear that I ‚Äôve
m arked those exhibits by num bers
only T h a t‚Äôs all right isn‚Äôt it? ‚Äù
Y ep ‚Äù
‚Äú Do I have to leave m y own nam e
and ad d re ss? ‚Äù
‚Äú No T his is private business
You won‚Äôt have any trouble with
the police‚Äô
H ale laughed and the young m an‚Äôs
face softened a trifle He m ust have
been in his th irties but his eyes
looked as old as the etern al hills
He restored the exhibits to the envelope
threw the envelope into a
long d raw er under the battered ta ble
top and dropped the custom er
from his m ind
‚Ä¢T il call for the p rin ts about ten
tom orrow m orning‚Äù H ale said as
he d eparted
‚Äú O K ‚Äù
T here w as a public telephone in
the m ain hall of the building Hale
called Stuyvesant again ju st for
luck and got a heart-w arm ing response
Yes Mr Stuyvesant was
now a t his desk The next m inute
he heard his form er classm ate‚Äôs
p leasant voice
‚Äú Rex H ale? Why hello old man
T hree rousing cheers! I thought you
w ere in E u ro p e‚Äù
T m ju st back I ‚Äôm in town for
a day or two Can you lunch with
m e this noon?
T here w as only an in stan t‚Äôs hesitation
at the other end of the instrum
ent Then S tuyvesant‚Äôs pleasant
voice again
‚Äú I ‚Äôll m ake it though the calend
a r ‚Äôs p retty full What tim e and
where?
‚Äú At M axim ‚Äôs any tim e you sa y ‚Äù
‚Äú One o‚Äôclock then Is th a t all
rig h t? ‚Äù
‚Äú T h at‚Äôs fine I ‚Äôll be th ere a bit
ahead and reserv e a table Look for
m e in the m ain room ‚Äô
‚Äú All right It will be g reat to
see you ag ain ‚Äù
S tuyvesant‚Äôs voice w as w arm and
buoyantly friendly Stuyvesant had
been one of H ale‚Äôs chum s a t college
It w as ungrateful of him  Rex reflected
to have forgotten that
He m ade two m ore telephone appointm
ents and killed an hour by
visiting the building th a t housed
Ainsw orth‚Äôs office When he reached
the office itself he could only look at
it respectfully from the outside It
w as obviously a single room  in the
re a r of the fourth floor Ainsworth
w as still in possession of it His
nam e w as on the door and on the
list of ten an ts printed on the bulletin
board in the m ain hall But
as Hale had expected the office itself
seem ed deserted The door was
locked He discovered th at by try ing
it T here w as no light visible
through the keyhole The location
suggested th a t it would be a dark office
dependent on electricity
H ale got the inform ation he needed
from the colored elevator operator
No Mr Ainsw orth w asn‚Äôt in
He didn‚Äôt com e to his office very
often this sum m er When he w asn‚Äôt
there the office w as closed L ast
w inter he had been th ere a good
deal and had a girl se cre ta ry three
days a week T hat stopped in April
The op erato r thought things m ust
be pretty dull with Mr Ainsworth
Rex gave the m an half a dollar and
left the elevator feeling uncom fortable
T his business of prying into
ano th er‚Äôs affairs‚
He w ent to a library w here he got
a m edical directory and looked up
C raig‚Äôs record as well as the records
of the m en to whom he had
letters It w as a good one exactly
as young Kneeland had given
it The girl a t the loan desk was
not busy and Hale asked h er what
m en she considered the leading psych
iatrists in New York He was
curious to know w hether the two
men he w as to see th at afternoon
would be on her list Also he m ight
have to consult others if these men
proved too close-m outhed She w as
ra th e r vague about psychiatrists
She consulted som eone else in the
lib ra ry and gave Hale the nam es
of three m en One of them  Doctor
Gordon D ew ar was pleasantly fam
iliar H ale w as to see him at
half p ast three He reflected with a
grin th a t in these inquiries he him self
w as leaving a trail behind him
as sharply defined as th at of a tra c tor
acro ss a field T hat was all
right how ever No one w as trailing
him 
It w as a t precisely this point that
he turned and saw Ainsw orth reading
quietly a t a table behind him
He stiffened and sta red  This
seem ed m ore than coincidence
Ainsworth m ight have followed him
P erh ap s he had com e in on the
train  had hurried to the factory
knowing th a t K neeland m ust be
dropped there and had subsequently
and cleverly followed H ale‚Äôs progress
to the telephone booths the fing
erprint bureau and to his own office
But had he? How had he m anaged
to keep out of sight? Easily
enough perhaps He wouldn‚Äôt get
anything a t the fingerprint bureau
except the suspicion th at fingerprints
w ere being m ade But it
would be a sim ple m atter for him
to enter his own office building
afte r Hale had left it and to learn
from the elevator o perator what
questions if any the red-headed
young m an in the gray suit had
asked Hale set his teeth He w asn‚Äôt
su re of any of these things but he
would find out
He strode over to A insw orth‚Äôs ta ble
and greeted him with breezy
cordiality Ainsw orth looked up with
a sta rt The s ta rt w as well done
The fellow actually flushed a little
H ale rem em b ered the old and unexpected
tric k Ainsworth had of
flushing when taken unaw ares It
w as p art of the personal sensitiveness
th at w as so out of keeping
with his b ru tal frankness toward
o ther men
‚Äú Hello! I didn‚Äôt expect to find you
h e re ‚Äù H ale said He had been relieved
by th a t flush He w as further
relieved by A insw orth‚Äôs obvious annoyance
over the encounter
‚Äú Nor I you‚Äù Ainsworth said curtly-
‚Äú I thought you w ere a gentlem an
of leisure this su m m er‚Äù
‚Äú Like yourself?‚Äù
‚Äú Oh I ‚Äôm ju st a poor w retch th a t‚Äôs
trying to patch him self up a fte r a
tussle with the u n d ertak er‚Äù
‚Äú You look it Ainsworth scoffed
But his m anner softened H ale was
m ore friendly this m orning than he
had yet showrn him self and Ainsw
orth had his m om ents of loneliness
in an unappreciative world
‚Äú It w asn‚Äôt the day I ‚Äôd choose for
an excursion into tow n‚Äù he grum bled
‚Äú I had a hurry call this m orning
from a m iserly old ass who gave
m e a two hundred doilar job last
spring and seem s to think it bought
m y tim e for a year I ‚Äôve been
spending the m orning with him
H e‚Äôs dallying now with the thought
of giving m e a hundred dollar job
but I don‚Äôt d a re to hope he‚Äôll work
him self up to it‚Äù Ainsw‚Äôorth spoke
with a gloom th at w as too genuine
to be questioned Hale dropped into
a chair facing him
‚Äú I take it business isn‚Äôt booming‚Äù
he com m ented
‚Äú You don‚Äôt know anything y et‚Äù
Ainsworth confirm ed bitterly ‚Äú Wait
till you‚Äôve observed your native land
a few m onths H owever one m ust
eat How about lunching tog eth er?‚Äù
‚Äú Sorry but I‚Äôm booked T h ats
w hat I ‚Äôm in town for Are you sta y ing
in town a day or two? We m ight
dine tonight or lunch tom orrow ‚Äù
Hale was alm ost reg rettin g his
luncheon engagem ent Ainsworth in
this black mood would be worth
studying and listening to But probably
it was m erely a tem porary
mood
‚Äú No I ‚Äôm taking the four-thirty
Y oure staying over then?‚Äù
‚Äú Y es‚Äù Hale decided ‚Äú till tom orrow
anyway Will you tell Miss
H osanna I‚Äôll be there for din n er?‚Äù
‚Äú Yep So long‚Äù
Ainsworth didn‚Äôt even tu rn his
head as Hale left him He had a
pile of m edical books on the tabla
before him and was glancing over
one of them without interest H ala
bustled to M axim ‚Äôs to m eet Stuyvesant
He engaged his table and
w aited for his guest fifteen m inutes
He w as not surprised when
th a t engaging young m an finally ap peared
to see that he had put on
ten or fifteen pounds Stuyvesant
had alw ays been fond of the fleshpots

Over their cocktails they exchanged
the inevitable questions
and answ ers of their reunion Then
Hale said casually as their luncheon
began ‚Äú I ‚Äôve run into Ainsworth
since I cam e back T h at‚Äôs a coincidence
isn‚Äôt it? T here a re n ‚Äôt so
m any Ith aca men of our day in
New York th a t 1 expect to m eet
them bustling about here Have you
been seeing anything of Ainsw
orth?‚Äù
Stuyvesant grim aced at the introduction
of Ainsw orth‚Äôs nam e T hat
slight curve of his full lips w as eloquent
testim ony of what he thought
of his form er associate But he
followed his host‚Äôs conversational
lead
‚Äú I certainly don‚Äôt see m uch of
Ainsworth and 1 don‚Äôt want to I
never liked him I hear of him occasionally
and 1 m eet him from
tim e to tim e during the winter He
seem s to go about a lot then
‚Äú Socially you m ean‚Äù 
‚Äú Yes He‚Äôs a born New Yorker
you know He com es of a good
fam ily He‚Äôs about the last limb

Rex suddenly rem em bered that
Stuyvesant him self w as also a ‚Äú born

T hat had never seem ed im portant
when they were a t Ithaca It was

‚Äú I didn‚Äôt know th a t‚Äù Hale said
slowly ‚Äú In fact I didn‚Äôt know anything

‚Äú Only a few hundred a y e a r left

bring you ideas for new styles that

as they can be! You can
be the first in your se t to
flaunt them  and so econom ically
if you m ake them at home choosing
the fabrics yourself You don‚Äôt

new m ake yourself the

fashion rings out the m essage
of the im portance of color for

destined to prove a dram atic

m idseason with handsom e
woolens th a t a re being tailored
alluringly into sm a rt suits and
ensem bles also topcoats as
attractiv e as ere the light of
fashion shown upon
If you are im patient to don color
you do not have to wait for the
actual a rriv al of spring neither are
you called upon to travel to sunny
clim es to w ear one of the new bright
woolen outfits for at this very m om
ent fashion-alert women are acquiring
tailleurs of flashing dashing
gay wool w eaves th at forecast
the color-glory of suits ensem bles
d resses and coats th at will enliven
the style scene throughout the com ing
m onths
E arly spring tweeds ‚Äú say it‚Äù irresistibly
via plaids and strip es th at
are superbly colorful Playing up
bright woolens in trios is one way
of showing enthusiasm for the new
novelty stripes plaids and checks
In such instances a stripe a plaid
or check and a plain are so in terrelated
in color values as to m ake
a stunning costum e such as any
lady of fashion m ight covet
The tailored suit of plaid woolen
in the foreground of our illustration
in softest shades of rose and green
with wool jersey blouse of dusty
pink would sound a trium phant high
coloratura note under a fur coat in
any clim e where the th erm om eter
persists in registering low or with
light accessories it will prove ideal
on a southern cruise
From P aris com es the dram atic
sport ensem ble shown to the left in
the group Lucien Lelong creates
this style-significant costum e of m ulticolored
stripe tweed The blouse
is in green jersey enhanced with a
brilliant studded belt
The oncoming rush for plaided or
striped woolens is modishly told in
the two attractiv e m odels shown in
the background C rossbar plaid in
blue and white im ported tweed
m akes the topcoat and jacket for
the costum e show‚Äôn to the left with
m atching blue monotone skirt
Bright yellow red blue and a natural
beige blend harm oniously in
the beautiful plaid topcoat of im ported
tweed at the right It is lined
with m atching blue silk crepe
The task th at fashion sets before
the designer of sm a rt wool outfits
for spring is to so inter-relate colors
th at combined m ake a harmonious
individualized entity of their own j
It is not beyond the bonds of good
ta s te to com bine a stripe a plaid
and a plain In fact the working ol
novelty woolens in trios is one oI
the sm a rtest new est moves among
designers who notably lead in costum
e art
The dom inant note in early spring
fashioning is as it has been for
some tim e past the contrast jack et
and sk irt two-piece suit The
stripes and plaids and nubby wool
w eaves th a t go to m ake up these
youthful suits are m ore fascinating
than ever In stylizing these popular
num bers designers are making
a big play on pockets Sometimes
the front of the jack et is fairly pias
tered with innum erable decorative
as well as useful pockets
Newest am ong woolens in use foi
spring are diagonal stripe effects
such as a gray wool with wide white
strip es running diagonally across
Prospects are th at we will be see

For the Kids
Do you remember the old jingle j
‚Ä¢Jack Sprat which tells us how the
old Europeans used to eat A platter
was set in the middle of the table
and the family dipped into the com- i
mon dish You may never h av e 1
thought of that old rhyme as a vignette
of history‚Äù but it really is !
Well here‚Äôs how some of our teachers i
give ‚ÄúJack S prat‚Äù :
‚Ä¢Jack Sprat was strong and fat
For he drank milk and cream
Ate vegetables and lots of bread
And left his plate quite clean
They forget he had a wife‚Maybe
because most teachers are single or J
are they?
#  
Even our good old ‚Äú Pat-a-cake‚Äù has
been changed to:
Patties clean patties clean my
little man
Rub them and scrub them as fast
as you can
Soap them and soap them and dry
them quite well
For hark! you can hear the old
dinner bell
  
Did you ever learn the Mother
Goose rhyme ‚Äú I saw a ship a-sailing‚Äù
? What do you think of this
version ?
‚ÄúI saw a ship a-sailing
A-sailing on the sea
And oh but it was laden
With children good to see!
Strong arms that held the sails
tight
Red cheeks that laughed at cold
And every child upon it
Was worth his weight in gold‚Äù
  #
And now we‚Äôll close with the plea
that in these snappy winter days you
do what your Doctor wise advised:
There was a man in our town
He was a Doctor wise   
Who wanted folks to keep quite well
And so he did advise   
Fresh air good food and lots of
sleep
With m erry times each day   
And all the folks who followed him
Were happy well and gay

Small Farms Given
Options in 1939 AAA
Farm FVoprram
The 1039 AAA Farm Program
offers a special option to the farm er
whose total soil-depleting allotment is i
less than 20 acres
O B Hagen chairman of the
Shawano County Agricultural Con-
servatjon Committee has just re
ceived notification of this change in
the 1930 farm program as compared
to the 1938 program
UnrTer this provision a farm er
with a total soil-depleting allotment
of 20 acres or less has the option of
having his farm considered a nongeneral-
allotm ent farm explains Mr
Hagen In this case if he stays w ithin
his special crop allotments he will
receive according to Washington an nouncement
the payments based on
these allotments but may increase the
acreage of his general crops to bring
his total soil-depleting acreage up to
20 acres without deductions If he
carried out a certain number of additional
soil-building practices he may
eain the same maximum payment
‚Äú Farm ers will find that it is more
flexible and offers more advantages
than the 1938 program concludes
the county chairman

CT CAN‚ÄôT understand it‚Äù wailed a
 stupid m other to m e ‚Äú Jenny is
so plain and her two sisters a re so
beautiful! I only hope som e m an
will see som ething in her and m arry
her I ‚Äôll have no trouble getting the
other two m arried but Jenny is going
to be a p roblem !‚Äù
Jenny heard her m other and she
ju st laughed ‚Äú I t‚Äôs too bad I am so
plain‚Äù she said ‚Äú and if no m an
will m a rry m e when I grow up I‚Äôll
be a n u rse !‚Äù Jenny w as 15 then
Five y e a rs later I saw Jenny
again H er m other had w ritten th at
Jenny w as to be m arried and her
two p retty sisters (still not m a rried!)
w ere to attend her I w as
am azed a t this turn of events
When I stepped off the train there
w as Jenny with frank lovely eyes
sm iling m e a welcome Her rath er
ang u lar figure was becomingly a ttired
in a sim ply cut sports frock
and her long straig h t black hair had
been cut and waved Now short
cu rls haloed her plain face giving
it the m ost fascinating piquant expression
F rom th a t first m om ent it w as
fun to be with Jenny to listen to her
w edding plans to m eet her young
friends and to w atch her easy delightful
poise ‚Äú The Ugly Ducklings
certainly m ade good‚Äù I m urm
ured and w as curious to know
w hat she had done during those five
intervening years
It seem s th a t at an early age
Jenny realized th at beaux and p a rties
and indulgence of whim s w ere
not going to be hers easily because
she lacked the beauty her sisters
had so she stru ck out for a life of
her own and went to college T here
she co n centrated on school affairs
a s ardently as on her studies and
soon won an enviable place in the
h earts of her classm ates Not expecting
m uch from life without effort
she m atu red into an unselfish
thoughtful person and through
study quite unconsciously developed
her personality It w as at a

No the girl over 30 who has let
herself down m ust pick herself up

She m ust think she is needed
th at she is good at her work th a t

Then she m ust m ake herself ju st as

within her m eans
Any girl can exercise herself back
to health put color in her cheeks
and a sp ark le in her eyes She can
pam p er h er hair by brushing sham pooing

neatly m ended and if her funds are

and m ake him feel she is capable

The Ise of F ace Pow der
F ace powder is perhaps w om an‚Äôs
oldest beauty aid In E gypt China
and Ja p a n powders have been used
for centuries Rice sta rc h  clay
bism uth and almond m eal w ere toilet
prerequisites before the days of
C leopatra
A high grade powder is a- m anysided
blessing It p rotects the skin
again st strong sunlight h arsh winds
and atm ospheric dust
The woman who knows her beauty
rules never grinds pow der into the
pores She pats it on lightly s ta rting
under the chin and not on the
nose as w as the old-tim e custom 
After its application she taps her
face lightly with the finger tips T hat
tends to m ake the pow der stick
It‚Äôs im portant to be fastidious
about the powder pad since germ s
lurk on even a clean skin Absorbent
cotton is m ore sa n ita ry  though
it doesnt spread the powder as nicely
as lam bs wool Rouge pads are
frowned upon because they a re usually
given such long service
Many of todays pow ders contain !
sta rc h talcum  also oxide of zinc j
which is an excellent antiseptic To |
help powders to hold on lotions are
used some being com pounded of
ste a ra te of zinc and a bland oil !
They should be rubbed into the flesh j
until they disappear as you would
with a vanishing cream 
P assen g ers began to show signs of uneasiness
been through this tunnel and had never given it a second thought
But m any a re the thoughts M arcella has given th a t doggone
tunnel since
She boarded the tra in for Ridgefield P a rk and found seats in
the next to the last coach The tra in sta rted  and entered the
tunnel as usual It w as about half way through when it began
to slow down and cam e to a grad u al stop T hat w asn‚Äôt unusual
T rains often did that M arcella paid no attention to it and neither
did any of the other passengers
A fter a while the lights went out T hat WAS unusual The passeng
ers began to get restless A conductor w as running up and down outside
the coaches swinging a red lantern A second conductor had
stationed him self at the door The day had been hot enough in the first
place but down there in the tunnel it w as stifling The windows of the
cars w ere all closed to keep out the poisonous gases th a t filled the tunnel
at all tim es and w hat little air th ere w as in the beginning w as rapidly
being used up
The baby whose fever had m ounted began to scream at the top of
her lungs Several other passengers began to show signs of uneasiness
Some of the m en got up and approached the door but the conductor
would not let them pass nor would he give any satisfactory explanation
hy the train w as standing still in a d ark and gas-ridden tunnel
F or a few m inutes afte r th a t all w as quiet Then suddenly
panic gripped the people in th a t d ark  stifling car One m an
leaped to a window and threw it open ‚Äú They can ‚Äôt keep us in
h ere to sufTocate like r a ts ‚Äù he shouted ‚Äú I ‚Äôm getting o u t!‚Äù He
clam bered through the window and m any others followed him 
And alm ost im m ediately the coach w as filled with the sulphurous
poisonous gases of the tunnel
‚Äú T hen‚Äù says M arcella ‚Äú te rro r such as I had never known
before gripped m e My baby stopped scream ing suddenly and
becam e very still My little boy leaned with u n n atural weight
against my side In the pitch darkness everyone w as gasping
for breath Some m an shouted to everyone to lie down on the
floor I couldn‚Äôt get down w ith the two children But I prayed‚
and how I prayed!
Coal G as F ills P assen g er Coaches
‚Äú Women w ere fainting and m en ‚Äôs lungs w ere w racked with a hacking
cough th at only filled them with m ore coal gas I felt as if a hand of
steel w ere gripping at m y throat Then I began to sink down into a
dark black pit of nothingness th at seem ed to becoming up to m eet me
( tried to fight it off but it seem ed it w as no use D eeper and deeper
into the gloom I sank Subconsciously I felt the train ja r and shake
but by th a t tim e it didn‚Äôt m ean anything It is the last thing I rem em bered
Then I w as unconscious‚Äù
Now let‚Äôs go back and tell the p a rt of the story M arcella
didnt know anything about W hat had happened w as th a t a
coupling had broken and the front p a rt of the tra in had gone on
leaving the last two coaches behind in the m iddle of the tunnel
It w as the exact opposite of a collision but the conductors realized
th a t it was serious nevertheless One of them w ent out into the
gas-filled tunnel with a red lantern to m ake sure th at the c a rs
w erent hit by another train  while the other tried to keep the
passengers from leaving the com parative safety of the car
When the front of the broken train reached the m eadow s the loss of
the two c a rs w as discovered and an em ergency engine w as sent im m ediately
B ut it had taken 20 m inutes to accom plish that and in the
m eantim e the p assengers in those two stranded c a rs had breathed in
b lot of coal gas
A m bulances w ere w aiting when they reached the m outh of the tunnel
to give first aid ‚Äú And m aybe you think we didn‚Äôt need it‚Äù says M arcella
‚Äú My little boy and I w ere revived alm ost im m ediately but it
w as only with a terrific struggle th a t m y little g irl‚Äôs life was saved‚Äù
And if M arcella had to go through another railroad accident I think
ghed pick a good old-fashioned collision in preference to one of those
trick accidents w here the c a rs all go in different directions

A PRESENT-DAY nutritionist m ight easily q u a rre l with the
traditio n al distinction betw een flsh flesh and fowl For
th e flesh of fish cattle sw ine sheep and poultry is com m only
referred to as ‚Äú m e a t; and the nutritiv e values of all these
foods properly m ay be considered together T heir com position
is very sim ilar consisting principally of protein w ater
and fat with the chief variation occurring in the fat content
They also av e ra g e about one
p e r c e n t o f m in e r a ls a n d co n - j best source becom es available
ta in s o m e o f th e v ita m in s in Fish liver oils a re the richest natv
arying am ounts
Fish vi Other Flesh Foods
T here is a wide variation am ong
the different kinds of fish in the
am ount of fat they
contain In general
fish have less
fat and m ore w ater
than other form s of
m eat Their tissue
fibers are also
shorter w h i c h
m akes for ease of
digestion In m any
casos
is loss pronounced
9 k because there are
few er extractives
F o r this reason fish is considered
less stim ulating and th at is also
why it is often served with some
sort of sauce or with a lemon
garnish to point up the flavor
The proteins of fish are re g a rd ed
as equally useful with other
form s of m eat for helping to build
and rep air body tissues Most lean
fish are richer in m inerals than
fatty fish; in this respect they
resem ble lean m eats
S alt w ater fish are notable as
a source of iodine required for
the proper functioning of the thyroid
gland It is desirable that
this m ineral be included in the
d ietary to help prevent sim ple
goiter
Tho Cattle of tho Sea
The m ost significant difference
between fish and m ost other flesh
foods is th at with the exception of
certain shellfish which a re produced
under governm ent regulation
‚Äú crops‚Äù from the sea are
n either planted by m an nor cultivated
by him
Unlike the fa rm e r or the cattle anl o r em ergencies
ural sources of vitam in D This
vitam in is necessary for the prope
r utilization of calcium and phosphorus
in building strong bones
and sound teeth We prize highly
the liver oils of the cod halibut
salm on swordfish and tuna for
their fine am ount of this precious
vitam in
The body oils of certain fish are
also valued for their vitam in D
Some v arieties that are notable
in this respect are salm on herring
and sardines It is ag reeable
as well as econom ical to obtain
vitam in D by serving seafood
because fish supplies so m any
other valuable nutrients a t the
sam e tim e
are rich in iodine and they m ight
be com pared to the g landular organs
such as liver and kidney
as a source of three vitam ins A
B and G
Place of Fith in tho Diet
The m ost im portant contribution
of all form s of fish is their proteins
which as we have seen m ay
be used interchangeably with
those of beef pork lam b veal
and poultry The iodine of se afoods
and shellfish is also extrem
ely im portant and in some
varieties the content of vitam ins
A and D The m ore fatty fish including
m ackerel salm on eels
herring catfish and shad are comparatively
rich in energy values
The fuel value of cod flounder
perch sm elts and haddock which
a re low in fat and halibut and
whitefish which have a m oderate
am ount m ay be increased through
the use of a rich sauce or they
m ay be cooked in fat
Taking into consideration its
food values and econom y and
when the preserved form s are utilized
its ease of p reparation the
hom em aker who desires to feed
her fam ily well should serve fish
or shellfish in som e form  much
oftener than once each week!
Questions Answered 
Fish Is Universally Available
T here are perhaps m ore v arieties
of fish than any other type
of first-class protein food A govern
m en t bulletin has listed 40
kinds besides sm oked and salted
fish and the various shellfish
Thus the use of fish provides
