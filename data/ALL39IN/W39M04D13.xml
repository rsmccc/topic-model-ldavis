FORTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY. WISCONSIN, THURSDAY, APRIL 13. 1939 NUMBER 22
Church Officers Meet
With Local Boards
More Reorganization
For about three years the 13,000
employes of the state government—
some of them worried, and all of them
interested— have been hearing about
plans to effect drastic changes in the
pattern of organization of the state
government’s administrative machinery.
The discussion started when Governor
La Follette appointed a citizens’
committee to pore over the public
welfare problem in Wisconsin, and to
make recommendations for improving
the administration of state departments
in a field which was growing
ever more important and costly; pensions,
relief, child welfare, prisons,
hospitals, and others.
The committee’s report reached the
governor and tho legislature just as
the La Follette administration started
to make plans for extending the reorganization
which that report urged
into other departments of the state
government. The result was a reorganization
program which effected
many changes in the state capitol and
figured prominently in the 1938 state
election campaigns because of the
charges of “dictatorship” leveled at
the Progressive administration and
La Follette.
The La Follette changes were shortlived,
however. With the arrival of
the new Republican administration
headed by Governor Julius Heil in
January, among the first bills introduced
were measures to repeal what
the previous administration had done
in the field of reorganization. The
Republicans, they announced, had
their own reorganization campaign,
one which would install “ business efficiency
and economy” in the state
government.
Centralized Authority
While many of the new administration’s
reorganization ideas — which
fcav« the central theme of centralization
of authority and administration—
will be achieved by specific legislation
at this session, it was apparent this
week that even more is expected from
the job laid out for the new research
bureau created by the legislature at
the request of the governor.
The research bureau will burrow into
all state departments, institutions,
and functions, with a view to making
improvements and effecting savings.
I t will have the power to hold hearings,
summon state officials and employes
for testimony, examine all
books, files, accounts, records of state
agencies, at private hearings. It will
be manned by a director chosen by
Governor Heil, who will have the
authority to hire as much help, and as
many experts as he needs.
On its way through the houses of
the legislature, Progressives pointed
out that the bill creating the bureau
contained no provision that its employes
must be hired from civil service
lists . That, they charged, proved that
the Republicans meant to use the new
department as a patronage instrument,
to provide jobs for Republican
friends of the administration. They
characterized the new bureau as a
“ snoopers’ department” and a “ pie
counter.”
Meanwhile there were reports in
Republican circles that the bureau
may work for the next six or eight
months on its study of the state government
and its operations, and that
after it reports its recommendations
for changes, or improvements, to
Governor Heil, the executive may call
a special session of the legislature to
write those recommendations into law.
According to reliable reports, Lieut.
Gov. W’alter S. Goodland, supposed to
be the father of the research bureau,
favors a special session for this purpose
next January.
Although debate in the legislature
on the bureau was on the presumption
that the department would receive an
appropriation of $15,000 annually for
its work, observers discovered after
the bill had been made law that there
is a “ sum sufficient” included in the
measure. That means that the department
can ask for as much money
as it wants, within the limits of the
state treasury.
Dairy Suggestions
After studying the topic which has
been the subject of much earnest discussion
in dairying circles recently,
stabilization of dairy prices, College
of Agriculture economists this week
week suggested that dairymen take a
cue from the methods in which certain
mass production manufacturing industries
control prices through controlling
output.
“W’hen the industrial prices are
fixed the quantity is adjusted to what
the consumers will purchase at the set
Dr. A. J. Aasgaard, president of
the Norwegian Lutheran Church of
America, and Charles Nasby, the
church body’s auditor, were present
at a special meeting of the board of
directors of the Homme Home for the
Aged on Wednesday and at a special
meeting of the board of directors of
the Homme Orphan Home this afternoon.
A t yesterday’s meeting, the
main thing considered was the revaluation
of the endowment fund of the
Homme Home for the Aged as submitted
to its manager. This was
thoroughly explained by President
Aasgaard and Auditor Nasby, and the
board then approved the new valuation.
Other matters affecting the institution
in a general way were discussed
and acted upon.
While at the Home, President Aasgaard
gave a fine talk, based on a
Bible text, in the chapel to the residents
and personnel of the Home.
Various matters, including necessary
improvements and repairs to
buildings, were discussed at the meeting
at the Homme Orphan Home this
afternoon.

SCHOOL NEWS
Activity Season
With the passing of the spring recess
the high school students are
submerged in various activities that

Pure Intonation and
Personality Required
of the St. Olaf Singers
A musical organization of sixty
voices with no member of greater im portance
than the fellow singer with
whom he rubs shoulders is the celebrated
St. Olaf choir of Northfield,
Minnesota.
When it sings here on April 20,
1039, at the Central school auditorium,
there will be incidental solos by
iopamos, contraltos, tenors and
bassos, but none of the voices will be
featured. This policy is one upon
which Dr. F Melius Christiansen, director
of the world-famous organization,
insists. For he says that his
objective requires the submerging of
the individual into the group.
“Soloists ruin choirs,” he comments
tersely. “ Pure intonation and personality
are what I require of my members.
Sometimes I have to substitute
a singer with less training for
beautiful voice because the latter
cannot fit into our scheme of things.”
Dr. Christiansen selects his choir
from three hundred or more students
who seek membership in it annually.
St. Olaf college is a liberal arts institution
with an enrollment of approximately
one thousand under graduates.
Tickets can be secured at Larson's
Food Store.
Improves Equipment
Joe' Komp this week installed a
new and improves! finisher with a modern
trimmer, of the I^andis make, in
his shoe and harness repair shop.
Joe, in his new quarters, into which

of the finest shops to be found in this
section. Joe is fast gaining a reputation
as an expert in shoe and harness
repairing and enjoying an ever increasing
business.

German6Encirclement9 Rushed
But Poland Fears Firm Stand
- B y J o s e p h W . L a B i n e -
E D IT O R ’S N O T E— When opinions art
expressed in these columns, they art those
of tha newa analyst, and not necessarily
ot tbe newspaper.
E u ro pe
14The regime of pre-war days had but
one fault—it knew the devilish plan of
encircling and attacking us, yet it lacked
the pouer or will to u w d it off . . . No
power in the world can ever again force
u j to our knees.**
Thus spoke Adolf Hitler at Wilhelmshaven,
one day after B ritain’s
Prim e Minister Chamberlain had
shocked the world by promising to
defend Poland against Nazi aggression.
Though Der Fuehrer barked
boldly, it appeared the heretofore
ineffectual Stop Hitler drive had at
PO LAND 'S JO S E F BECK
He will continue fence-straddling.
iast taken small roots, and that Germ
an y was indeed being encircled.
Outside of Russia, which still
scoffs at French-British solidarity
efforts, R um ania and Poland are
eastern Europe’s principal anti-Nazi
frontiers. Even as Mr. Chamberlain
announced the new Polish guarantee,
France was busying herself with
R um an ia. In Paris the French
agreed to double their purchase of
R um an ia n oil and slash 60 per cent
cff import duties on R um anian farm
products. Thus will King C arol’s
Bucharest government be protected
from complete economic overlordship
under the new trade treaty
forced by Germany.
Within a few more days other results
appeared. R um an ia and Poland,
with French-British blessing,
reportedly renovated their twopower
military alliance to make it
operative against Germany as well
as Soviet Russia. At the same time
Britain apparently extended border
guarantees to R um ania.
There was good likelihood, however,
that scoffing Russia m ight be
right. En route to London for a
three-day conference, Poland's Foreign
Minister Josef Beck found a
chilly reception in Berlin, which
probably made him acutely aware
that he must make no rash com m itments
to the British. After straddling
the political fence for years,
Poland had its choice between m ercy
at the hands of Germany or a
"security” with France and Britain,
the latter meaning little in the light
of Czecho-Slovakia’s experience.
A good sign of Polish thought was
the comment in Kurjer Poranny,
semi-official newspaper: “ There is
no alliance or bloc . . . the British
commitments are not in contradiction
to nonaggression treaties signed
by Poland with Germany and Russia
. . . Poland always tries to conform
not only to the formal side of
these treaties but also to their spirit.
Asia
For almost a year Japanese aggression
against French-British colonial
interests has followed on the
heels of European dictator coups.
W’ith London and Paris jittery after
Munich, Tokyo walked into Canton.
On February 10, just after Italian
troops helped General Franco capture
Barcelona and put democracies
on the run again, Ja p a n occupied
strategic Hainan island which was
smack in the middle of the French-
British sphere of interest. Moreover,
the seizure defied an earlier
agreement with France.
W'ith France and Britain again jit tery
in the wake of Hitler’s Czech
and Memel conquests, Ja p a n has
struck again. The victim : France,
who in 1933 laid formal cla im to the
seven Spratly islands lying 350 miles
southwest of the American Philip*
pines, 350 miles west of British Borneo
and 350 miles east of French
Indo-China.
Though discovered in 1867, the islands
went unclaimed until F rance’s
declaration of sovereignty. Useful
economically only for phosphate, the
Spratly group offers Ja p a n a snug
haven for seaplanes and submarines
which m ight disrupt French-British-
U. S. trade. At Tokyo the foreign
office pointed out that Japs have
worked Spratly phosphates since
1917, investing capital and establishing
sm all settlements. But since
France neglected to establish adm
inistrative jurisdiction (a grave
oversight) Ja p a n decided to claim
the reefs “ to eliminate disadvantages
and inconveniences.”
The expected result of France's
protest: Nothing.
Spain
Though recognition by the United
States again placed Cen. Francisco
Franco's Spain in the good graces
I of international society (all other ma-
| jor powers had previously recognized
the Nationalist government)
the war-torn Iberian peninsula still
faces a tremendous task. Franco’s
sole ineffectual international gesture
| as a European power has been to
join Germany, Italy and Ja p a n in
the anti-Communist pact. Having
thus shown European democracies
his heels, the tired generalissimo
could turn to more pressing internal
problems. Among them:
Order. Though Spain needs m anpower
to rebuild, many moons will
pass before unemployment will be
solved. Still breathing in their second
wind after 32 months of war,
discharged Spanish soldiers will not
readily bow to anything less than
m ilitary law. Franco's answer is
expected to be a 1,000,000-man army
until early 1940.
Health. Substantiated reports
from Madrid tell of a scurvy-like
disease sweeping former Loyalist
territory, caused by lack of fresh
fruits, vegetables and milk. Its medicine
chest emptied, short of bandages,
iodine, salves and medicines,
Spain has sent hurry-up orders to
cope with the sorriest physical plight
an enlightened nation has suffered
in modern times.

Senor Besteiro was arrested and

Casado.
Finance. Before the war Spain’s
gold reserve of $740,000,000 was exceeded
only by the U. S., Britain
and France. Also on hand were vast
hoards of silver. By April, 1938, the
U. S. federal reserve bulletin reported
Spanish gold had dropped to
$525,000,000, and by this month as
General Franco entered Madrid, nobody
apparently knew where any
Spanish gold might be. One vague
hint was that Marino G amboa, a rich
Loyalist-sympathizing Filipino, had
moved most of it to Mexico and
thereby insured the solvency of Loyalist
refugees. Meanwhile Nationalist
Spain held an empty bag.

« Briefly Told »
Labor
The unhappy plight of U. S.
employer-employee relations may be
due either to (1) the Wagner labor
relations act, or ( I) American Federation
of Labor's battle with Congress
of Industrial organizations.
Like an impatient school teacher,
both congress and the White House
have resolved to end this squabble,
the White House by sponsoring A. F.
of L.-C. I. O. peace talks, congress
by amending the Wagner act.
When A pril 11 was chosen starting
date for senate committee hearings
on Wagner amendments, labor
peace talks were in fu ll bloom. But
so strong are the workingman's feelings
about the proposed changes that
many a peace advocate thought
hearings might have been delayed
uptil labor’s warring factions either
make up or draw swords.
To amend the Wagner act, congress
can pick from four sets of proposals,
all opposed by C. I. O., three
of them submitted by coherent factions
with special interests:
(1) By Massachusetts' Sen. David
I. Walsh, obviously favored by A. F.
of L ., which opposes all other proposals:
C urtail the national labor
relations board's power to invalidate
union contracts; require N L R B elections
by craft rather than by industrial
units; perm it employer petitions
for elections: p erm it appeals
in representation cases.
(2) By Nebraska's Sen. Edward
R. Burke, and supported by the potent,
strike-weary National Association
of Manufacturers: Require that
N L R B have representative from labor,
management and the public;
outlaw deduction of union dues from
pay envelopes; outlaw "coercion”
by either employers or unions; establish
code of ‘‘unfair labor practices”
for unions as well as em ployers;
forbid strikes unless a m a jority
of employees approve; require
all union officials to be U. S. citizens;
permit transfer of “ unfair labor
practice" charges from N L R B to
federal district court.
(3) By Oregon's Sen. Rufus Holm
an : To split N L R B 's duties. Administrative
and investigatory power
would be vested in a labor relations
commissioner. F in al decisions
would be made by a nine-member
labor appeals board.
(4) By Kentucky's Sen. M. M. Logan,
supported by the National
Grange and other farm groups: To
extend exemption of agricultural
workers under the Wagner act to
processors and packers of farm
produce.

T. E . Dewey
WASHINGTON. - New Dealers
close to the White House are actually
conducting a publicity c am paign
which would seem calculated
to aid the nomination for President
by the Republicans next year of a
m an President Roosevelt cordially
dislikes. That m an is Thomas E.
Dewey.
Not that this publicity campaign
is praising Dewey. Quite the contrary.
It avoids any
reference to Dewey
whatever. No, the
cam paign takes the
form of trying to
wreck the m an who
is regarded as Dewey’s
chief contender
for the Republican
nomination. Senator
Robert A. Taft of
Ohio.
If any group of 10
or more persons is
polled as to the m an they would
name if going into a pool on the R e publican
nominee, a majority of
them will be found to be voting for
Dewey. This is by no means to say
that a m ajo rity of every such group
actually favors Dewey—that rem
ains to be demonstrated by polls.
But he is the m an a m ajority of
people seem to think has the edge
at the present moment.
If the same groups are asked to
name the m an they would give second
place in probabilities, Senator
Taft is almost unvaryingly the one
named. This is not a matter of conjecture,
and is not news. It is merely
stating the foundation on which
the activities of an important group
of New Dealers seem to be based.
Every tim e in the last few months
when a group of New Dealers would
be at some party or gathering where
friendly newspaper men were—especially
parties where there could be
mixing around and small group conversations,
it has been noticed that
within a few days attacks on Taft
would appear in the newspapers represented
by these correspondents. It
has happened too many times to be
a coincidence.
New Dealers, It Appears,
Do Xot Uke Senator Taft
One explanation, of course, lies in
the fact that of all the men who
have been prominently mentioned as
probabilities for the Republican
nomination, Senator Taft is beyond
doubt the one whom most ardent
New Dealers would dislike most to
have as President. He stands foursquare
against more New Dealisms,
and is on record as criticizing them
and demanding their repeal, than
any other Republican who has been
mentioned as having a chance for
the White House.
F ar more, for example, than Sen.
Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts,
who is inclined to be liberal
on m any issues. F a r more than
even Sen. Arthur H. Vandenberg of
Michigan, who is probably more
popular personally than almost anyone
who has been mentioned.
Whereas Mr. Dewey has stated his
position on very few issues indeed
so far as the national picture is concerned.
He is against crime, and
rackets. But so is everybody except
the crim inals and racketeers.
Small Chance for Bill to
Take Profits Out of W ar
With 50 senators pledged to the
proposed bill to take the profits out
of war, it would seem that nothing
could stop its enactment. Yet thc
probability is that it will be stopped,
if not in the senate, then in the
house. The proposal has had a
strange history, often making apparent
progress, but always falling
by the wayside in some unexpected
manner
The answer is simple. Most of the
congressmen backing the measure,
or supporting it, do not want it to
pass. There are a very few sincere
senators and representatives who
believe that it would be a good
thing, but most of them know that
actually it would do little to prevent
the country getting into war,
and its presence on the statute books
during the period immediately preceding
our entry into war would be
little short of a catastrophe.
Let us assume that the bill became
law, as the present demonstration
of strength among senators
would indicate that it readily might.
From the day war was declared,
any corporation which made any
profits from supplying war m aterials
to the government would be
taxed virtually 100 per cent of those
profits. So there would be no selfish
reason for any manufacturer to desire
to get the country into war.
That is the real object of the
legislation. Its backers want to atop
the machinations by which the wicked
munitions makers involve the
world in suffering, destruction and
death just in order to make their
own filthy profits. The public is
very well sold on this idea. There
have been lota of plays, movies and
propaganda putting it over. There
has never been anything approaching
a sane consideration of the question.
But now let us assume that the
steel makers of this country clearly
see that the United Statea ia bound
to be involved in a m ajo r war. Under
norm al circumstances every one
of them, with the war and navy department
experts prodding them at
every turn, would begin getting
ready. Before war was declared,
unless it came with terrific suddenness,
their plants would be ready to
start turning out munitions and guns
of the precise type needed by the
arm y and navy.
United States Nary Made
Good Showing in World War
As a matter of fact, the United
States navy made a very good showing
in the World war, while F ranklin
D. Roosevelt was assistant secretary,
because Sam McGowan, the
paymaster general of the navy, got
away with murder in placing orders
before the war declaration.
That is why the navy was fixed so
much better than the arm y, and
why it was so much less criticized.
But under the proposed law any
steel manufacturer who spent a penny
on the chance that the United
States m ight get ir.to the war would
be a traitor to his stockholders, even
if he had shown a patriotic spirit.
Why? Because there would not be
a chance of his making any money
for his stockholders, and there would
be the cold certainty that, in addition
to not m aking any money during
the war period, he would run
into severe losses immediately after
the war period.
The history of every munitionsm
aking enterprise in private hands
has been that it made big profits
during the war, and then took terrific
losses after the war, what with
cancelled orders, unused inventories
and unneeded expansions of plant.
So they just wouldn't. »
Answer: Government monopoly of
the munitions manufacturing business
if the law passes. And the
arm y and navy don't like that. They
fear congress would never be liberal
enough in advance to have the nation
properly prepared.
Unlikely to Be Railroad
Legislation at This Session
It is very unlikely that there will
be any railroad legislation at this
session of congress. Congress has
been tussling with legislation to put
the railroads back on the track to
financial stability almost continuously
for the last 20 years. Their
condition has been worse instead of
better and no laws will be enacted
this session which can be of any significant
benefit to them without the
prospect of a larger volume of traffic.
The very best that congress can
do is to help the roads take better
advantage of more business when it
comes.
The problem resolves itself into an
attempt to put a better face on the
plain fact that the public demands
several transportation services but
refuses and probably is actually unable,
certainly at times, to support
them all adequately — railroads,
trucks, busses, inland and intercoastal
waterways, pipe lines, and
air lines. What the public as a shipper
won’t pay has been met to some
extent by subsidies but with the idea
more of provoking extension of alternative,
competitive services than
of maintaining them.
Difficult for Congress to
Turn Out Satisfactory l.au>
Couple the railroads’ proposals as
presented to congress in the "c om mittee
of six” bill with the opposition
of water, highway and air lines,
plus the objections of the railroads
and their employees to any compulsion
to develop more compact
operating systems by consolidation
and co-ordination, then add the resistance
of creditors to accepting
losses inevitable in railroad reorganization
which offers any prospect
of continuing solvency, and the
chances are slim indeed that congress
will be able to grind out a
law that is of any more durable
value than the transportation act of
1920, or the emergency transportation
act of 1935.
In the last year two separate and
opposed expeditions into the transp

why I shouldn’t have told h im ? ”
“ AU this fuss over a little nonsense,"
Ainsworth muttered.
"There's a great difference in
taste about jokes.” Hale pointed out.
"George thinks I ought to have you
put in bonds to keep the peace, and
all that sort of thing. But I'm hoping
that won’t be necessary. I ’m
hoping you and I can come to such
an am icable understanding about
the little Kneeland m atter that we
won’t even have to consider our
personal complications. How about
it? ”
“ So that's your scheme?” Ainsworth
set his teeth. “ I ’ll see you in
hell before I ’ll dicker with you about
m y c la im ."
Hale rose.
“ A ll rig h t," he said regretfully.
“ Then I ’ll have to press my personal
charge of attempted m urder.”
“ All of which means,” Ainsworth
muttered, “ that you’re going to try
to use this cock-and-bull story to do
me out of a just c la im .”
“ No, it doesn’t mean that,” Hale
said tolerantly. “ It might, but it
doesn't. Being in a strong position,
I ’m going to be merciful. How much
w ill you take to sign a quit-claim on
Kneeland and clear o u t?"
“ T hat’s easy. H alf his annual
profits.”
“ I ’ll bet you would—but you
won’t. Now I ’ll tell you what you
will do. I ’ll make an offer. If you
don’t accept it in five minutes I ’ll
decrease it 25 per cent. I ’m not
bluffing, Ainsworth. I mean exactly
what I say. I ’m fed up with you.
I don't care much how this case
ends. Here's what Kneeland will
do. H e'll give you a hundred thousand
dollars worth of stock and
guarantee you an income of six
thousand a year from it for the rest
of your life. He’ll pay the first quarter’s
interest in advance. He’ll turn
over the stock to you and you’ll
both sign a cast-iron agreement in
John Phelps’ office tomorrow m orning.
You will also agree, of course,
never to sell the stock. How about
it? Y o u ’ve got exactly five minutes
to decide.”
"A ll righ t,” Ainsworth said suddenly.
“ I was getting bored here
anyway. Six thousand a year isn't
to be sneezed a t."
"Y o u bet it isn't. Then we can
regard that as a barg a in?”
"Y o u ca n .”
Ainsworth and Rex met Kneeland
in his office the following morning.
The interview proceeded in an atmosphere
of suppressed suspicion.
E ach of the principals revealed ■
gloomy conviction that he had the
worse of the bargain. However,
both signed the impressive legal
documents and the affair was concluded.
Hale alone was satisfied.
He had got over his second hurdle.
I f there was still another in the offing
he was not yet sure what it
was. He had had enough worldly
experience to know that in this im perfect
life one's best efforts are
usually taken as a matter of course
by those who benefit by them. He
had not looked for appreciation from
either Ainsworth or Kneeland. He
was not pained by its absence.
If Jo a n had missed Hale during
his brief absence she gave no sign
of it on his return that night. She
was very subdued, but brightened a
trifle when he mentioned his wish to
ask Stuyvesant to the Camp. Hale
felt a pang of jealousy which he
briskly suppressed. Again he assured
himself that he was not in
love with Joan Kneeland and that
he never would be; but he knew better.
She increasingly filled the foreground
of his thoughts and of his
life.
He was experiencing a slight reaction
from the strain of the past
days— a tendency to lie on the beach
and bask in the sun. He indulged
it. He felt that was entitled to a
short vacation His sense of wellbeing
lasted till F r day night of the
following week. Then, with Stuyvesant's
arriv al for the week-end visit,
it merged into an acute and painful
jealousy. Stuyvesant was a welcome
addition to the house-party.
Mrs. Spencer Forbes openly neglected
Hale for h im ; Miss Hosanna, too,
showed symptoms of waning allegiance.
These things did not disturb
h im . It was Joan's liking for
Stuyvesant that hurt. Joan, however,
was not wholly at her best.
She and Bert spent Saturday in the
motor-boat with Stuyvesant and
Hale, and picknicked through the
noon hours at a romantic spot up
the coast. The four young things had
their luncheon there under the trees.
It was a good luncheon and Banks
had packed it with tender solicitude.
Jo a n ate none of i t She had
supplied herself with a sm all thermos
bottle fu ll of milk. O f this, at
intervals, she poured out and languidly
drank a sm a ll quantity.
There was no snap about her. Looking
at her. Hale worried. Doctor
Crosby had extended his stay in
New York. His secretary had telephoned
that the doctor was held
there all week, by a very sick patient
at one of the hospitals. He
could not return till Monday of the
second week, and therefore could
make no appointments till Tuesday.
Joan had accepted the message
with more than resignation. “ I really
don’t need h im at a ll," she declared
resentfully.
But Hale made the appointments
for her and Bert. Bert was im proving
daily. His appetite was
good, and he assured Hale that he
slept nine hours every night. He
had always been a serious youth.
Today, though he seemed to enjoy
h im . " I ’m no philanthropist. Things
are going pretty well with me, considering
the times. For the last
eighteen months I ’ve been looking
around for the right m a n to help
me. I ’m not saying I ’ve been rushing
about with a lantern, or anything
of that sort. I can worry
along. On the other hand I can certainly
keep a good m an busy from
now on. Like you, I ’m thinking of
the future. When your voice came
over the telephone that first day, I
got a real kick out of it. I said to
myself, ‘Here’s the combination I
need!’ I was sure of it by the time
we’d finished luncheon, but I didn't
want to rush you. However, I did
suggest that you should ask me out
here, and I reminded you of the
suggestion again last week. It
wasn’t because of Miss Kneeland,
either," he added complacently.
"She's a peach, but I ’ve got a perfectly
good girl of m y own. We’re
I waited. That's partly why I didn’t
go in with our classmate Flaherty.
He suggested it two years ago and
I adm it I was tempted. He's got
T ammany eating out of his hand.
He's simply coining money. But
fancy having Flaherty as a partner!
Wouldn’t there be fireworks?"
His voice changed. “ Then it’s settled?”
he asked eagerly.
“ It's settled.”
They shook hards on it. and were
startled by Jo a n Kneeland’s low
laugh. She and Bert had grown
tired of waiting on the shore and
had come back for them.
“ A touching scene,” Joan said.
“ You fly from us, we pursue. We
find you apparently going through
an eternal farewell. Has Mr. Stuyvesant
had all he can endure of
our simple life? Is he taking the
five-thirty tra in ? ”
“ F a r from it,” Stuyvesant told
her. “ I'm planning now to stay all
Joan bad supplied herself with a thermos bottle of milk.
the chatter of his companions, he
took little part in it. Joan was
more responsive, but she contributed
only a sm all share to the persiflage
of the other two.
Hale saw that Stuyvesant was
watching her with an odd expression
in his keen eyes.
“ I ’ve never seen such a change in
anyone in such a short time as there
is in Miss Kneeland,” he confided,
when they were alone for a few
moments. "She was a wise-cracking
butterfly last winter, if you know
what I mean. She was amusing
and full of pep and interested in
everything. What's happened to
her?”
Rex answered the question with
another.
“ Do you think she looks sick?”
“ Yes, I do,” Stuyvesant said flatly.
“ You see, I ’ve only known her a
few weeks myself,” Rex explained.
“ For all I know she has always been
like this. She’s variable, but so are
most girls. Some days she’s quite
cheerful and amusing. Then again
she’ll be as she is today—uninterested,
almost dull. I haven't known
quite what to make of her. The
Ainsworth business was going on,
as I've told you, and I've been taken
up with that and one or two other
things. She says she’s only run
down and tired. My own theory is
that Halcyon C am p has been a
damned depressing place for her.
I think she's fed up with it and with
most of the people around her. I am
myself,” he added unexpectedly.
Stuyvesant looked at h im in surprise.
"W h a t’s the m atter with you?”
Rex realized that he had said too
much.
"J u s t a bit fed up,” he explained
lightly. “ You see Ainsworth’s little
attentions were something of a
strain. Besides, my future’s on my
mind. I ’m at loose ends. I've got
to look about and find some sort of
an opening. The outlook isn't particularly
rosy."
They were packing the luncheon
dishes back into the basket, while
Bert and Joan carried thc scraps
and paper cups and plates to refuse
barrels some distance away. Then
the cousins had strolled on down
to the beach, evidently expecting
the others to join them. Stuyvesant
slipped an arm through Hale's and
drew h im to a bench among the
tfees.
“ That’s one of the things I came
here to talk to you about," he explained
as they sat down on it. "This
seems as good a time as any. How
would you like to go in with m e ? ”
Rex smiled appreciatively.
" I t sounds great," he admitted.
"B u t I don't want you cooking up
any im aginary job for me, for old
time's sake.”
"T h a t’s rot,” Stuyvesant assured
going to be married in November.
That's one reason why I need you.
I ’ve promised to take her to Egypt
for the honeymoon. We’ll be gone
three months. Incidentally, I want
you to be my best m an at the wedd
ing.”
After this it was some time before
they got back to business. Stuyvesant
was a phonograph record.
He had to be allowed to run down.
Rex listened to him with interest
and a warming sense of relief.
"Y o u needn’t think I ’m offering
you anything very big,” Stuyvesant
went on when they returned to practical
matters. "M y idea is to take
you on for a year or so at a decent
salary—say, what you had in Spain.
After that, if we hit it off, and you
like the prospects, you can buy as
much of an interest in the firm as
you care to take, up to half of it.
How about it? Are you going to tell
me that you’ve got to think it over?”
“ You can bet I ’m not. I ’m all
for the experiment, if you’re sure
you want m e.”
Stuyvesant’s round face grew
very serious.
“ I don’t mind admitting that I ’ve
been sure of that since we were at
Ithaca together.” he said slowly. “ I
picked you out for a future partner
during our first year there.
Nerve on my part, for you hardly
knew I was alive then. Before I
was in a position to even speak of
the plan you had gone to Spain, so
summer with you. You see, I ’ve
realized a boyhood dream in this
hour,” he added exuberantly. " I ’ve
persuaded Hale to join forces with
me. Stuyvesant and Hale! How does
it sound?”
“What he means,” Hale laughed,
“ is that he’s giving me a jo b .”
“ A job with prospects," Stuyvesant
amended ‘ The prospects are
that he’ll do all the work and I ’ll
pocket most of the money. But he
can have a partnership next year, if
he wants it."
“ It sounds like a mighty good arrangement
for you both,” Bert said
with unusual warmth. “ Congratulations.”
His eyes lingered on Hale affectionately.
Thus lar, at least, Herbert
Kneeland had no reservations
in his appreciation of H ale’s services.
He was, as always, reserved
and rather shy. But he lost no opportunity
to show friendliness and
liking for the "home secretary.”
" I 'm glad,” Joan was saying

Cass can throw his burdens on

can I. That may not leave him

for us."
They walked down to the pier, reentered
the motor-boat, and continued
their journey along the shore.

Warned Custer, Aged Indian Relate*,
In Description of Terrible Massacre
I f Gen. George A. Custer had listened
to Charles Copeland, he might
be alive today "though, of course a
very old m an ,” according to Copeland,
a Cherokee Indian with the
tribal name of White Horse who
says he is ninety-three years old,
whites a Colorado Springs United
Press correspondent in the Detroit
Free Press.
Copeland talks in a strange mixture
of old-time phraseology and
modern slang.
He describes the Custer massacre
of June 26, 1876:
“ Yea. brother, this is how it was.
I was there with a bunch of friendly
Indians on our way to an Idaho reservation.
“ We passed through that country
(the battlefield) and talked to Custer
and Sitting Bull. Sitting Bull
was -a big-shot medicine m an and a
great general.
“ 'You know this is not peace,’ I
said to Sitting Bull and he said to
me, 'I know it is not peace, they are
after my hide.’
“ To Custer I said, ’they will get
your hide brother, if you go In there.
Say brother, I know you are a grad- !
uate of West Point, but don’t go in
th e re !’
“ He would not listen. There were
20,000 Indians there and not a man
of Custer’s force was left.”
General Custer with a force of 600
men assumed he was attacking a
party of 1,200 Pawnees whom he believed
marching to join Sitting Bull.
He and all his men were killed.
One of Oldest Universities
Ai Morelia, capital of Michoacan,
Mexico, visitors are attracted to
San Nicolas, oldest university ln the
Americas. Within the university is
a small library that has no books
less than 100 years old, and within
the library is a tomb containing a
two-foot coffin, wherein is the pickled
heart of Melchor Ocampo, Mexican
patriot of the 1850s, who was
slain by anti - government forces.
There, also, is the hair of Ocampo,
his neatly washed shirt and the
trousers that were riddled by the
firing squad. The visitor is shown
his last will: ” 1 being told that I am
about to die, wish to name the following
as my lawful daughters. I
hereby adopt a fifth daughter who
will share in my esta'.e.”
‘Father’ of the Santa
Fe Trail
I N 1821 Capt. W illiam Becknell set
* out from F ranklin, Mo., with four
companions to trade with the Comanche
Indians. Near the mountains
they met a party of Mexicans
who told them of Mexico's successful
revolt against Spain and invited
them to come to Santa Fe to trade.
Although Becknell had only a small
amount of merchandise, he disposed
of it at a great profit. So when he
returned to Missouri, he had no difficulty
in getting Franklin citizens to
invent more than $5,000 in another
trading venture.
Accompanied by a parly of 30
men, Becknell set out for Santa Fe
the next spring. When the caravan
reached the Caches on the
Upper Arkansas, he made a momentous
decision. Instead of continuing
up the Arkansas into what is
now Colorado, then going south by
way of Taos, he decided to attempt
a short cut. It would take him
through an unexplored country but
it would avoid the long and circuitous
mountain route of his first trip.
Counting on finding springs or
streams along tho route, the party
took only a two days’ supply of water.
At the end of that time they
were in a desert country, suffering
the tortures of thirst. In their extremity
they flrst killed their dogs
to drink their blood, then cut off
their mules' ears for the same purpose.
Near the Cimarron river they discovered
an old buffalo bull. They
killed him and drank the water from
his stomach. By this time Becknell
had enough of the “ short cut.”
He led his party north until they
struck the Arkansas and, following
that stream, arrived at last at Taos.
Despite their failure, the route
which Becknell had tried later became
a favorite one for many trading
parties and he is remembered
as the “ father” of the Santa F#
trail.

The First Land Agent
A F T E R the Revolution, New
* * York, disregarding the right of
the Iroquois Indians to the land
south of Lake Ontario, ceded 6,000,-
000 acres to Massachusetts who
promptly disposed of these lands
to Oliver Phelps and Nathaniel Gorham
, for a million dollars.
In 1786 Phelps left Massachusetts
j with a party to explore the vast territory
which he had acquired. After
a 130-mile trip through what was
then a wilderness, he reached the
shores of Canandaigua lake where
he called the Iroquois to a council.
For two days the negotiations proceeded
smoothly. Then the great
Seneca orator. Red Jacket, arose.
He recalled the sufferings of his
people during the Revolution, and
stirred his auditors up to such a
! fury that the little group of white
men began to fear for their lives.
Fortunately for them, another
chief named F arm er's Brother halted
the council until their passions
died down and the next day a satisfactory
treaty was concluded. Then
Phelps began surveying his land
into tracts, called ranges, and subdividing
these into townships, six
miles square. Thus he became the
pioneer in the system of land surveying
used in this country.
In 1789 he achieved another distinction.
He opened a land office
in Canandaigua, said to have been
the first in this country for the sale
of forest lands to settlers, and thus
helped settle western New York.

Adventure After Death
y i C T O R TREVITT was a native
* of New Hampshire, who at the
aga of 14 ran away from home and
became a printer in Chillicothe,
Ohio. By the time he was 20 he
had been in the army and had many
close calls in the Mexican war.
He emigrated to Oregon City,
Ore., in 1854, became territorial
printer, newspaper m an and clerk
in the house of representatives. Next
he took to exploring up the Columbia
river, after which he returned
to Dalles City and opened a tavern
that catered to prospectors. Aa the
town grew, he opened two more taverns.
Soon he was one of its leading
citizens and was sent to the
stale capital to serve as senator.
When he returned to Dalles City,
he found that the free spending era
was over and his taverns were no
I longer profitable. This led him to
gambling at which he made a considerable
fortune. He died on Ja n uary
23, 1883, but this was only the
start of another adventure.
He had made arrangements to be
buried on Memaloose island, the
burying ground for one of the neigh-
I boring Indian tribes. Burial in the
' same ground with a white man was
\ considered “ bad medicine" by the
Indians. The day after Trevitt
was burled there, all who had relatives
in the Memaloose graveyard
dug them up and buried them on the
mainland. Today, am id the scattered
bones of Indians who have no
descendants to remove them, the
body of Victor Trevitt, adventurer,
still rests.

V T E W Y O R K —Ju s t a year ago,

toward “ escapism.” This led to
B . „ „ . . suggestions that

blew over, but here is Mr. Hays
today frankly proclaiming himself a
eudemonist. Our somewhat conservative
dictionary is a bit vague
about it, but, in his rough outlines,
a eudemonist seems to be one who
believes in fairies.
In his annual report as president
of the Motion Picture Producers 
Distributors of America, Mr. Hays
cites with satisfaction the record
box-office success of "Snow White
and the Seven Dw arfs," and is happy
that “ there are still a number of
eudemonists left in the world."
There is no disparaging or invidious
reference to non-eudemonists, but,
since Mr. Hays also reports with
gratification that there are no
“ ism s" and no “ social significance"
in “ Snow White," it is perhaps a
fair inference that such black witchery
is the dram atic antithesis.
Practicing law in Sullivan,

eudemonist. That came later, lie

coppers such oratorical bets with a
remark like this: “ And, after all, it

price,” said the report.
“The price of automobiles,” farmers
were reminded, “ is set by the manufacturer
at the beginning of the season
and commonly remains unchanged
for a year. Prices remain constant
and the adjustment to changing conditions
is made by changing the quantity
offered for sale. Consumer incomes
were considerably lower in 1938
than in 1937, and the number of new
automobiles sold was reduced by one-1
half.”
If the dairy industry is to adopt
fixed prices for a long period, it was
said, a similar adjustment must be
made in the quantity offered consumers
from time to time unless the fixed
price is an extremely low one.
Prison Inadequate
For many years the state legislature
has heard pleas from state institution
officers for more generous
appropriations to rehabilitate their
deteriorating physical plants, and to
expand facilities for the ever-increasing
numbers of patients and prisoners
who entered state hospitals, asylums,
and penal institutions.
One of the most prominent voices in
the biennial cry for larger appropriations
was that of the late Warden
Oscar Lee of the state prison at Waupun,
who died in 1938.
Today his successor, youthful John'
C. Burke is following up the campaign.
One of the youngest prison
heads in the country. Burke in a re-1
port to his superiors on the state
hoard of control a few days ago declared
that inadequate sanitary facilities.
old and outworn buildings, and
crowded conditions at the state prison
at Waupun are a ‘'disgrace to the
state of Wisconsin.”
He said that one of the major cell.
halls at the state’s largest penal institution
was built before the Civil war
and has no plumbing facilities. Prisoners
confined there still receive their
water in old earthen jugs.
The prison buildings were designed,
he continued, to confine 956 inmates.
But recently the population has gone
up as high as 1,740.
He repeated a demand for modernization
and expansion of the Waupun
physical plant, and increased hospital,
sanitation, and educational facilities!
at the institution.
More Jails
Other Wisconsin jail institutions
were in the news this week. From
Blanche Murphy, of the board of control,
whose job it is to inspect municipal
police stations and lockups, and
county jails, came a survey showing ,
that most of the local jails are badly
in need of improvements.
Miss Murphy’s report condemned 60
of Wisconsin’s 70 county jails (Adams
county is the only county in Wisconsin
which has no county jail) as unsanitary
or inadequate for a variety of
reasons. A dozen city police stations
were roundly scored as sub-standard,
while the survey suggested summary;
summary closing of about half of the
lock-ups maintained by small towns,
cities and villages, which are usually
patronized mostly by transients.
The few prisoners the local constables
place in the local lockups could
lie more efficiently sent to county jails,
the report suggested.
The state board of control is author-!
ized to make inspections of county and
municipal jails, but has no authority
to compel compliance with its recommendations.
The survey found most of the larger
cities having satisfactory police stations.
The southern counties, including
Milwaukee, and two in the Fox
River V’alley, Winnebago and Calumet,
were the only ones cited as meeting
requirements among the county institutions.
wave-length number, twist a dial, and
you ring a bell in his home or his
automobile. Immediate use is to en-1
able forest rangers to turn on their |
radios and go to sleep without losing
contact with other forest stations, j
A bell touched off by a short wave
warns the ranger to get up and turn
on his receiving set.
It ’s a rare day that doesn’t see a
forward step on a highroad to Utopia.
Imagine, for instance, the debt humanity
may owe eventually to Gaston
L. Lateur, of San Francisco, California,
who has invented a onehanded
tube for toothpaste or shav- j
ing cream. The cap opens automatic
ally when you squeeze the tube. It j
closes when you release the pressure.
Another unsung hero of this changing
world is Edmund Michcel of New
Orleans. A few years ago his wife j
was ill and nervous. She used to lock j
and bolt the •'door, and then put a
chair under the knob for good measure.
That set Micchel to thinking—
so he invented a special lock. It can’t,
be picked, because there is no keyhole—
only a panel with buttons on
it. Push the right combination of
buttons and the door opens. Push
the wrong combination and a burglar
alarm rings.

Fertilizer Usage
{"GARDENS can’t go on producing
.e x ce lle nt flowers and
vegetables year after year without
an application of fertilizer now
and then. Because stable manure
is difficult to obtain, a complete
commercial fertilizer recommended
by your dealer will prove most
satisfactory. Before applying fertilizer
, however, give consideration
to a few simple, practical
hints.
First, be cautious! Never apply
fertilizer recklessly or over-abundantly.
Don’t be like the m an
who saw a neighbor get good results
from a sparing use of fertilizer.
He proceeded to apply 10
times as much, but expecting 10
times as good results—but his garden
proved worthless.
Broadcast the complete fertilizer
over the soil 10 days before
planting, using about three pounds
per square rod. Three or four
weeks after planting, if the garden
seems a bit backward, apply a
side dressing Sprinkle fertilizer
lightly alongside the rows, about
six inches from the plants; then
cultivate. Apply only from one
to two pounds per square rod of
garden.

You know, there’s always a lot of hard luck on camping
trips. Somebody is sure to get sunburned, and somebody else
always steps on a rusty nail or clips himself with the hatchet
while chopping wood for the fire. The bird who is doing the
cooking burns half the food, and just when you’re comfortably
settled and getting along fine, Farmer Jones comas along and
orders you to move on.
Camping trips just breed hard luck, but the one Syd Rapoport
went on was the champion hoodoo camping trip of them all. It
started dealing out tough breaks before Syd and his pals even
got started.
Syd lives in Brooklyn, N. Y. It was in the summer of 1935
that he and half a dozen other lads began planning that camping
trip. They had picked a spot upstate, in the neighborhood of
Poughkeepsie, and were all ready to go. Then, two days before
they were due to leave, there was a terrific rainstorm in New
York, nnd, after inquiring about the weather, they learned that
it was the same upstate.
The gang decided to go anyway—at least, some of them
did. When the day of the big trip rolled around one fellow
had the mumps. Another was laid up with an infected foot, and two
other fellows h id mothers who said they couldn't go camping in such
weather because they'd catch their death of pneumonia sleeping on damp
ground. The trouble had started early, but it was nothing to what
Syd was to get into before that trip was m an y days older.
The Hikers Find a C amping Site.
“ There were only two brothers and myself le ft," says Syd,
but we went anyway.” The brothers were Harold and Jerry I.eff.
The three of them took a boat to Bear .Mountain and then started
to hike, with two tents and blankets and equipment on their
baeka. After a day on tbe road—and Syd doesn't say whether
they walked or thumbed rides—they reached the spot they had
chosen and picked a camping site.
The ground was wet, and the earth was loose. They had a little
trouble putting up their two small tents. But finally everything was
I t s M o s t E x c i t i n g B l o u s e
S e a s o n K n o w n i n Y e a r s
F inally he had a horrible dream.
shipshape. They got a fire going, cooked a meal, and when they had
eaten it they were ready to turn in. Je rry and Harold occupied one
tent, and Syd slept alone in the other.
Syd dropped ofT to sleep, but he didn't sleep very well. Finally, he
had a horrible dream—a dream that something cold and slimy was
crawling over his arm. The dream woke him up, and as he came
slowly to his senses he realized that that dream was a cold, hard reality.
Something cold and slimy was resting against his arm.
In an instant Syd was wide awake. A full moon was shining
and its bright light streamed in through the open flap of the pup
tent. In that light Syd saw something that made his blood run
cold. H ii arm was lying outside the blanket and a snake had
crawled up and nestled against It. And Syd recognized that
snake for a poisonous copperhead!
Frozen With Fear, He Cannot Move.
Says he: “ My first impulse was to jum p and scream. But I
couldn't have moved to save my life. I was frozen stiff with
fear. The moon bathed the head of the snake with light, and
as I lay there stiff and trembling it crawled up to my shoulder.
A cold sweat broke out on my forehead. Now I began to realize
that I didn’t dare move, even if I could. One move would cause
the reptile to strike.”
But it seemed to Syd that he could hardly keep himself from moving.
Somehow he managed to lie there stiff and still. The hours rolled
on. Syd doesn't know how m any of them went by. Each minute seemed
like a year and each second was like a week of torture. " I wanted to
scream,” he says. " I felt as if I could control myself no longer. At
last the sky began getting gray, and off in the distance I could hear
some farmer's rooster crowing. Then, again, the snake shifted its
position. This tim e it came to rest with its head across m y gullet.”
Now Syd was afraid to swallow for fear of disturbing the snake. He
felt his spine begin to creep and his h air felt as if it were standing up
on his head. It was getting lighter now, and Syd was able to distinguish
objects around him that he had lost sight of when the moon
went d ow n .. Still it was a long time before dawn, and his only hope
was to lie still until his pals awoke.
The Snakes Smelled of Rotten Cucumbers.
He could see the snake clearly now. And then, out of the corner
of his eye, he saw another—and another. There were a bunch
of them in the tent. And two of them were over four feet long.
“ I couldn’t see the others very clearly,” he says, “ for I didn’t
dare turn my head and it strained m y eyes to look at them from
my position. I was beginning to shiver. My muscles were
cramped and saliva dripped from m y mouth. The snakes smelled
of rotten cucumbers and the odor sickened me. But the sun was
coming up, and I could hear movements in the other tent. That
renewed my courage.”
Harold and Jerry were up. A couple of times they walked past Syd's
tent, but they d id n ’t look in. Then Je rry glanced through the open flap
and his eyes froze on the terrifying sight. Syd says he owes his life to
those two brothers. He thought Jerry was going to scream, but he
d id n’t. He remained cool and so did Harold. The pair of them stole
up behind Syd's tent, gathered some d am p hay from a field and set it
afire. Huge billows of smoke poured through the tent.
“ I began choking,” says Syd, "b u t so did the snakes. They moved,
and I lay back and breathed a sigh of relief. After a few minutes I
went outside, picked a spot in the sun'and dozed off. It was seven hours
before I woke up again. And if you want to know what a nightmare is
like, just ask me. I ’ve had dozens of them since that night.”

KFADV TO GO
\\TH E N it comes to drawing the
” crowds it’s the blouse sections
that are doing it these days—most
exciting blouse season known for
years.
The m ain reason for this stampede
in the blouse direction is that
suits rank ace-high in importance
this spring and as every woman and
her sisters and her cousins and her
aunts well know, the proper upkeep
of a suit calls for one chic blouse
after another. However, the fact
that suits are “ tops” this season is
not the only reason for the mad
rush blouseward that is going on.
It's the blouses themselves that are
the magnet that draws, from the
standpoint of “ style” color and m a terial
they are simply not to be
resisted.
The interest displayed in sterling
pure silk weaves for the blouse this
season is especially significant. S im ply
tailored blouses like the one
shown below to the right in the illustration
are indispensable with
your tweeds. This model, a Lelong
creation, is tailored of a heavy exotic
silk crepe in rich deep red. It
has a tucked shirt front fastened
with leather thongs that clasp into
gilt "croquet wickets.”
Collarless jacket suits frequently
has’e the jacket lined in the same
silk print (jacket is often reversible)
as fashions the blouse. Dotted
silks are the rage for this sort of
styling. If it is something out of
the ordinary you are wanting to
fit into the scheme of things take
note of the stunning "b ib blouse"
pictured to the left below. It classifies
under ingenue or schoolgirl
type, which does not mean that it
is restricted to teen-age wear, for
it's the fashion to wear young looking
clothes this spring that belie age
counted in years. The clever big
effect is achieved via an insert of
bold big dots contrasting the tinydot-
print.
The revival of the ornate dressy
blouse reflects the influence of the
gay nineties. See the model in the
upper left corner of the picture. In
creating this lady-type blouse for
dinner or cocktail hours Lanvin alternates
bands of black silk georgette
and val lace finishing it off
with highband neck and turnover
collar.
The revival of the white blouse
with the dark suit is one of fashion's
top-most highlights The Gibson
girl blouse pictured above to
the right is in white silk organdy
with lace-trimmed jabot coming
high at the neck. The bishop sleeve
with its lace-trimmed frill at the
wrists give this blouse the new look
that is copied from the old.
For the be-frilled and lace edged,
tucked and finely hand-worked white
blouse now so fashionable, thin silks
such as silk organdy or silk triple
sheers that will wash well and keep
their whiteness are highly recommended.
Perhaps the biggest sensation in
the present vogue is the white peasant
blouse with full-to-the-wrist long
sleeves that gather into a tight band
such as are worn with the very
new gypsy skirts fashioned of vivid
striped or plaid silk. For this blouse,
designers use washable white silk
chiffon or white silk organdy with
gratifying results.
In the color madness that has
gripped the world of fashion blouses
are playing a d ram atic role. Surah
silk is a great favorite, printed or
plain, stressing chartreuse, fuchsia,
yellow gold, rust, violet, mustard
and citrus colors.

Ukulele It of European
The ukulele is essentially a small
guitar with four strings and was introduced
to the Hawaiians in the
latter part of the Eighteenth century
by Portuguese sailors. So far
as known, the guitar itself is of
European origin, observes a writer
in the Indianapolis News.
In the Royal library at Stuttgart,
Germ any, is a manuscript dated
1180 A. D. which contains a representation
of the instrument. The
H awaiians imitated and modified
the smaller guitar of the Portuguese
and popularized it under the name
“ ukulele " The same instrument,
particularly adapted to the wistful
minors peculiar to the native music
Origin; Known for Ages
of H awaii, became an instrument of
jazz in the United States.
“ Ukulele" is a native word, being
derived from "u k u ” (flea or Insect)
and "le le ,” (to ju m p ). Thus "u k u lele”
literally means "jum p in g
flea,” • name no doubt suggested by
the motions of the fingers of the
players over the instrument. The
most common English pronunciation
of the name is "yoo-koo-lay-le,"
although "oo-koo-lay-lay” more
nearly approaches the Hawaiian
pronunciation.
Hawaiian ukuleles are generally
made of koa, a fine-grained wood
obtained from the native tree called
"a ca cia koa.”

Cottons Have New
Roles This Spring
Cottons have new roles in the creation
of spring fashions. Pique and
linen, for example, are used for
white toques and sailors to wear
with navy blue suits. These fabrics
also are important for collar and
cuff sets that are attached to dark
evening dresses. Gloves also are
being made of these washable m a terials.
Gingham accents are equally as
popular and unusual in their application
to newest costumes. Plaid
gingham pipings appear as trim ming
on navy blue reefer suits and
also make matching blouses.

New Hairdress Is
Becoming Popular
A new hairdress covers the entire
head in flat curls that remind of
a boyish bob. It is very youthful
and is referred to as the “ little g irl”
hairdress. The high-do for hair is
seen less in the daytime but still
persists for formal occasion. At the

fashion is popular. A pleasing
compromise is the arrangement that
brings curls or puffs to the front
in somewhat of a pompadour effect,
with the almost shoulder-length
end-curl bob at the back.

By C. HOUSTON GOUDISS
TO NEARLY every adult, weight is a matter of great concern.
Thin people step on the scales in the hope of finding
that they have gained a pound or two. Fat people sometimes
weigh themselves several times a day, trusting each time
that the arrow will point to a slightly lower figure. In many
cases, the reason for this absorbing interest is vanity—a
desire to look better. But the real objective should’be to
attain the weight at which wiP]
feels better, for few people
realize that to weigh neither
too much nor too little is one
of the best possible aids to
buoyant health. Moreover, the
secret of weight control for
normal individuals lies in the
kind and amount of food consumed.
The science of nutrition teaches
us that all body fat originates as
surplus fuel . . .
that is, food which
has been consumed
over and above the
immediate requirements
of the body
machine. It therefore
follows that in
mined that in people of this type,
the digestive tract is usually shorter
than in those having a stocky
build. Moreover, they tend to be
more tense, more active and of a
more nervous temperament. As a
result, the passage of food through
the digestive tract may be so rapid
that it leaves the body before
all the available nutrients can be
utilized. At the same time, these
active people tend to burn up more
of their food for energy, so it is
not surprising that they fail to
store body fat, unless the diet is
especially planned to meet their
needs.
Concentrated Foods Desirable
The well balanced diet, with its
. .. . full quota of minerals and vitagenera
t e pro - m jns ls basic to good health for
lem of gaining or
losing weight is
concerned with an
increase or reduction
in the total
fuel value of the diet.
Shortage or Surplus of Fuel
Those who find it difficult, after
30, to avoid taking on excess
pounds must learn to reduce the
total fuel intake. Otherwise, they
m ay find themselves burdened
with a mounting surplus of fat,
which not only destroys beauty,
but impairs health, and tends to
decrease both mental and physiall.
But in order to produce a
gain in weight, the diet of individuals
belonging to the slender
type should be composed of easily
digested foods, which can be utilized
by the body with a m inim um
of effort; and it should include
generous amounts of concentrated
and highly nourishing foods.
Included in this classification
are eggs, cheese, cream, butter
or margarine, bacon, bread, cereals,
cream soups, custards, ice
cream, rice and tapioca puddings.
The addition of two or three
glasses of m ilk to the regular
meals will be found useful in
increasing the fuel value of the
