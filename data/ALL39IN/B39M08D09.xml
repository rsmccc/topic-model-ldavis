convenience and changes the operation o f going after your mail or handing
it out as the case may be 
The operation of moving from the
former location the McDonald building
less than a block distant on First
street to the new building was accomplished
without disturbing the
routine o f the office to any great ex
tent Thursday afternoon mail waj
distributed at the old postoffice anc
Friday s at the new one Although
it will be some time b efore all the
equipm ent is in and everything ship
shape in the new building the force
has made a w onderful start and the
office is operating with comparative
smoothness 
The new postoffice is a beautiful
building o f cream brick and Bedforc
stone with a wide flight o f steps leading

concrete drive 16 feet wide The
grounds w ere fixed and a lawn planted
ju st after Memorial day It is ir
fine condition now Plans are undei
w ay fo r landscaping it which will add
still more to the attractiveness o f the
corner A flag pole stands on the
northeast corner o f the grounds 
The interior o f the building is well
lighted and with the many windows
and skylight it will be possible to
carry on the work o f the office b

There is a full basement under the
building all parts o f which are planned
fo r use There is a large lobby 
with Postmaster D ickey s office to the

There is a mail box outside the
office from which the last night collection
will be taken at 9 30 p m

advice to the public Visit the new
postoffice and see how really fine it

from California containing a more
detailed account o f the sad death o f
their 18 year old son Ernest Rolland 
Mr Varnum is with the California
fish and game commission and had
been stationed at Camp Richardson 
A card from them to Mrs Tollack announced
that they were leaving Sunday
m orning fo r Independence California 
Apparently news o f their
son s injury awaited them on their arrival
and they im mediately drove the
600 miles back to Yreka only to find
he had passed away before their arrival 
The young man suffered a
com plete paralysis from the neck
dow n as the result o f striking a big
stone when diving while swimming in
the river with a group o f friends
Sunday afternoon He was immediately
rushed to the Siskiyou County
hospital where he remained conscious

A great many people have admired
the beautiful petunia hedge bordering
the drive at the N S Samdahl

now and has been almost all summer 
The plants w ere set out in bloom
early in the season and have never
faltered in their stride Mr Samdahl
counted as many as 150 blossoms
on one plant The long petunia hedge
is ju st over the wall bordering the
drive and under the protecting w ing
o f the spirea hedge that has been
there fo r a goe d many years The
blossoms are all a deep pink A row
o f blue m orning glories decorate the
south end o f the garage at the end
o f the drive and a row o f salvia describes
another part circle around
back o f the house The place has
certainly been a colorfu l spot to the
travelers going up Harrison street and
it is giving a great deal o f pleasure

It was with happy hearts and great
anticipation that the campers arrived
at Trempealeau Valley July 26 fo r
the third summer camp session o f the
Taylor Parish camp 
W hen it was all over with on the
follow ing Sunday all looked back
over the five days with pride and
fond memories o f a very successful
camp 
W hen the classes opened W ednesday
morning about 90 registered
members were in the two divisions 
ju n ior and senior 
The junior session something new
in Bible camps proved itself very
valuable under the fine leadership anil
teaching o f Margaret Wall Eide
( Better League Manual L ife
Choices e tc ) anel her husband Rev 
F Eide a successful pastor in Ostrander 
Minn Mrs Eide also taught
a senior class and endeared herself
to all who attended these sessions 
A fter this first senior class on Christian
L ife Rev Bringle conducted a
study on sin and grace based on
booklets o f Bible verses Following
the second period was the much anticipated
study o f St Paul very e ffectively
delivered by that ever belover
man N N Ronning (editor o f
 The Friend e tc ) o f Minneapolis 
The classes were very inspirational
and interesting It was discovered
that a force had to be used in getting
the campers to attend them 
A t the end o f the first day the
registrar and treasurer Verna Berg
and Lylah Johnson announced the
registration at about a hundred including
campers from Ostrander 
Minn Blair Chester Iowa Grand
Meadow Minn Spring Valley Minn 
Lime Springs Iowa Galesville Trem pealeau 
Wabasha Minn and o f
course the Taylor parish o f fou r congregations 
The group accom panying
the Eides added a fine spirit to
the campers both as new campers
and as new friends 
Thursday evening spelled excitement
in wet letters but despite the
heavy rain no one drowned nor contracted
any serious cold 
By Friday the registrating and visitors
amounted to around 175 making
it necessary to set extra tables in
the aud torium o f the church basement 
On Saturday began the five point
camp climax beginning in the evening
wTith the camp banquet and ending
Sunday afternoon with a camp
concert 
The banquet another new camp
feature lasted about 2Z hours and
every one present enjoyed a luxurious
meal in luxurious style TTie decorating
committee planned the tables
with candles and oak leaf decorations 
while the male serving staff
dressed in green and orange and under
the supervision o f Rev Eide 
served the guests most effectively 
Special banquet guests were members
o f W aldorf College quartet o f
Iowa who after the meal gave a
w onderful concert fo r the public in
the main auditorium 
Sunday communion at 7 a m was
point 3 in this climax follow ed by
grand worship and camp chorus con cert 
Rev Eide who was in charge
o f the camp chorus and speaker at
evening vespers delivered a very
forcefu l sermon at Sunday morning
worship 
Every one considered it a high
privilege to be able to hear the W ad
o rf quartet fou r times These fine
college lads sang at the banquet 
gave their concert sang at the Saturday
night bonfire and again at
church Sunday morning 
With reluctance the campers packed
for their homes Sunday afternoon 
some to go a few miles while others
to go 200 or more 
Many improvements were made
over last year on the camp site directly
across from the old historic
Trempealeau Valley church as well
as in recreation lines The swimming
w as decidedly better than before
and a new substantial footbridge
was newly constructed near the river
footbridge A lfred W aller who was
canteen manager assisted Raymond
Anderson the recreational director 
in life guarding A dandy ping pong
table was obtained by the ever busy
camp manager Jerome Hanson This
table was always busy A little eating
place was roped off on the north
wall o f the canteen giving the campus
the impression o f a high class
camp 
Joseph Lien Melrose acted as dean
o f men for his third consecutive
year while Lilyan Stensley o f Mt
Horeb was the girls guardian The
biggest part o f the afternoon was recreation
and swimming and supper
promised the daily gossip edited by
Ralph Loken and Paul Sutton in the
 Trempealeau Trum pe 
So many outstanding things will
always be remembered by those attending
this year s camp For instance 
the presence o f littl Ruth
E id e the movies taken by Dr Sm ith 
the wonderful and substantial meals
provided by the T V Ladies A idthe
fellowship and Christian fun raturally
com ing from associating with
such people as the Eides N N Ronning 
e tc the gracious and captivating
humor always provided by Ronning
in his classes and other places 
such as at the banquet in his duty o f
toastmaster U nforgettable also will
be the camp fires and splendid camp
songs 
All the cempers will openly and
erladly agree that there is nothing like
srood clean Christian fellowship 
With the faculty we also agree that
Christianity isn t a religion with a
long face but a happy joy fu l jou rney
with Christ awaiting fo r us at
the station when we get there 
See you in the bigger and finer
r V Bible Camp o f 1940!

Feeling was running a temperature
at the fair grounds last Sunday night
when the Merchants w ere out to plaster
as vigorous a shellacking as their
ability and the fates would allow on
the W hitehall Cubs in return fo r the
3 to 2 beating the Black River Falls
team took at Whitehall earlier in the
season It was the rubber game o f
the season and was taken easily by
8 to 1 Whitehall as usual displayed
enough talent with the w oodwork at
the dish but again as usual looked
like anything but a snappy fielding
ball club on defense Mattson starting
hurler fo r the Cubs was good
enough except fo r a streak o f w ildness
in the first until he retired under
a barrage o f basehits in the sixth 
Van Sickle finished and did fairly
well fo r the last two and two thirds
innings 
Rudolph kept all but two o f the 6
visitors hits scattered and allowed only
fou r bingles after the first fram e 
The pair o f hits by Hagen and D 
W right the form er s being a double
to left resulted in the lonely run
scored by Whitehall in the opening
canto 
The Merchants retaliated to W hitehall s
unruliness in the first by bunching
a trio o f passes and Hauser s single
while the enemy was kicking the
ball around afield until three had
scurried across the dish Nothing o f
importance happened thereafter until
the sixth at which time the Black River
men got busy in earnest and shelled
Mattson o f f the turret with a trio
o f hits and a pass Van Sickle replaced
Mattson but didn t get the inning
cleaned up until fou r Merchants
had spiked the plate The locals added
a single tally just fo r good measure
in the seventh on a hit by Hoard a
pass to Hauser and a sacrifice plus a
passed ball This was the fifth earned
run with a Falls tag 
Mr Dale Hauser who has long since
established a reputation as a slicker
around the initial bag had a very
large evening fo r him self Sunday by
conducting him self as an expert at the
bag executing the prize play o f the
show on a swell catch o f a tall foul 
getting a base on balls and topping
o f f all this stu ff with three scorching
singles to right fo r a p erfect ball
game from any angle o f approach 
Those who think that the w rong handed
first sacker can t hit might be reminded
that Dale has a swatting average
o f 313 fo r the season 
Tw o o f the Whitehall gemts were
pests with the mace v iz Don W right 
the restaurateur and Hagen both o f
whom collected a duo o f hits and com bined
to avert a whitewash by caging
a run in the first 
R udy s record fo r the evening was
17 strike outs no passes and only six
well scattered hits But despite all
this we will select Hauser as the top
perform er o f the cerem ony 
A nother feature game is on the
docket fo r Thursday o f this week 
The Piney W oods Brown Cubs will
try holds with the Merchants under
the lights beginning at 8 30 This
club has always managed to give Ernie s
aggregation a good ball game
and usually the victor had only a
single run margin besides the com edy
the colored youths reel o f f helps to
com plete a perfect exhibition Sunday
night Cashton one o f the stronger
semi pro teams will perform before
the local baseball bugs also at 8 30

Little E m ie Rudolph who likes his
com petition as big and as tough as
they come had an opportunity to display
his pitching wares to a packed
house and the Crookston Pirates at
the fair grounds here last Thursday
night The guys and gals were highly
pleased with the M erchant hurler s
perform ance The Buccaneers from
Minnesota not only w eren t happy
over the show but were no end chagrined
at the futility o f their work
with the bludgeon So effective was
Rudolph s work that no less than 19
o f the Northern Leaguers were set
down on their quota o f strikes Five
o f the enemy managed to garner base
noks and a pair trod the baselines in
lieu o f fielding miscues The errors
and the quint o f hits represented the
sum o f the Crookston attack fo r the
game None walked Tw o o f the blows
one a homer by Rolandson and the
other a double which snapped a picket
o f f the fence in right and was propelled
o f f the club o f Turck were
really well hit balls and served to remind
the dear people just what might
happen if a less able moundsman than
Rudy Rudolph were handling the
pitching chores The score was 3 to
2 
The entire Black River attack was
concentrated in the first fram e and
at the time it began to appear as if
the show would be just another
by the Merchants It wasn t long however 
before the game settled down
to a brilliant duel between big fireballer
Savage and Little Fireballer
Rudolph Savage was lifted fo r a
pinch hitter in the seventh and Sowada
finished 
Randles opened the low er h alf o f
the opening bracket by drawing a
free ticket to first Kleven fouled to
Rolandson Randles meanwhile going
to second on a wild pitch Teeples
slashed a line hit to le ft sending W ard
around Art Rudolph bashed a ball o f f
M cGrath s shins which sent Bob to
third and gave the Slugger a life
at first Ellisom walked filling the
bases E Rudolph coaxed a pass from
Savage forcin g Teeples to score 
Hoard was struck out on a fum ble by
Umps Y oung but Nereng drew the
fourth walk o f the chapter forcin g in
the third run o f the inning and the
second pushover tally thereby getting
him self credit fo r batting the winning
run o f the ball game over the pay
office 
Rolandson Pirate backstop and
property o f the Minneapolis Millers 
layed the proverbial ash on the pill
with plenty o f pow er in the fourth 
The hosshide came to rest somewhere
beyond the fence in le ft and Mr Rolandson
loped around the bases to the
plaudits o f the fair m inded fans not
to say the groans o f the others The
3 to 1 count prevailed until the seventh
when Mason scratched a hit to
short went to second on a slightlv
wild peg by Hoard who tried to pick
o f f the runner with a quick throw If
R oyce s throw had been accurate Mason
would have beem trapped by six
feet It was a smart play but so hurried
as to make accuracy difficu lt 
Bender struck out but Hawk laced a
double to center and Mason raced on
home Sowada lifted a pop fly to Nereng
in right and McGrath was em balmed
with strikes And that s the
tale o f the cannonading by the enemy 
V
In three o f the nine times the visiting
Pirates came to bat E m ie set the
side down on strikes In fou r other
occasions tw o swatsmen died on
strikes and one was w hiffed in each
o f the other tw o chapters A right
noble piece o f work we call it and the
Merchant follow ers w ere properly
proud o f their hurler and his ball
team 
Fortunately or unfortunately the
slump which has came over the Falls
stickwork still jinxed the Merchants
in the Crookston game although due
credit must be given to Savage and
Sowada Aside from Teeples ringing
hit in the first only two other men
got on the lanes with bingles E m ie
placed a cherry on his heroical sundae
by pasting out the second local
hit in the sixth and Hauser beside
doing a lot o f classic first basing added
to his laurels by getting him self
the third and final M erchant bingle
in the seventh And so another big
ball game passes into the records

M anager Len Ellison invited the
Merchants to invade the Blair ball
grounds fo r an afternoon tussle last
Sunday afternoon and it wasn t long
before Len ( if he hoped fo r a win
fo r his charges found out he made a
mistake) in fact a 6 to 2 mistake 
which was the margin o f the fou rteenth
victory o f the season fo r the
Black River Falls nine Chucker Shaw
gathered his third win o f the season
by scattering eleven swedish hits and
bearing down effectively in all except
one spot the eighth when a triple by
Truax a pass to Skipper Ellison and
a double by Uncle Charley Hebert
were good fo r the pair o f tallies counted
by the Blaironians 
The Merchants scored in the second
on hits by Hoard Hauser and Neidfeldt 
Tw o more were added in the
fourth on Ellison s error hits by Art
Ruolph and Hoard and passes to
Hoagenson and Shaw Another span
o f runs came as the result o f a tremendous
triple to left by Teeples in
the fourth follow ed by successive bingles
by A Rudolph and Hoard A
last tally was counted in the seventh
on K leven s hit and stolen base a
ju ggle by Nereng and a fly ball o f f
H oard s bat which Redsteen pulled
down somewhere around North Dakota 
Because we have three box scores
this week we will forego a detailed
account o f this ball game and simply
mention that beside the fine twirling
by Shaw the features o f the fray lay
in the hitting o f Hoard and A Rudolph 
H onorable mention also might
be given to Teeples who pasted the
pill fo r what should have been an
easy home run but which got held up
by the wind and vegetation in left
field The drive would have cleared
the fair ground fence under normal
conditions by at least fifty feet

Large business from small endeav
ors grow And who knows but the
young sons o f Mr and Mrs John A nger
may one day becom e the owners
o f a large trailer business They have
a good start F or several days past
they have been putting together sev
eral empty crates and other pieces o f
lum ber and have built a trailer house
on a small two wheeled wagon Entrance
is made by a side door and on
entering one may be seated on a
front or rear seat The trailer is pro
pelled by boy pow er seated in another
wagon to which the trailer is
attached W e looked fo r a name on
the trailer but maybe as yet they
have not decided on the right name 
Anyhow it s good 
Some time ago the city officials
took concerted action in making the
village dumping grounds a little more
respectable looking It s about time
again to call the attention o f the public 
the officials as well that it is
again getting back to where it was
in the beginning Those who dump
garbage are using the w rong place to
 dum p and it is again getting so
that it s hard to put the refuse just
where it should be A little more
attention on the part o f everybody
using the dump will make it a lot
better And that isn t all one can
tell from the kind o f dum ping just
about who is guilty Those interested
should go there and look it over 
Miss Marie Evert o f Ettrick who
is cam ping with a group o f girls from
that vicinity at Hatfield was in to see
Dr Boxer last Friday It seems that
the girls found a small kitten who
was acting rather queerly and Miss
Evert picked it up and discovered a
fish hook in its tongue In endeavoring
to get the hook out the young
lady was most severely scratched
about both hands which required the
services o f the doctor to sooth the
scratches and to be sure there was no
blood poisoning She got the hook out
all right and it is presumed that there
is one grateful kitten It s just like
the story o f long ago about the lion
and the sliver

The thanks o f the whole community
should go out to all o f those who
were at the church last Friday in
answer to the call to service It is
believed by some that never before
has the work o f cleaning the church
gone so smoothly and much credit
should go to the officers and members
o f the various church organizations
who cooperated together so
nicely fo r the good o f all 
Since the church is a place that is
used by all in life as well as in
death it should be cared fo r reverently 
diligently and wholeheartedly
by all and it was in that spirit that
nearly 25 people gathered to obey
heaven s laws o f order and cleanliness

that w ork does not need to becom
e a drudgery fo r all labored in
a most harmonious and joyous way

The House o f Representatives declined
to even consider the President s
Spending Lending Bill even
as reduced and drastically amended
in committee The action was not altogether
unprecedented as it has occurred
previously generally in the
case o f measures o f m inor import
ance but seldom has it happened
with a measure which had becom e a
national issue Generally the very
prominence o f m ajor measures impels
a hearing and consideration even
though defeat may follow Conse
quently when the House declined by
a vote o f 193 to 166 to perm it the
Spending Bill to com e before it it
established rather a remarkable precedent 
Had the bill been taken up with
the antagonism apparent probably it
would have been further amended 
and then defeated by even a larger
vote Many members believe that
measures o f such importance should
at least be considered and finally
acted upon even though they may
not be in accord with the proposed
legislation By perem ptorily declining
consideration the House killed
the bill The Senate bill also greatly
changed still is before the House 
but after the action taken on its own
measure there is small likelihood o f
it being brought up 
The original spending lending bill
submitted by the President was so
changed by the Senate and House
committees that it carried only the
general features o f the recom mendations 
The amounts w ere reduced by
one third or more The toll road provision 
fo r instance was totally eliminated
by both committees So also
were the revolving fu nd features
which would have served to make the
plan perpetual With the reductions
in amounts the greater part o f the
expenditures would have gone to
farm legislation including additional
funds fo r the Farm Security Adm inistration
and Rural Electrification 
Public W orks loans and equipment
loans fo r railways other features o f
the bill w ere reduced in amount 
An amendment inserted in the Senate
bill and unanimously recom mended
by the House com m ittee would
have largely stopped the flood o f
foreclosures o f farm mortgages 
which has been adding immeasurably
to the difficulties o f the farm ing section 
K illing the bill also defeated
that amendment along with the rest 
Further action to prevent foreclosures
on farm s now will have to go
over until the next session In the
meantime probably 2 0 0 0 0 more
farm foreclosure actions will be instituted
and farm distress further aggravated 
That Congress should consider adjournm
ent with so many important
problems unsolved seems neither right
nor just I f nothing more than the
farm debt question were to be taken
up it would be well worth while The
foreclosures on farms have proceeded
without interruption fo r more
than a decade It is claimed that
farm mortgage debts have been reduced
by m ore than one billion dollars
in the past five years but the
main part o f that reduction has been
accomplished by transfer o f farm
ownership from mortgaged farmers
to m ortgagees and others with consequent
increase o f farm tenancy 
which now is recognized as a national
problem The Federal Land Banks
have taken over m ore than 96 000
farms by such proceedings in the past
15 years and still holds about 25 000
o f them A t present the Land Banks
and large insurance com panies are
holding farm s on which they had
loans o f about one billion dollars 
The normal value o f such holdings
was twice o r three times as much 
Compared with farm values the
m ortgage debt on farm s now is at
least 30 per cent higher than at its
peak Compared with the value o f
farm incom e and prices fo r farm
products it has been nearly doubled
instead o f reduced There is no
greater national problem pending
than that o f farm indebtedness Congress
will be compelled to recognize
that fact 
Immediately follow ing the expiration
o f the Spending Lending Bill 
the House took up the Panama Canal
bill desired particularly by the Navy
Departm ent as a part o f the program
fo r national defense a program which
has been especially popular in Congress
at this session involving even
larger spending than that proposed in
the Spending Lending Bill That bill
provides fo r the building o f additional
locks on the Panama Canal at an
ultimate cost o f $277 000 000 or
about one half the original cost o f
the canal 
These locks will not be com pleted
fo r at least ten years It is urged
that in case o f war the present locks
might be put out o f commission by
bombs dropped from enem y planes 
rendering the canal useless to the
Navy Possibly that might happen 
but why such enem y planes would
drop bombs on one set o f locks and
not spare a few bom bs to put out the
new locks on the same raid is not so
apparent to folks who do not know
the ways o f war But the House
passed the canal bill by a decisive
vote without even the opposition o f
some o f those who are inclined to believe
that governm ent expenditures
are o f greater menace to our nation
than any threat o f foreign w ar now
being made On the day after this
action another thirteen million dollars
w ere voted fo r the Arm y and
Navy fo r items overlooked when the
regular appropriation bill was passed 
with authorization o f $43 000 000
more fo r arm y and navy purposes 
to be provided fo r in future bills 
The House by a narrow vote turned
down an appropriation o f $119 
0 0 0 0 0 0 to stabilize wheat and corn
prices in the face o f bumper crops
anticipated this year The government
has loans on 257 000 000 bushels
o f last year s corn crop which the
Agricultural Department desires to
continue to prevent the big surplus
from driving corn prices to still low er
levels The Secretary o f Agriculture
advised that unless that was done

Friday was fish day in very truth
around here due to an unusual catch
made in Black river There is a little
curtain o f mystery hung around
the source o f the fish but the fish
itself was authentic enough It must
have been among the residents o f the
city fo r a spell too if there is any
truth in the old adage about fish
and com pany smell after three days 
The specimen was displayed in the
fire hall The head has been rem oved
from the body and is standing in
a pail o f salt water so it may still
be seen A constant stream o f visitors
viewed the fish during the first
day or so and it was a fine topic o f
conversation I f nothing else it has
taught us natives quite a bit about
fish we never knew before I f you
step in now to see it that is not a
beaver s tail sticking out o f that galvanized
pail but the nose o f our fish
friend 
It has been classified as a paddle
fish o f which there are only two
known species one in the low er Mississippi
and its tributaries and the
other in China It grow s as big as
150 pounds The flesh is edible How
 t got in our water sis a mystery just
as it is how it got out
