 Merlin Hull of Black River Falls is a member of a newly formed unofficial committee of congressmen who are studying freight •rate discriminations and will present their findings and a program of action to the Interstate and Foreign Commerce committee
 Chairman of the committee is Rep
 Ramspeck of Georgia
 The other states represented are Arkansas Nebraska Washington California Kansas Texas Oklahoma Minnesota Missouri South Dakota Tennessee Iowa Louisiana North Carolina Virginia and Oregon
 Most of the discriminatory rates date from the early days of the rail roads Rep
 Hull said
 The states east of the Mississippi and north of the Potomac with the exception of Wisconsin have the cheapest rates in the country
 In Wisconsin the rates are four to seven per cent higher than in the eastern states
 The result has been Hull pointed out that many industries have failed or been driven out of the state and new industries discouraged from settling there
 Proof of the difference in rates is found in the fact that Wisconsin businesses find it cheaper when shipping to the west coast to send their freight by way of New York or Massachusetts HuH said
 Several bills have appeared before both house and senate attempting in different ways to meet this problem Hull said
 The purpose of the committee is to correlate the efforts of interested congressmen and to study the question thoroughly with extensive hearings
 The committee will report to a larger conference of interested members who are expected to support its action

 COMMON SENSE CO N SERVATIO N By L
 H
 King ston The state legislature now in session is soon going to consider a proposal to reduce Wisconsin s non resident fishing license fee so that Wisconsin s tourist industry may compete on an equal basis with Michigan s and Minnesota s
 In previous articles this column has proposed a law retaining our sresent seasonal non resident fishing license at $3
00 but a lowing a ten day fishing license for tourists at $1
00 ; providing however that the resulting loss of conservation revenues be replaced by an appropriation out of general state funds
 This could easily be done by writing into this proposed law a stipulation to the effect that for each 10 day fishing permit sold two dollars will be credited to conservation funds out of general state funds
 Each year tourists leave from 150 to 250 million dollars of cash inside Wisconsin s boundaries
 The business enterprises who benefit directly from this cash income are gas stations bus lines railroads hotels sport goods stores taverns restaurants summer resorts and many others
 Businessmen will of course be in favor of reducing non resident fishing license fees to increase tourist revenues
 What helps business helps everybody is their slogan
 But business itself has never yet directly contributed one cent toward conservation in this state whereas the bulk of conservation funds have come from Wisconsin fishermen and hunters
 Is it fair to expect sportsmen to pay the freight for Wisconsin s second largest industry? I think that the 500 000 licensed hunters and anglers in this state will agree unanimously that No is the answer
 Fishermen and hunters have financed Wisconsin s tourist business and the state park system long enough it s time for those who receive the benefits to kick in

888 863 2592 CI € ORIOLE PER SO N ALITY Tuesday Jan
 24 at 2 o clock the Junior and Senior High school classes were called to the gym to hear Mr Donaldson of the State Teachers College of Eau Claire talk on personality
 He gave examples of habits which mar our personality
 Some of them are: 1
 Spitting— especially on the floor 2
 Girls applying make up in public
 3
 Boys not using their handkerchiefs
 4
 Improper use of toothpicks
 5
 Do not clean your fingernails in public
 6
 Last but not least— poor English After this talk and many good laughs Mr Johnson announced that school was dismissed for the day
 INTRODUCING Miss Thomasgard our newest faculty member began her Black River Falls career on Monday January 23
 Her first impression of Black River Falls in general and our school in special is that it seems bigger and more citified after having taught in Cadott a smaller town than ours
 She finds her student body kind helpful and cooperative
 As class advisor for the 7th grade she has already ambitious notions for them
 This class she says must make for itself a good reputation as it is just launching on its high school career
 Miss Thomasgard also teaches Senior and eighth grade English and French II
 Our new English teacher was she says much amused because her picture must it seemed immediately be taken
 Quoting Miss Thomasgard In sports I like everything outdoors and have my skates along 
 I am awaiting the first Black River Falls basket ball game I am to see
 So Miss Thomasgard is welcomed and hopes for a pleasant term are extended

 FALLS VS M ONDOVI Black River Falls defeated Mondovi 17 to 11 in a rough and tumble game Tuesday evening Jan
 24 at Mondovi
 Black River overcame a one point lead at the first quarter and held a considerable lead until the whistle blew at the end of the game
 The scoring was pretty even among the players on both sides
 Horswill made a total of 5 points with Northup and Upton tailing with 4 apiece
 R
 Cook was high point man from Mondovi with 4 points to his credit
 So it is oblivious that no man dominated the court
 Judging by the number of fouls which was six against Black River and three against Mondovi one would imagine it was a peaceful game but far from it
 In the 4th quarter the game became a free for all with men down on the floor much of the time
 The score at the first quarter was 6 to 7 in Mondovis favor but Black River held them scoreless duping the 2d quarter and at the half the score board read 12 to 6 in B
 R
 s favor
 During the third quarter Casey made two points for Mondovi on free throws and Northup and Horswill sunk two baskets for Black River making the score 16 to 8
 Then came the quarter with the foot ball tactics 
 Out of the mix up Mondovi made three points and Northup taking advantage of a technical foul scored the only point for Black River during the 4th quarter making the final score 17 to 11
 Black River was hard pressed during the last minutes and was unable to get the ball down the floor due to Mondovi s rushing HONOR ROLL Seventh Grade: High Honor Roll 3rd six weeks— Mary Ellen Bichler Mary Joyce Gilbertson Alice Ibinger Norma Thiele Iris Thomas Carmen Wright

 Puff Pant Prom The Homeroom giris have decided to put on a Puff Pant Prom for the We ve learned the need of a word of We think this poem will be especially well adapted to the feelings of some people as long as the semester tests are over
 A Lesson o f School So you failed in your class my lad? You couldn t quite make the mark? You failed— and you feel so blue and sad And all the world looks dark
 You lost and your heart is sore And you wish you could go and cry Well let us not worry a minute more Or give it another sigh
 You failed and you stand in fear Of the things that the boys will say Why there isn t a boy who is worth a tear But who knows he may fail some day
 For it isn t to win that s good And it isn t the head held high But to know that you did the best you could
 And the best we can do is try
 You failed and you know how sad Were the ones who have failed before; And what did you say to them my lad When you knew that their hearts were sore? Did you come to them near and near With a kindly word and a smile And bid them dry that very tear That came to after a while
 Ah yes— you didn t know What it meant to the ones who lost; And maybe you said some boy was slow And you didn t count the cost Of the sorrow it was to him When he heard what his fellows said But you know it now when your eyes are dim
 And the sorrow is yours instead
 So lad we have failed maybe
 And the other boys may pass But we ve found a lesson for you and and me That s finer that one in class; 15 have a perfect record for six weeks
 This is a good month to display our art we are making Lincoln s and Washington s silhouettes and have valentines to make yet

 BooUti MERLIN H ULL S LE T T E R While much is being said about our country minding its own business and keeping out of at least some of the difficulties which beset the world al3o there is a lot of propaganda favorable to spreading our own business over the world so that we shall have that much more territory to cover in order to mind it
 One big advantage in minding our own business without spreading it all over the earth is that we might keep our money at home use our energies in developing our own resources and not keep on losing both by playing policeman teacher nurse and banker to the many countries which are so constantly trying to get hold of our money
 Among the latest proposals to enlarge our sphere of influence commercially and politically in South America is that of organizing to promote tourist travel to South America
 It seems to have the same sponsors as those back of a trunk line highway between the two continents
 If anybody wants to tour South America by car over highways as difficult as some of those in our country it is their particular busi ness
 It is safe to say that more tourists may go from our country than are likely to come here from south of Panama
 But there are millions of our own people who have not seen America and before boosting foreign expeditions it would be better to keep our tourists and their money at home
 Promoting international solidarity may be a good theme for our statesmen who aided the bankers in loanin~ billions abroad but little of whic has come back or ever will come back but our government can find many better ideas in promoting recovery here at home instead of trying to boom the tourist trade of Paraguay and Uraguay among other countries
 It now seems certain after a long wait of four years that the Townsend bill will be brought to a hearing before the Ways and Means Committee
 The hearing probably will follow that on the administration s proposed amendments to the Social Security Act some time in February
 Other ©ld age pension plans may also be taken up by the committee during the month
 The proposed amendments to the Social Security act will have the backing of administration leaders with the possibility of a party division which may be of formidable proportions as criticism of that act and its 50 billion dollar trust fund is becoming stronger
 The administration leaders will oppose the Townsend plan as they have done from the start but the list of those who believe it should be given a hearing and v a vote in the House seems to be much larger than in the last Congress
 The new Townsend bill follows closely the general outline of the General Welfare bill in the previous congress
 It does not provide a pension of $200 per month or any other fixed amount
 It proposes a general transaction tax of 2 per cent the revenues from which would be apportioned among those who would come under its provisions
 The amount of monthly pension each would receive would depend upon the aggregate of the taxes taken in
 In the last congress 138 members signed up to force action oin the bill
 There are over 100 new members in this congress many o f whom were committed to taking up the Townsend bill and the Townsend headquarters list 98 Republicans among those who are expected to aid in obtaining a hearing and a vote on the bill and nearly as many more members of other parties
 The Department of Agriculture is advised that farmers in the corn belt are holding their corn crops to an extent that may increase the price
 Speculators have done that frequently when conditions were favorable
 The farmers obtain a loan of 57 cents per bushel from the Commodity Credit Corporation with which to store their corn
 About $54 000 000 has been put out on such loans but now it is estimated that another hundred millions may be called for and total holdings may amount to 400 million bushels before another corn crop is harvested
 But not all com farmers are eligible to obtain such loans which are not available to those without the restricted areas of the corn b lt
 It is alleged that many farmers who are borrowing so heavily oin their own corn crops are therefore buying com of others at a price below the loan value to feed their stock
 If the charges are well founded apparently the loan policy is working to the advantage of the corn belt farmers and to the disadvantage o f others
 The loans on com are relatively small compared with those on cotton of which the government now holds eleven million bales at a cost of $541 000 000 with interest and storage costs to be added
 Foreign trade specialists are publishing statements showing that our exports exceeded our imports by over a billion dollars in 1938
 Such figures should be accompanied by statements explanatory of the invoice values put upon imports
 Goods and farm products imported from countries of cheaper production are valued upon foreign invoices and not upon their value placed upon them in the markets here
 Silk made in Japan comes here under Japanese valuations in that country and though it sells for many times that value here it still goes into foreign trade reports at the price put upon it abroad
 And so with shoes coming in from Europe
 They are sold as imported goods and displace shoes made here at a much higher cost price
 There may have been a great amount o f our goods sold abroad which are computed on the American invoices but were many of our imports reported upon their displacement value instead of foreign values the actual balance in trade might not have been so great
 It is another instance in which departmental reports are confusing as to the real effects o f foreign trade I ED W A R D OLSON Edward Olson died Wednesday morning January 25 1939 as the result of injuries received Sunday at his home in Squaw Creek when he was kicked in the head by a horse which was running loose and the tracks in the snow furnished the evidence of how the accident had happened
 It was one of the older horses on the farm and one which he had always handled
 He was found by his son Floyd crawling on his hands and knees from the scene of the accident
 He was immediately i brought to the hospital but he never ! regained consciousness until the i time of his death Wednesday morning

 GOING ST RAIG H T A H E A D Is the motorist in greatest ganger when making a left or a right turn when gaing straight ahead when slowing down or stopping or when he is parked? State Highway commission records show that in 1938 four out of five drivers who were involved in automobile crashes when going straight ahead when the unexpected happened— collision with a pedestrian a motor vehicle or some obstruction in the street or on the highway
 Going straight ahead includes rounding a curve going over a hill crossing an intersection and moving on a straghtaway
 Death claimed 254 persons last year in traffic accidents where the driver was on a straight stretch of road 145 on curves and hills and 114 at intersections

 not from our own standpoint that should be done
 But there s another angle
 Japan has been fortifying its islands not far distant from Guam
 However the Japanese government has become violent over the matter and protest* our arming Guam while its official press warns that in case we do Japan will sink our navy
 Just as though we have become so decadent that Japan can order us to do what we may deem best with our own island in which Japan has not a particle of interest
 Whether or not Guam shall be fortified is purely our  I own business and none of Japan s
 If The Isle of Guam is some 3 000 we should stop buying Japanese silks miles from our Pacific coast and about 1600 miles from Japan and it is owned by this country
 It has been proposed to Congress that we should fortify the island and establish a naval base there at a cost of millions

 H EM M Y W RITES The third week has slipped by and practically nothing has been accomplished regarding legislation
 Apparently the controlling forces are waiting for the introduction of the Budget Bill and then it is hoped that the legislative grind will be in full swing
 One resolution urging the President to reconsider the appointment of Thomas Amlie as commissioner of Commerce was adopted by a merger of the Republicans and Democrats
 Among the bills introduced of interest are a bill to reenact the socalled Code Law but under the differset up
 Under the proposed bill the administration of the codes would be by the Industrial Commission
 Other bills of interest are the repeal of the teachers tenure law; also the increase of old age benefits to $60 per month reduction of automobile licenses redistribution of highway funds extension of time for payment of taxes continuation of the moratorium law and speed limit for automobiles
 In all about 250 bills are already introduced in both houses of the legislature

 C O O P E R A T IV E NEW S Earl Horswill Governor Heil has proclaimed February 20th to 24th as co operative week the proclamation is in part as follows: And urges the citizens of this state to avail themselves of the opportunities provided during these five days by special radio programs newspaper articles and otherwise to learn more of the spirit and principle as well as the aims and accomplishments of co operation
 All community clubs and discussion groups throughout the county should plan on holding a meeting during cooperative week and confine it to the study o f co operation
 Perhaps there is no phase of the co operative movement that is growing more rapidly or attracting more attention in recent months than the co operative medical societies
 Co operative medical service has the approval of the Medical Associations both state and national
 The National Health conference called by President Roosevelt found Uiat 31 000 000 people in the United States live in areas lacking in adequate hospital facilities and that thousands of people are dying each year from ailments that could be cured or prevented if adequate medical aid were provided

 KEROSENE DOES NOT BELON G N EAR STOVE The kerosene can doesn t deserve a place of honor in the kitchen altho this fuel oil furnishes the light in almost half of the farm homes of the Stanley A
 Witzel of the Wisconsin College of Agriculture explains that the safest place for kerosene is in the woodshed or some out of theway place where there will be no danger of an explosion from getting it too hot
 Then too if it is kept away from the stove there will be less temptation to use it for starting a fire quickly
 Getting a supply of dry kindling wood ready in the fall and using a little care in building the fire will make it unnecessary to use kerosene he remarks
 It may be poured over the wood many times without any harm but there is always the danger of a serious explosion if live coals are left in the stove
 Cleaning and filling the lamps at a regular time each morning is also important Witzel points out
 By making this a habit you can always be sure that the wicks are trimmed even and that there is enough kerosene in the lamp to last throughout the evening for filling the lamp after dark by the light of another lamp or an open fire is one of the greatest hazards
 A safe place especially reserved for the lamp is another of Witzel s suggestions
 If the lamp has its own special spot it won t accidently be set down too near a warm stove or in a place where curtains may blow over or against it
 When there are children in the family another precaution is to keep it out of their reach and never to place it on a table cloth that can be pulled down

 5th
 The Golden Text is taken from II Corinthians 3:17: Where the Spirit of the Lord is there is liberty
 The following citations from the Bible are included in the Lesson Sermon : F o r th ey that are a fter the flesh do m ind the things o f the fle s h ; but they that are a fter the Spirit the things o f the Spirit
 F or to be carnally m inded is d ea th ; but to be spiritually m inded is life and peace
 Because the carnal m ind is enm ity against G o d ; fo r it is n ot su bject to the law o f God neither indeed can be
 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God
 But ye are n ot in the flesh but in the Spirit if so be that the Spirit o f God dwell in you 
 And if Christ be in you the b od y is dead because o f s in ; but the S pirit is life because of righteousn ess (R om ans 8 :5  1 0 
 The Lesson Sermon includes the following correlative passages from the Christian Science textbook Science and Health With Key to The Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy: Divine Science reverses the false testim on y o f the m aterial senses and thus tears aw ay the fou n dation s o f error

 COMMITTEE BANK NIGHT TO CONTINUE A T L A CROSSE La Crosse Wis
— Two La Crosse juries have refused to class Bank nite a theatrical advertising stunt as a lottery
 Attorney General Martin has evidently ended the dispute as far as the state of Wisconsin is concerned by authorizing the dropping of the case pending before County Judge Roy Ahlstrom against the Rivoli Theatre in which it was charged the operation of Bank Nite constituted a nuisance 
 The nuisance case said to have been conceived as a means of getting the matter before the State Supreme Court for a final ruling was instigated by Attorney Vaudreuil Madison a deputy under recently defeated Attorney General Loomis the deputy having appeared as special prosecutor in one of the cases in which a jury held with the theatres
 As a result of the action of the Attorney General Bank Nite has been resumed at the Rivoli Theatre in La Crosse according to an announcement by Mr Frank L
 Koppelberger

 W ISCO N SIN S H EALTH (By Cornelius A
 Harper M
 D
 State Health Officer Webster defines nostrum as a medicine recommended by its preparer especially a medicine whose ingredients are kept secret
 The human being is a funny animal
 Knowledge comes hard to us and we are usually willing to believe that the other fellow knows more about a given subject than we do especially when he brings up the particular subject first and admits he s an expert
 True scientists alone are capable of distinguishing the real from the bogus that is in their particular field
 The best that any one can do outside of his own specialty to avoid being taken in time and again by false claims is to consult a person who knows
 Consider the field of nostrums or patent medicines
 There is no limit to the claims made for many of these products by their manufacturers
 Although there is to date no medicine that will remedy tuberculosis in the least degree yet in the long list of nostrums are scores of concoctions which are claimed to do this
 Likewise no medicine has yet been discovered that will repair a diseased liver or that will destroy cancer
 Internal ailments like these require the care of a duly trained and duly licensed physician or surgeon
 Most people know this but through the influences of such forces as wishful thinking fear of facing a present issue childish faith in the humanly impossible or economic distress they will pitiably attempt to regain their former health out of impressive bottles containing shattered hope in liquid form
 The day is approaching when our state and federal laws will go farther in protecting us from this cruellest form of exploitation
 Voted the best movie of the year by the dramatic critics of the nation

 The Forest Protection District No
 10 includes all of the townships in and east of Range 4 in Jackson county
 Mr Hilliker insists that there is a need for the establishment of a Forest Protection Organization List at an early date so that the public may be able to conveniently receive burning permits as soon as the snow is gone
 These burning permits which are required at all times except when the ground is covered with snow may be obtained from the emergency warden in the town in which you live or the Forest Rangers at District Headquarters Phone No
 294 Black River Falls or at the Ranger Station at Pray
 All townships in and west of Range 5 in Jackson county are in the Cooperative Forest Protection District
 The town chairmen of these towns are the emergency fire wardens
 Limited cooperative aids may be received from the Wisconsin Conservation Department by having your town chairman if you are a resident of the cooperative area contact the Central Forest Area Headquarters Phone 294 at Black River Falls
