BIGGARS STORE
ATTRACTS ATTENTION
The formal opening of Biggar s
store the former Marsh store attracted
visitors from far and near
and all who saw the store then and
have since seen it are full of praise
for the general effect achieved 
The picture accompanying this
article will give only a partial idea
o f the store as it now stands The
picture was taken from the northwest
A flight of wide steps lead into the corner and really shows only a little
building and are completed j over half of the building The mir 
The contract for the job was let j ror paneled pillars seen in the foreto
J S Sweitzer Son of St Paul ground are in the center of the store 
Nick Christianson is superintendent j In the rear may be seen the cash pit 
in charge of the work Sam Warm  which is stationed some little distance
oltz construction engineer for the from the back of the room It is oval
Treasury department is supervising
the work 
Just to give an idea of the business
that will be transacted in the new
postoffice when it begins to operate 
shaped with the red roof that cani
opies the west and south wall and
also covers the hat section which is
just to the left as you enter the store 
There is a general effect of more
space in the store and the white
walls red roofs which exactly match
the beautiful dress and coat cases on
the east wall which may be seen in
the picture give a different look than
usual to the store The left half o f
the store is carpeted in a deep blue
pile carpet which adds much to the
effect The show window floors are
both carpeted and the backgrounds
freshly decorated 
The day of the opening the store
was beautifully decorated with potted
plants and cut flowers and hundreds
o f red roses were given out to visitors

now in progress there Mrs Noble
had planned to leave for Beach and
had already completed arrangements
for her journey home when the sad
accident befell her The body was
shipped to Beach arriving here Wednesday 
Funeral services were conducted
yesterday afternoon at 2 :30 from the
Methodist church in the city and a
crowded building gave mute testimony
to the great esteem in which
this popular lady was held by every
one who enjoyed the pleasure of her
acquaintance Burial was made in
the Beach cemetery

CHOOSING
A BANK
Women do not customarily come out in
so many words and express even to themselves
just what it is that makes them
prefer one kind of service over another 
Often it may be the  little things  that
count most  small courtesies; patience
and consideration shown by those in the
bank; extra facilities provided for their
comfort and convenience; above all 
the general atmosphere of friendliness
and cooperation 
W e sincerely appreciate the patronage
of the women customers of this bank and
we are always willing to take extra
time or to put forth special efforts in
their behalf

another storm last Sunday added two
inches more A fter the big plows come

though these plows should also be

late as many roads were impassable

M AY LOSE M AIL SERVICE
The daily papers of February 28th
carried the item that  
The Green Bay and Western railroad
organized in 1872 as the Greer 
Bay and Lake Pepin road first to
join Lake Michigan and the Mississiippi
river at Winona soon will lose
its federal postoffice contract to handle
mail between Merrillan and Winona 
a stretch of 67 miles it was
learned today 
New arrangements will be made as
soon as a new carrier can be contracted 
The action has aroused a protest
along the line traversing the fertile
Trempealeau valley Business men
and civic clubs of Blair Alma Center 
Whitehall Independence and Arcadia
circulated petitions in a vain effort
to retain service 
The railroad found it impossible
to maintain regular passenger train
service and irregular delivery of mails
caused postal authorities to arrange
cancellation of the contract 
New bids for star route service are
to be opened April 1 covering service
from Merrillan to Winona on a three
hour schedule Old mail contracts
linking Green Bay and Winona are
not affected 
Officals of the road in this area
confirmed reports the Green Bay and
Western would now appeal to the
Wisconsin public service commission
for permission to discontinue passenger
service in the Trempealeau area
on the grounds it cannot operate at
a profit without the mail contract 
A Wednesday morning dispatch
states that:  
A fter conferring today with Green
Bay Western railroad officials concerning
repeal of their mail contract
through Trempealeau valley Frank
Shonfield of St Paul railway service
superintendent consented to deliberate
the issue further 
Shonfield s decision to   think
things over  indicated postal authorities
action calling for bids on star
route service would be postponed until
after April 1 the date originally
specified for opening of the bids 
G C Byers general manager of
the railroad said lack of passengers
caused irregular service and curtailed
schedules Valley postmasters have
protested the   railroad s late service 
according to Shonfield 
Authorities rescinding of the annual
 1 0 0 0 0 mail contract may result
in the railroad s complete curtailment
o f its passenger service on
the 67 mile line from Merrillan to
Winona Byers declared 
The proposal of star route service
has evinced protests from business
men and civic organizations of towns
in the Trempealeau region

Globe Trotters a team from Milwaukee 
two engagements with the B R

to give the local folks plenty of caging
entertainment there being scores
to settle with both the county seaters
and the strong Taylor aggregation 
We were not a witness to the Hixton

than a resume of the battle Nichols

A Message from Blair
Last week we received an issue o f
the Blair school paper It was several
pages long and very interesting 
We were especially interested because
we have started a school paper of our
own and by next year hope to exchange
it with other schools They
called their paper the   Cardinal  
and Glenn Hebert is the editor 
Merrillan D efeats Elk Mound
23 19 in Opener
B r r r goes the horn The game
has started Bones dribbled down the
floor a pass to Kenny a pass back to
Bones who gently but firmly tosses
it in the basket More passing is
done then Bones takes a long shot 
The whistle blew and Bones got a
free throw which he made 
Elk Mound makes a beautiful shot
and they also got two free throws
which were missed 
Then Bud gets the ball and makes
a beautiful shot from near the middle
o f the floor Time out is called
and the score is now 5 3 in Merrillan s

co operative associations in the United
States   What state has more farmer
members in Co operative business
organizations than it has farm opertors  
The answer is   Wisconsin 
These interesting facts were brot
out in a recent radio talk   Co operation  
Fact or Fancy    by Asher Hobson 
head of the department of agricultural
economics at the University
o f Wisconsin over state stations WHA
and WLBL He accounts for Wisconsin
having more co operative members
than there are farmers by explaining
that many farmers belong to
more than one co operative 
Wisconsin s lead in the co operative
movement Hobso n attributes to the
fact that dairy products lend themselves
so well to processing and marketing 
Between one third and onefourth
o f all co operatives among
farmers in the United States has to
do with dairy products It is estimated
that one third of all butter is manufacured
in co operative creameries 
and in Wisconsin probably over onehalf
o f the butter is made by co operatives 
Something like one fifth o f
the cheese of the United States is
made and marketed co operatively 
A fter dairying in order of their
co operative importance come grain
and livestock fruit and vegetables are
fourth and these four groups account
for three fourths of the farmers  cooperative
buying and selling business 
Hobson estimated that thirty per cent
o f the products sold from Wisconsin
farms passed through the hands of a
cooperative in some stage of its journey
fro mthe farmer to the retailer 
Other important facts reported
were that Wisconsin has nearly 1 100
co operative associations with more
than 215 000 members and that these
cooperatives do an annual business o f
 96 000 000 which is roughly speaking 
one twentieth of the total farmer
co operative business of the United
States 
Drug Clerk:   Just step into the
booth and tell the operator whom you
want  
Caller:   I did   but there s no operator
in there!     Ex

Styles change as to public expendi
tures just as in many other activities 
Some fifteen or more years ago 
funds flowed from the federal treas
ury by hundreds of millions in re
funds of income taxes especially as
to w ar  industries and war profits 
In all a billion or more was refund
ed in the course of six or eight years 
Refunds have been of lesser amounts
since the depression but last year
the amounts refunded exceeded twen
ty six millio ns 
The past few years expenditures
for relief have amounted to a dozen
billions and the end is not in sight
Not all the relief appropriations went
directly for that purpose Hundreds of
millions were set out of relief fund
for various special purposes includ
ing a tunnel under the Hudson river 
subways in Chicago and many projects
which Congress would not have
scantioned in direct legislation One
o f the largest of such special expenditures
o f funds allotted from the
general unemployment appropriations
were some six hundred millions o f
dollars awarded to the Army and
Navy for purposes which Congress
had failed to provide for in the regular
Army and Navy appropriation
bills Millions were spent for housing
and other buildings at Army posts
over the country and the Navy yards
came in for their share of the mill
ions for jiew buildings and other improvements 
In practically every instance
o f such expenditures they were
made to accomplish something which
Congress had decided to be unwarranted
at the time The reason assigned 
o f course was that such projects 
like thousands of others in as
many communities gave employment
to labor and helped prime the business
pump 
Relief funds are now subject to
closer attention and there is a tendency
toward their reduction The
appropriations for relief and unemployment
are mot being so much diverted
to the demands of special interest  
with projects to be furthered 
Even the organized political machines
o f the larger cities and states are discovering
that relief monies diverted
to political purposes are causing widespread
resentment The public is no
longer charitable toward the projects
which serve certain big cities to obtain
such a large share of the funds
for special purposes only remotely
connected with relief 
Now fashions in spending are running
to war preparations A few
years ago almost anything was allowable
for relief and business pump
priming Now apparently anything
which might become important were
we to entangle ourselves in a European
war needs only the sanction of
military or naval chieftains to pass
Congress   with a whoop  The only
exception thus far has been the
scheme to deepen the harbor of Guam 
4 000 miles from our Pacific
coast line at a cost of 5 000 000 
That was a bit too bold and it failed 
The rest of the measure allowing
 47 000 000 for air plane bases etc 
went through the House with only
four votes in opposition Many of
these bases will be put on islands in
the Pacific ocean thousands of miles
away and some of them so small that
their location is not shown on the average
world map Our country has
had those islands since the close o f
the Spanish American war 41 years
ago In that time we have had many
war scares and actually engaged in a
great war The Japanese war scare
nas been trotted out and exploited as
a dozen congresses took up army and
navy appropriation bills Still not until
a recent survey was made by naval
officials was the worth of these
distant islands for our national defense
discovered Even were war to
occur in Europe this summer it would
be fought to a finish and ended long
before the millions would be spent
upon the war preparations in these
distant places but the money will be
spent just the same 
The War department appropriation
bill will come up next The increase
o f funds for both war and navy departments
will amount to one million
dollars daily the next two years 
There is no doubt of the passage o f
both measures by a large majority 
Then will come another bill providing
one hundred millions more with which
to buy huge quantities of war materials
to be stored away for future
use It too will pass War expenditures
are strictly stylish at present 
The Federal Housing Administration
insured 1 600 millions of home
loans last year The loans were made
by banks insurance companies building
and loan associations etc  the
FHA insuring the mortgages up to 80
or 90 per cent of the loan value It
is claimed that more than 300 000
homes were so financed last year 
The loans are made upon long terms 
payable in monthly installments The
losses on account of such insurance
have been very small It is anticipated
that during 1! 39 the amount of insured
loans will be increased by another
billion The movement is more
general in the larger centers In New
York City and Los Angeles and their
surrounding communities more loans
have been so insured than in all other
larts of the country combined although
loans are being so made and
insured in nearly all the cities There
is provision in the law which permits
the FHA to insure loans on farm properties 
but as yet practically no use
has been made of that provision At
present the loan and insurance companies
are confining their loaning activities
mainly to new building operations
in the larger cities

CO O P E R A T IV E NEW S
Dr Michael Shadid during the past
two weeks in his several radio broadcasts
and public addresses thruout
Wisconsin and Upper Michigan
brought out the fact that some
change in the system of distributing
medical service is inevitable and that
we are facing either of the two alternatives  
state medicine or cooperative
medicine; that the medical profession
as much as they dislike to see
it has decided the cooperative way
is the most desirable 
Dr Shadid pointed out that   Cooperative
medicine serves as a pre
ventive for ills and diseases and acts
as a compromise between state and
competitive medicine It has the ad
vantages of both and the drawbacks
o f neither   He went on to say   If
doctors fail in their duty to make
medicine with all its equipment and
instruments of precision available to
the masses state medicine will and
ought to triumph over competitive
medicine  
(State medicine is a system of free
medical care and practice sponsored
and financed by the state )
  It is easier  said Dr Shadid   to
prevent ill health than to cure disease
and yet competitive medicine is occupied
almost entirely in treating illness 
In the United States two percent
o f the medical dollar is spent for
prevention and 98 per cent for treatment 
 he added   The doctor must
become a health teacher and not a
private tradesman  
Dr Shadid also pointed out that
medicine has become too    vast  to be
covered by one or two medical men
and   to make a proper diagnosis it is
often necessary to obtain the services
o f half a dozen doctors and technicians  
  A sick man  he said   may
have to go to his family doctor to a
stomach specialist a uralogist and
then to an eye ear nose and throat
specialist before a correct diagnosis
o f his disease can be made This is
wasteful of time effort and money 
It brings dissatisfaction to the sick
and discredit to organized medicine  
  I indict the present system o f
medical practice because it is too
costly  Dr Shadid said 
Twenty five per cent of the
American people receive medical care
on a charity basis; 25 per cent pay
exorbitant fees for medical care; and
the remaining 50 per cent too proud
to accept charity and too poor to pay
the high fees get along with little
and at best inadequate medical attention  
The doctors dread state medicine
but if they don t get busy and promote
cooperative medicine they are
going to get state medicine  declared
Dr Shadid 
Dr Michael Shadid is founder and
chief surgeon of the Elk City Okla 
cooperative hospital The hospital
was founded in 1929 and had a capacity
o f 25 beds That number has
now grown to 105 beds The hospital
employs six surgeons and two dentists
and has a membership of about 2500
families Each member purchases a
share of stock for 50 which entitles
the owner to one vote at an annual
meeting with an annual additional
payment of 25 and small service
fees   the member and his family are
provided with medical hospital and
surgical services for a year Profits
may be returned to members by their
vote at annual meetings but so far
they have voted each year to invest
the profits in the hospital and additional
services 
And the services at the Elk City
hospital Dr Shadid said   are the
best in western Oklahoma

ST A T E A ID FOR L IBR ARIES
To develop improve and equalize
library opportunities between town
and country and sections that vary
in ability to support public library
service the Wisconsin Library Association
is proposing State Aid for
public libraries 
A bill has been introduced asking
the 1939 state legislature for an annual
appropriation of 750 000 to
carry out this work 
According to the proposed bill 25
per cent of this appropriation would
form an equalization library fund to
be used as aid in establishing libraries
in areas where none exist and in
building up public libraries to meet
the standards established by the Free
Library Commission 
The remainder of the appropriation
would go into the general library
fund which would be apportioned
on a per capita basis among
the qualifying public libraries of the
state 
The bill is intended to supplement
local support and not to be substituted
for it and does not include special
or school libraries 
In Wisconsin the per capita average
expenditure is  44 while the
minimum income upon which libraries
can maintain adequate service as recommended
by the American Library
Association is 1 Actually Wisconsin s
expenditure for public libraries
is more than 50 per cent below standard 
The 750 000 appropriation asked
o f the state would increase the per
capita expenditure  25 but would
still leave the state average below the
minimum recommended

o f the fact that Charles R 
Lowe Cloud remembers his readers

the hospital in Tomah Last week he
wrote that he and Henry Mike and
Charley Smoke of Wyeville were in
a room together That   nurses are
doing faithful duty and Nancy Plintz 
Irene Miller and Evelyn Murie is taking
care us all night  
Saturday we had a letter from
Charley stating:   Charley Smoke is
died this morning after 5 hi I don t
know how long I will stay here Doctor
says you got to stay here some I
had a flu And Charles Smoke died
flu too  
Today we have a short news letter
from Charley as follows:
There are many Indians had bad
luck and I used to see lots of Indians
back and forth not todays 
I would like to write Indian news 
but somehow I can not write any
more so I have to stop 
There are I feel good every morning

Ernest Rumppe Reporter
A large portion of plaster fell in
the assembly room on Feb 26 The
result was moving all the seats from
the assembly into class rooms and
halls Work started immediately to
put a new steel ceiling in place of
the old one The noise became so
great that classes had to be shortened 
We are now having all the
classes in the forenoon starting at 8
o clock instead of 9: classes are then
run until noon The afternoon is then
used by the carpenters 
The contract in English is again
under way We have no doubt that
it will be completed by the date set 
judging from the junior s and senior s
activity Miss Christianson ordered a
group of humorous essays from the
Madison Library Commission so our
A and B work (75 pages read from
a supplementary text plus a written
summary for an A : 50 pages read 
with a summary for a B) will be secured
from these supplementary tests 
The books are by such representative
humor authors as Stephen Leacock 
Irvin Cobb Christopher Morley 
Will Rogers Robert Benchley and
Don Marquis 
Typing is progressing a little slower
because of the crowded schedule 
as well as the interest in the Whitehall
tournament which also takes up time 
Influenza seems to have caused
many an absentee last week but most
o f them are back this week trying to
catch up on their studies 
As a reporter on the final week o f
the basket ball season I must give
my respects to the Taylor basket ball
team which lived up to the promises
they made that is of being a thorn
in the side of the top ranking team
(Independence) if they weren t on
top themselves 
Taylor Beat Arkantaw
Taylor beat Arkansaw (the substitute
for Mindoro ) in their first tournament
game by a score of 32 to 15 
Duane Lambert did most of Taylor s
scoring He had 13 points Raymond
Owen had nine and Clayton Waller
had six points The score by quarters
shows that Taylor led throughout
the game 9 to 2 at the end of the
first 14 to 10 at half 22 to 12 and
the final was 32 to 15

COM MON SENSE CO N SERVATIO N
By L H Kingston
Bill 17S known as the Public
Hunting and Fishing Grounds bill has
been introduced into the legislature
by Senator Ingram and it would if
enacted bccome one of the most important
pieces of conservation legislation
in recent years 
This proposed law says that the
conservation commission shall acquire
by purchase lease gift or condemnation 
such lands in the state as it
may deem suitable for public hunting
and fishing grounds and further 
the commission shall have the authority
to adopt such rules and regulations
to govern public hunting and
fishing grounds as it deems necessary
to carry out the purposes and policies
o f the law Annual rates will be
set up for first second third and
fourth class hunting lands so that
owners who lease their lands will be
paid according to the acreages and
grades of game cover found on their
property This plan will encourage
landowners to improve game covers
and food patches so as to obtain the
highest possible rating for their lands 
Cutting or mutilation of trees and
shrubs by hunters fire caused by
dropping lighted matches cigarettes
or tobacco failure to close gates or
bars tearing down fences rails wood
or stone piles injury to livestock or
any other act detrimental to property
on leased land shall be considered as
damage which after due investigation
the conservation department shall pay
for Where the commission and claimant
cannot agree upon the amount o f
damages then the county judge shall
make the award Any person causing
damage or violating any of the rules
and regulations governing public
hunting and fishing grounds shall be
subject to the usual punishment by
fine or imprisonment 
In order to finance these proposed
hunting and fishing grounds bill 17S
provides that the fee for resident
hunting licenses shall be raised from
 1 0 0 to 2 0 0 and it specifically
states that this extra dollar shall be
used exclusively for the creation acquisition 
maintenance and administration
o f public hunting and fishing
grounds 
Every year hunters see more and
more   No Trespass  signs going up
on lands where they have been hunting
fo r years and they are frankly
worried for the future of their sport 
On the other hand farmers and landowners
have found it necessary to
protect themselves with such signs because
o f the destructive activities on
the part of a few thoughtless hunters 
The public hunting and fishing
grounds law will ensure hunters of a
place to hunt while at the same time
it protects the farmer and gives him
an income from the game cover on
his land 
Bill 17S is a good one and should
be enacted

De wayne Dutcher of Warrens 
takes exception to some of L H 
Kingston s lines of thought in his
  Common Sense Conservation  articles 
which are published from time

agree on many things 
Mr Dutcher asks us to publish his
letter if we approved or to send it
to Mr Kingston for his consent We
are publishing it without asking Mr 
Kingston s approval feeling quite
sure that he will make no objection
to hearing someone else s opinion on
a subject which means so much to
him W e know Mr Dutcher to be
very much interested in conservation
and are interested in his viewpoints 
There will no doubt be many of our

and I agree with you on many things
but the article that appeared in the
Feb 8 th issue made my blood boil 
First of all I want to say that in
my own opini on sportsmen and deer
hunters will not oppose the bill introduced
by Assemblyman Youngs o f
Oconto You so called conservationmy
own opinion sportsmen and deer
hunters never And another thing 
you say that fire lanes are built into
wild remote and inaccessible regions
for the sole purpose of controlling
forest fires I d like to inform you

Mr Kingston that half the fire lanes
in Jackson county were built on what
was once town highways Many o f
these highways the conservationists
took over with the promise to improve
and leave in the control of the
town board However when they
had graded these roads and made
other changes to suit their own tastes
they put gates across them and the
people were politely informed that
they had no right to travel the roads
that had once been theirs and were
still on the gas tax system And if
you are not satisfied with my own
statement on this matter came down
here some time and I ll point a few
o f them out to you 
Last summer I was working for the
county in and around Pray and City
Point and in order to get to my work
I had to drivel5 and sometimes as
much as 30 miles out of my way to
get there And only because the conservation
people had gates on what
should be public highways I d like to
know if that makes   Common Sense
Conservation  Remote and inaccessible
regions   yes because the conservation
has made them so 
The Wisconsin Conservation Commission
has opened the deer season
to be able to sell more licenses to
hunters then what do they do   They
close all roads leading to the hunting
grounds so that the hunter can t get
to where the game is If that s what
you call being fair and honest I certainly
haven t been living right 
Just what do you mean by the
  meat hunter  type of hunter   If
you mean the violator I can tell you
right now your gates are not stopping
him any more than if they were
not there at all No matter how
many gates you put up you are still
going to have the violators They
have always been here and always
will A violator is not a sportsman 
he never was and he never will be 
All he cares about is to kill a deer
and sell hind quarters to buy whiskey
with at the nearest tavern 
I have the welfare of our wild life
at heart but I don t believe that closing
the highways during an open season
to keep the game hunter who has
paid out good money to buy a license
and deer tag from being able to use
them is going to help one bit If
you want to save the game be fair
about it and close the season for a
year or two but first give the people
a chance to state their case Its
getting so that the people don t have
any choice at all any more when it
comes to Conservation 
Now if you are the   Common sense
conservationist  that you pretend to
be and you are as broad minded as
you should be in your position you
will print this letter along side of
your article next week 
I am sincerely a Conservationist

Whitehall was the scene of a skijumping
tournament today so our
family donned warm clothes and
headed westward to see our first
honest to goodness ski jumping Snow
and a raw wind made the going extremely
disagreeable for the game
lads who put on the show but they
did a grand job despite the bad
weather They skimmed down the
slide and off into space with the
  greatest of ease  miraculously landing
right side up and scooting past us
at a breakneck speed To one who
practically falls down at the mere
thought of skates or skis they seem
like some superhuman race instead o f
just ordinary boys and men We
can understand why they love such a
hazardous sport but darned if we can
figure out how they ever come down
to earth all in one piece!
This week s mail brought a fine
letter from a good friend in Swan
River Minn  Mrs A C Teeter She
sends a recipe and a bit of poetry

The Mother Job
(B y Jane Burr)
It really isn t hard to be a mother 
There really isn t very much to do;
The days are just exac   y like each
other
You simply shut your t   and wander
thru 
For six o clock is time enough for
rising 
And getting all the children washed
and dressed 
And breakfast cooked   it really is
surprising
But mothers never seem to need a
rest 
The lunches must be packed and
jackets rounded 
And everybody soothed and sent to
school;
To say that Mother rushes is unfounded  
She s nothing more to manage as a
rule 
Unless it is to finish piles of sewing
And cook and wash and iron and
scrub and sweep 
To order food and keep the furnace
going
And perhaps then to hide herself
and weep 
And when at last she s tucked them
under covers 
And seen to doors that Dad s forgot
to lock 
Triumphantly at midnight she discovers
Shes  nothing more to do till six
o clock
