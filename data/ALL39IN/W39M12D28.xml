SCHOOL NEWS
Wittenberg Trims Tigerton 38-17
For the first time in a number of
years the local basketeers succeeded
in trouncing the Tigers on their own
floor. Due to the narrow, slippery
floor and poor lighting, the Maroons
could not get adjusted and did not
show much during the first half. In
their anxiety to get going they committed
a number of fouls giving Tigerton
enough free throws to keep the
score even. The count at the intermission
was 14-8 in favor of Wittenberg.
During the third period they
really hit their stride with Luther
Mason leading the attack with 17
points to his credit. Not only did he
score almost at will but made a number
of clever passes that enabled his
teammates to ring up several baskets
apiece. During the last quarter Coach
Christenson used his reserves which
held the enemy in check until the final
whistle. The defensive strength of
the Wittenberg team was indicated by
allowing their opponents only three
field goals. The Tigers were superior
in free throws, gaining 11 of their 17
points by that method. In the preliminary
the Tigerton grades defeated the
Wittenberg grades 27-17.
Rosholt Next Conference Foe
On January 12 Andy Nelson will
bring his team to Wittenberg in an
effort to shove the locals from second
place in the Conference standings. A
thrilling game will be assured by Rosholt’s
recent victory over Iola, the
team which gave Wittenberg its most
decisive defeat of the present season.
Birnamwood still rests in first place
by virtue of its 34-19 victory at Scandinavia
last week.

Alumni Game Friday Night
Friday night a team composed of
stars from Wittenberg teams of other
years will pitch their strength against
this year’s team. Many of the boys
are anxious to play ball on the new
gym floor so a second game will be
played against the Scandinavia City
team, a member of the recently organized
City Team League of Central
Wisconsin.
Game at Bowler January 4
A non-Conference game will he
played against Bowler at Tilleda
Thursday evening, Jan. 4. The Tilleda
hall is somewhat larger than the one
at Bowler and will make the play less
hazardous,
Ruby Jubilee a Great Success With
More Than Three Hundred Present
Tuesday evening’s “ Ruby Jubilee”
at the gymnasium, celebrating the
fortieth anniversary of the graduation
of the first class from the Wittenberg
high school, was one of the finest and
most enjoyable social affairs ever to
be held in this village.
Two hundred and seven graduates,
nearly one half of the total number
that have received diplomas from the
high school down through the forty
years, were present. Those who were
married were accompanied by husband
or wife, which increased the number
of those present considerably. Present
also were the present school board
members and their wives and a number
of former school board members
and wives and a few others.
(In adjoining column will be found
the names of the graduates present at
the Jubilee.)
Following a cafeteria luncheon beginning
at 5:45 and the gathering of
classes in groups to talk over old
times, the program opened, with H arold
Kusserow, class of 1924, in charge.
On the stage with him were two members
of the first class (1899), namely
Alex Brunner, of Chicago, and J. Will
Gates, of this village; two former
teachers of 30 years ago, Mrs. Stella
Braeger Haufe, of Wausau, and Mrs.
Elizabeth Crawford Osborne, of Madison;
and the present principal L. E.
Peterson. The school song was sung.
A welcomc to all was extended by thc
chairman, and letters from P. F. Dolan,
of Shawano, the first principal,
C. H. McDonald, a former school board
member, of Milwaukee, and M. V.
Jones, of Chilton, a former principal,
and telegrams from Alma Berbaum
Wolf, of Highland Park, Illinois, Olga
Berbaum Randlev, of Evanston, 111.,
and Chris. Reed, of Gays Mills, were
read.
The chairman then presented -the
classes, beginning with 1939 and going
down to 1899. Alex Brunner and Will
Gates responded on behalf of the ’99
class with a few well-chosen and
remarks. The two former teachers
present were introduced and responded
with neat little speeches.
The main speaker of the evening
was Jacob Doxtator, who came from
New Jersey, to be here for the Jubilee.
He was introduced by Grover Meisner.
Mr. Doxtator told of his school day's
here and compared them with the
present in the matter of facilities.
He was followed by Principal Peterson
who spoke about recent graduating
classes and said that more than 200
had graduated since he took charge of
the school.
A business session was then held at
which the alumni voted unanimously
to perfect a permanent organization to
be named, “Wittenberg Alumni Association,”
and to meet every two years,
the next time between Christmas and
New Year’s in 1941.
Chairman Kusserow and his committee
members, R. G. Peterson, Allen
Kersten, Ruth Johnson and Carol
Johnson, who did such a good job in
arranging for this event, were selected
to act in a like capacity for the next
meeting. Mr. Kusserow asked the
alumni members to cooperate as much
as possible by notifying the committee
of changes of address and with suggestions
bearing on arrangements for
future reunions. He presented the
committee members to the audience
and thanked them for their good work
in arranging for this Jubilee, telling
about the handicaps they experienced
in the present instance.
An alumni basketball game followed.
The two teams were composed of the
following former stars:

Dancing and singing concluded the
evening, which will always be remembered
by all present as one of the redletter
events of their lives.
A Word Aside
Mr. Kusserow advises us that despite
the committee’s urgent appeal that all
alumni return their reservation card*
by December 23, nearly 100 appeared
without having done so, which naturally
taxed the luncheon committee to
the limit. This, he says, should be
remembered for the future.

Happy New Year to you all!
And now, our friends, have you
made your New Year’s Resolutions—
made in good faith; broken for lack of
will j cwer or something?
Here’s ours: Be it hereby resolved
that hereafter every Christmas Eve
come on Sunday night and Christmas
Day on Monday!
Think of all the doctors, dentists,
storekeepers, butchers, bakers, barbers
and dozens of other public servants
who would welcome such a change in
the calendar. One day off one’s feet;
one day to sleep late; one day to think
of self a little bit, one day in which to
prepare for Christmas! And then a
double holiday with another double
holiday only a week later to usher in
the new year. Could any thing really
be more delightful than such a
change
But to make such a change— ah
there’s the rub. W«> fear that figuring
out a calendar so that Dec. 24th would
always fall on Sunday would tax the
ingenuity of the best mathematicians
of the world. Let us examine the new
calendar which has been suggested.
“Under the present calendar a
“month” may be four weeks, thirty
days, a calendar month, or linear
month and the irregularity of calendar
months causes constant difficulty in
modern business. Calendar reform
has been constantly urged, and a
League of Nations committee has considered
what is known as the 'International
Fixed Calendar.’ According
to this plan, the year would consist of
13 months of 28 days each; the extra
month might be inserted between the
last Saturday of one year and the first
Sunday of the n«*xt. Wtween December
and January or between June and
July, probably the latter, and might
be called Sol. Every 4 years, the extra
day which is now added to February
would be inserted between the end of
one year and the beginning of the
next.
“As all months in the new calendar
would have exactly 4 weeks or 28
days, this equality would be a great
advantage in computing the exact
amount of pay checks, interest, working
days, statistical tables, insurance
and the like. Each month would always
have 4 Sundays never 5. H olidays,
Sundays and birthdays would
always fall on tin1 same day of the
week; the first day of every month
would always be Sunday and the last
day would always be Saturday.
Christmas and the Fourth of July
would always fall on Wednesday.”—
World Book, Vol. II.
No, that new calendar, for all its
practicality otherwise just won’t do!
Be it hereby resolved we stick to the
old. The old way we do. at least, get
a double holiday occasionally for
Christmas and the Fourth of July.

In these 44 words the sage of

once called a “ labor-baiting, pokerplaying,
whisky-drinking, evil old

presidential ring. Then:
**This is the best time of the year. I like

With that, John Nance Garner, at

the White House, went into his house
and changed clothes. A few minutes
later he had gone hunting.
Nobody in Washington was surprised
by the announcement at first,
but over the week-end those 44
words received considerable study.
Points of interest:
1. Unlike other Democratic hopefuls,
Garner did not offer to step
aside if President Roosevelt decided
to run again.
2. He promised to make no effort
to control delegates, indicating he
would be a hard m an to deal with
in the convention hall. Ja ck G arner
presumably refuses to enter into
any trades.
3.- He said nothing about public
questions, which left the impression
that he agrees with the President '
on many New Deal objectives. On
the other hand, this might only be
a mark of politeness.
T H E W A R S :
Plot?
Her disrepute sharply heightened
when the League of Nations expelled
Russia, the German Reich
got some solace when Italian Foreign
Minister Galeazzo Ciano made
an unusual announcement of his nation's
foreign policy. European
diplomacy is now clear as mud, with
Germ any’s ally, Italy, aiding F inland
to fight Russia, who is also
Germ any’s ally.
But Ciano's speech indicated the
picture may soon clear. Only point
of difference between Rome and
Berlin was Germ any’s method of
“ settling” the Danzig-Polish dispute,
in the course of which Herr Hitler
agreed that Italy should rem ain out
of the European war. As for the
R e ic h * friendship with Russia,
Ciano charged Britain and France
forced this solution on Hitler. This,
possibly, is the key to future German-
Italian collaboration.
Italy is still loyal to Berlin in
every way. and still maintains that

Western War
Almost as a repercussion to the
Graf Spee incident I see below > the
western front saw its first direct
artillery duel over the Rhine, This
was purposeless, because the Rhine
was so flooded that troops could not
cross. In another sector hand-tohand
fighting was reported, while
the French sought Nazi spies allegedly
dropped by parachute.
Biggest news developed from Britain's
new aerial patrol, developed to
combat the Nazi mine-laying cam paign.
On three successive nights
royal air force planes raided Germ
a n seaplane bases, after which the
air ministry said it “ tentatively believed’'

N or them War
Still playing to a full house was
the Finnish-Russian war, in which
the Soviet was taking a terrific licking
both in manpower and prestige.
For the first time, U. S. newsmen
like United Press’ Webb Miller and
Chicago Daily News’ Leland Stowe
visited the Karelian front and saw
Finnish troops resting snugly in
their warm trenches while the Russians
stormed away like madmen
across the river, wasting am m unition
and getting nowhere. Soviet
tanks were disabled by the score,
running against snow-covered boulders
or being blasted by anti-tank
guns. In the north the Finns reported
they had encircled two Russian
forces of 10,000 men each.
Spee
Pan America awoke suddenly to
discover its “ neutrality zone’’ (see
map) was ineffectual. Before she
dashed for the safety of Montevideo
harbor in Uruguay, the Nazi pocket
battleship Graf Spee had almost
been blasted to pieces by three British
cruisers. One of them, Exeter,
was so badly damaged she headed
for Britain's Falkland base in the
south* Atlantic, also within the neutrality
zone. (Although Britain w'on
the engagement, Germany lost fewer
men.) Three days later, her 72-
hour Uruguayan permit having expired,
Graf Spee headed for open
sea where British ships waited like
lions for the kill. Suddenly she exploded,
four-inch st£el plates bulging
like paper sacks. Graf Spee
went to the bottom, her skipper
having chosen to scuttle her in the
face of hopeless odds.
Back at Montevideo a storm was
brewing, but Foreign Minister Al-

Secretary of the Treasury Henry
Morgenthau was quoted as testifying
he favored raising the public
debt limit from $45,000,000,000
to $50,000,000,000.
EX PO RTS DOWN—November
U. S. exports were $287,000,000
against $323,168,000 in October,
$12,000,000 of the drop being accounted
for in blockaded shipments
to Germany.
DIES UP—A Gallup poll showed
75 per cent of the U. S. still
favoring continuation of the Dies
un-Americanism investigation,
though presidential criticism has
caused a 4 per cent decline the
past six weeks.

The explosion had repercussions.
berto Guani stuck to his post. The
German minister charged him with
a “ flagrant violation of international
law” for not giving Graf Spee
enough time to repair her damage.
The Nazis even planned to demand
reparations for the ship. Taking no
chances, Uruguay promptly arrested
four of the crewmen and charged
them with blowing up the ship.
A few hours later 1,000 other crewmen,
having launched to nearby
Buenos Aires, were interned by Argentina
for the rest of the war.
As for Germany, the Spee incident
reduced her complement of
capital ships to four. Next day,
Britain reported sinking a 6,000-ton
Nazi cruiser.
I N D I A :
Zetland's Worry
Rapidly approaching, perhaps, is
a crisis in which British domination
of India may pass away. A good
start ot satisfying Indian nationalist
ambitions was made several
years ago when a quasi-home rule
plan was instituted. But in November,
faced with racial differences
between the nll-India congress and
the Moslem league, Viceroy Marquess
of Lithlingow invoked emergency
powers vesting authority in
provincial governments. Native
congress ministries in seven provinces
promptly resigned as part of
Mahatma Gandhi's "passive resistance"
program.
Up in the house of lords to comment
on this situation rose the Marquess
of Zetland, secretary of state
for India. The result of this wholesale
resignation, he said, has been
to "set back the hands of the clock
more than 30 years." Meanwhile
German propagandizes are trying
to make the Indians "look to Nazi
Germany for their freedom.” Only
hope for peaceful settlement, he
thought, was division of legislatures
on communal instead of political I
lines. Thc ambition: "W h at we
have to aim at is that a legislator
will think of himself as an Indian
first and only as a Hindu or Moslem
. . . afterward.”

it was learned the “ certificate plan”

processing tax in new dress (the last
one was thrown out by the Supreme
court in 1936) it would consist of
parity payments paid to the farmer
directly by the processor, who in
turn will pass them on to the consumer
directly. Reason: The U. S.
needs more money next year for
defense, hence must find a source of
income without boosting taxes in a
campaign year.

The Preside.
WASHINGTON.—President Roosevelt’s
slap at Soviet Russia for invading
Finland, plus his proposal to
help the Finns with their own debt
payments to Uncle
Sam, is flabbergasting
the bitterest of
New Deal critics.
Actually Roosevelt
now has the ball,
running towards the
a n t i - Communist
goal line, while the
conservatives and
patriots who have
been winning sentiment
against the
New Deal because
of its pinkish tinge and its implied
hookup with Moscow objectives, deserting
their posts a grim , opposing
tackles, are converted into a cheering
squad, urging the President to
even greater efforts against the Soviets.
It is one of the most extraordinary
reverse plays in the history
of politics, especially as it comes on
the eve of a presidential cam paign
in which the m ain issue will be
whether the New Deal shall be continued
by Roosevelt himself or someone
satisfactory to him . Various
side plays add to this strange situation.
For example, Sen. A rthur H.
Vandenberg of Michigan, who opposed
repeal of the arms embargo
to keep the United States out of foreign
entanglements, is now dem anding
that Roosevelt break relations
with Stalin, recall the United States
ambassador to Moscow, and, by inference
at least, take a step towards
war.
Roosevelt’s delighted comment at
a press conference—that the critics
of the’ United States foreign policies
are Soviet and Nazi leaders plus a
small number of statesmen in the
United States — shows the New
Deal’s satisfaction over developments
which virtually have both
teams playing on “ Quarterback”
Roosevelt’s side.
Reversal of Forr.i Has
Benefited Roosevelt
The nearest comparison in political
history was Woodrow Wilson on
foreign policy. Elected on a “ kept
us out of war” issue in November,
1916, he asked congress to declare
war the following April. But that
case is really not comparable for
the simple reason that the election
intervened between the two happenings.
This reversal of form
which has benefited Roosevelt so
amazingly has occurred before the
selection of a single delegate to the
national conventions which hope to
name his successor.
The men who criticized the President
so bitterly just a few months
ago for wanting to take a step—
embargo repeal—which they insisted
would endanger the neutrality of
the United States are now urging
Roosevelt to go further with his unneutrality
as between Russia and
Finland. They want h im to slap
Russia down. The whole thing puts
quite a few of the high-ranking Republican
leaders in a very silly position
indeed.
To appreciate the full significance
of the development, however, it
must be remembered that there had
been two tremendous build-ups in
this country affecting details of the
whole development. Most important
was the growing conservative resentment
about the alleged “ Reds”
and “ Communists” in the Roosevelt
administration. It was these leftwingers
who were blamed for the
I “ purge” against senators who op-
! posed the President on the Supreme
court issue.
Copper Holds Reciprocal
Trade Agreement With Chile
Only the well-known and highly
successful stubbornness of Secretary
Cordell Hull lies in the way of
quietly dropping overboard the proposed
copper item in the pending
reciprocal trade agreement with
Chile.
Actually there would be a larger
bloc of senators enraged by a reduction
in the duty on copper than
almost any other one product. Most
of the copper producing states are
small in population, but each of
them has two senators, and they
include most of the states from
Michigan, where it is very imporl
tant, west to the Pacific.
To complicate the situation further,
there is already a good deal
of indignation in the mountain states
of the West against the adm inistration
because of the use of Argentine
canned beef for the navy.
In fact so impolitic is the suggestion—
on the eve of a presidential
campaign—to reduce the duty on
copper by 50 per cent that there are
those who say the whole thing was
a smoke screen. The logic of these
observers is that if there were a lot
| of talk about copper, and then the
£
Cordell Hull
red metal were left out, there might
be less opposition to the remainder
. of the agreement than if go much
effort had not been used in fighting
the copper cut.
Feeling on copper on Capitol H ill
ia the stronger because it wa* the
plain understanding of congress,
when the law authorizing the reciprocal
trade agreements was passed,
that the so-called "excise” duties
should not be affected. This is made
clear in the committee reports at
the time, but congressmen are now
very sorry they did not take the
precaution to write the prohibition
directly into the law.
So£alled Excite Tax on
Oil Hai Been Cut in Half
Already one ot the so-called excise
taxes—that on oil—has been
cut in half in a reciprocal treaty
—though there is a little humor
there in that Venezuela, which was
supposed to be the big beneficiary,
promptly increased its export tax
by just that much. The net result
of this, so fa r as imports by the
United States of Venezuelan oil are
concerned, is that the treasury at
Caracas now gets the money which
hitherto went into the treasury at
Washington, while the delivered
price of Venezuelan oil at United
States ports, after payment of duty,
remains the same.
But copper is a horse of another
color entirely. It so happens that
about 40 per cent of the known
copper reserves of the world are in
Chile, and that the biggest mine
there also happens to be the world’s
No. 1 low-cost mine. Whereas many
of the copper mines inside the
American tariff wall happen to be
high-cost producers. Thus the copper
mine owners, and workers as
well, are considerably excited about
what may happen.
It was the tremendous political
strength of this copper bloc in congress
which really put over the logrolling
excise taxes on the top of
the Smoot-Hawley tariff bill.
Technically Cordell H ull is well
within his rights in regarding these
"excise” taxes aa
tariff duties. They
are nothing else, despite
the incorrect
labeling of the im post.
And, as a tariff
duty, it is a
" t r a d e b a r r i e r ”
within the meaning
of Cordell H ull’s
policy of removing
obstructions to international
trade,
a n d w i t h i n th e
meaning of the law which authorized
the reciprocal trade agreements.
Republican Politicians
Are Pretty Desperate
Is it possible for Thomas E. Dewey
to win enough support from elements
now opposing him to land the
Republican nomination for president?
The answer to that is a very
positive "Y e s, but.” For no one can
say at this moment that he will not,
and no one can say that he will.
I f you listen to conversation
among the group most determinedly
against h im —the big campaign
contributors—you m igh t be sure that
he could not possibly bring them
into camp. I f you believe t h a t the
whole story is told. It w ill not be
possible for Dewey to win enough
politicians to his banner—enough o(
the men who will actually control delegates
after the first few ballots at
the Republican convention—unless
he first wins over at least some of
the big campaign contributors who
now are strongly against him.
But conversations with a few of
the wise old politicians who have
visited Washington since Dewey
made his Minneapolis speech convince
this writer that the door is
not closed.
To get the picture clearly you
must realize that the Republican politicians
are pretty desperate. If
they should think, six months from
now, that Dewey was the m an most
likely to wm of all the candidates
before the Republican convention,
the objections they are voicing now
would melt away like a morning
m ist before a strong sun.
Long Since G. O. P. Leadera
Had Presitlent That Suited
It has been a long time since the
Republican politicians had in the
White House a President who really
suited them. Herbert Hoover didn't
even please them on patronage,
much less as a leader. Calvin Coolidge
was highly satisfactory, but it
must be remembered that the Republican
leaders d id n’t really pick
Coolidge. He was forced on them
by a rank and file ground swell at
the Chicago convention after H arding
had been nominated for President
and the leaders, in that famous
smoke-filled room, had chosen
Irvine L. Lenroot for vice president.
W illiam Howard Taft was highly
unsatisfactory. He paved the way
for the Bull Moose split, and eight
years away from the pie counter.
Theodore Roosevelt provoked new
headaches tor the Republican leaders
every few days during his
entire administration.
So W illiam McKinley was the last
President actually chosen by the Republican
leadership who pleased
them after he reached the White
House.
So if Dewey should run like a
bear cat in a few presidential primaries,
knocking off some of the
other leading contenders by handsome
majorities and thus proving
that he was the most likely man
to win the election, the politicians
would be willing to forget all about
his youth and various other objections.

Badger State
Happenings
r
Menasha Tax Rate C ut—The Menasha
council adopted a tax rate of
$32 per $1,000, a decrease of $2 per
$1,000 from the previous year. The
1940 budget was set at $570,752, a
decrease of more than $150,000 from
last year.
No Umbrellas for Cops— Fond du
Lac policemen are under orders to
refrain from carrying umbrellas
while on duty. New regulations also
advise them not to seek free admission
to theatres and free rides on
interurban lines.
Oshkosh Chest Sets Record—The
Oshkosh Community Chest drive this
year was the most successful on record.
Officials said that $37,000 had
been pledged when the drive ended.
The sum exceeded the original and
last year’s by 50 per cent.
Siart “Clean Reading” Drive —
More than 10,000 persons in Fond du
Lac w ill be asked to co-operate in
the Clean Reading council’s drive
to ban “obscene” publications from
city new'sstands. A house to house
canvass w ill be made to promote
the campaign.
Economy Reduces Taxes — Taking
advantage of a surplus resulting
from economical operation during
the last year, the Sturgeon Bay city
council passed a 1940 budget that
w ill give the city a tax rate of an
even $35 per 1,000 valuation, the
lowest on record.
Again R ^ e c t Housing Offer—The
Madison common council voted 15 to
2 to reject the United States housing
authority offer to help finance construction
of a $1,000,000 slum clearance
project in Madison. The council
once before had voted, 16 to 1, to
refuse the USHA offer.
Uniform Speed Lim it Urged—Legislation
to enforce uniform traffic
regulations in Wisconsin’s 71 counties
was advocated at the annual
convention of the Wisconsin’s Sheriff’s
association in Milwaukee. Louis
D. Saicheck. Milwaukee, association
director, said efforts will be made at
the next session of the Wisconsin
legislature to seek enactment of sum
a lawr.
Writ Granted in Phone Case—The
Wisconsin Telephone Co. was granted
a permanent injunction by tw-o
federal judges, restraining the public
service commission from enforcing
temporary rate reduction orders
issued in 1932 and 1933. The order,
signed by Judge Evan A. Evans of
Chicago and Judge Patrick T. Stone
of Madison, released to the company
about $2,500,000 set aside for refunds.
Teachers Get Salary C ut—The Su perior
school board ordered reductions
of 8 to 20 per cent in teachers’
salaries, effecting a total cut of $51,-
100 from the budget. The board, acting
over protests of parent-teachers’
associations and the federation of labor,
stipulated that it had the option
of making additional cuts next
year on 30 days’ written notice should
it feel that further ecpnomy was
necessary.
U tility Price Approved — Circuit
Judge A. C. Hoppmann has approved
an order of the public service commission
fixing $25,000 as the price to
be paid by the village of Pardeeville
for the Pardeeville p lant of the
Wisconsin Electric Light Co. The
village voted to buy the property in
1933 but the case has been involved
in litigation since that time. The
u tility now has 60 days to appeal to
the supreme court.
Photo Decree Rescinded — Photographing
of state employes was left
to the discretion of department heads
following Gov. Heil’s rescinding of
an order to all employes to be photographed
or lose their jobs. The governor
asked the Secretary of State to
withdraw his request for an opinion
from the attorney general on the
legality of the order, and said that
he had decided to make the photographing
voluntary. Zimmerman im mediately
withdrew the request.
Settle Motors Strike—A strike
which has kept 1,100 Waukesha Motor
company employes idle since
Nov. 12 was settled when members
of the (A F L ) International Machinists’
union voted to accept an agreement
drawn up by company and
union representatives. The strike
began after the union sought a contract
providing for a union shop,
changed timing rates, seniority rights
and wage increases. The contents of
the agreement w’ere not revealed.
Must Stand Perjury Trial — W illiam
H. Dinneen. former secretary
of the state public service commission,
must stand trial in Dane county
circuit court on a charge of perjury,
Superior Judge Roy H. Proctor
ruled. His order w’as based on testimony
presented at a preliminpry
hearing six weeks ago. Dinneen was
accused of swearing to false statements
in an action to restrain the

with Ja ne Addams at Hull House,
the pioneer social settlement. They
were devoted and unselfish, but,
when I looked around the H ull House
neighborhood several years ago,
nothing seemed to have changed
much.
Mr. Taylor’s son, Wayne C.
Taylor, grew up in this shadow
of misery, and now moves into
a sort of pantograph enlargement
of the same. He is en
route to F inland, to study and
organize relief there. Tbe social
settlement theory, as bravely
expounded and lived by the
elder M r. Taylor and Jane Addam
s, was that “ all men are
brothers,” and, if fortunate citizens
will live in neighborly intercourse
with the unfortunate,
" a little leaven will leaven the
whole lum p .”
The younger Mr. Taylor, catching
step with his times, was a realist
who believed that the way ahead
lay in understanding of basic economic
forces and in the application
of progressive and enlightened techniques
of government. He became
special adviser to President Roosevelt
on foreign trade; assistant adm
inistrator of the AAA; vice president
of the Export-Import bank of
Washington; assistant secretary of
the treasury. Hc withdrew from
the last-naiued office last February,
dissenting from what he considered
the treasury department’s policy of
shaping money procedure to foreign
policy.
Like the Hull House meliorists,
it would seem that the
economist innovators and renovators
have not yet found the
golden key. A comparison of
notes by father and son as to
what's wrong with West Madison
street, Europe and in-between
points, and what to do
about It, would, I am sure, be Interesting,

Yale in 1916, served in the World

•T U talk English to His Highness,”
said Rundhia. "The old sheep shall
do one useful thing before he dies.
You have the poison ready?'*
“ Yes, but this is a crisis," the
Bengali answered. “ Are you in a
fit condition to control a crisis? To
me, you seem very nefvous. Let
me feel your heart-beat. Why not
postpone this until tomorrow?”
“ Because tomorrow the old sheep
m ight change his will. I ’ve had a
warning from the Resident. By the
day after tomorrow, they might already
have vetoed my succession
to the throne. If he’s already dead
they'll let me succeed, to save themselves
trouble. So poison the old
sheep tonight, and take your money
and go to the devil. I hope I never
see you again. If you fail. I ’ll take
damned good care you hang !”
“ There is no risk of failure, unless
you are too excited and behave
suspiciously.”
“ Yes, there is,” said Rundhia.
“ You do as I tell you. Be a little
late with his tonic, so that he drinks
it greedily. I ’m going in to see him
now. After I come out, you wait
until someone else goes in to see
h im .”
“ But if no one goes?”
“ I will take care that someone
does go. If you give it to him in
someone else’s presence, it will look
more innocent. Will he be able to
speak after he drinks it?”
“ No. It will paralyze his nerves
im mediately.”
“ How long will it take h im to
d ie ? ”
“ Perhaps ten minutes. Perhaps
less. It will appear to be heart
failure.”
“ Very well then. Where’s your
needle? Give me a strong shot.”
“ No. Not too strong. You must
not get the habit. After this, you
will need your faculties and selfcontrol,
if we are not to be found
out. I will give you just sufficient
to steady your nerves.”
The M aharajah stared, noted the
expression on R u nd h ia’s face when
he entered the room and made a
warning gesture toward the Punjabi
stam p salesman.
“ Can he understand English?”
Rundhia demanded.
“ I believe not.”
“ Well, I will speak English. If
he does understand it, it won’t much
matter. I want you to call up the
Resident and demand the im mediate
arrest of Captain Norwood!”
“ Why?” asked the Maharajah.
“ He has not only taken a bribe
from the priests, as you already
know—”
“ I have heard it said.”
“ You know it’s true. And now he
has assaulted me. He knocked me
out with a punch in the face.”
“ Were you d ru nk?” asked the Mah
arajah . And, before Rundhia could
answer: “ It would be beneath my
dignity to ask the Resident to take
official cognizance of a brawl between
two drunkards.”

Lynn changed from the Indian costume.
She entered the Maharanee’s
boudoir in a chiffon evening gown.
“ Please don’t get up, Maharanee
dear. You treat me as if I were
royalty and you a subject or something.”
“ Why did you change your dress,
Lynn? You looked so charming in—”
“ Oh, this dress feels more honest
somehow. I mean more like my
real colors. Maharanee dear, I ’m
afraid I ’m all upset. I ’m not fit to
talk to.”
“ Lynn dear, what has happened?”
“ Rundhia made love to me, and I
wasn’t even polite to him. Captain
Norwood came, and punched Rund
h ia—he knocked him off the wall.
I thought he had killed him. Oh,
why do I keep on getting other people
into trouble!”
The Maharanee’s worried face
seemed to age under Lynn’s eyes:
“ Lynn, did he hurt Rundhia badly
? ”
“ No. I think not. Rundhia walked
aw ay.”
“ Did you speak to Captain Norwood?”
“ Yes, I insulted him. I did it
thoroughly. I suppose I shouldn’t
have, since it was I who injured
him . But I couldn’t help it. He
tore up my letter, so I tore up his.
I am not meek by nature. I ’m not
good at pretending.”
“ And Rundhia wasn’t hurt? You
a ie sure?”
“ Captain Norwood went down off
the wall to look. It wasn't long before
Rundhia walked away. I don’t
know why he didn't come back and
face Captain Norwood, but perhaps
hr was too stunned by being knocked
ofT the wall. Rundhia didn’t behave
very well.”
“ He needs you, Lynn.”
Lynn laughed—bitter—contemptuous:
“ Needs me? I need a friend.
K undhis is—”
“ Be strong,” said the Maharanee.
MI am your friend.”
“ Yes, bless you! Rundhia seemed
Strong,” Lynn said. “ And he talked
like a perfect lover. I had almost
to believe he can love. And
then something happened. There
was shooting—perhaps nothing im portant—
I don’t know. I asked Rundhia,
and I thought he was lying
when he said he d id n’t know. After
that—it was quite sudden—I didn’t
believe in him any longer. I can’t
explain it. Then Captain Norwood
came.”
A servant entered. He announced
that Prince Rundhia was waiting.
“ Lynn, will you see h im ? ”
“ Not alone,” Lynn answered.
The Maharanee thought a minute:
“ It is against precedent, against
custom. Lynn dear, will you be
shocked if I ask Rundhia to come in
here to talk to us?”
Lynn found a smile. “ I suppose
you’re afraid he might brag! Let’s
risk that. I won’t tell.”
Rundhia strode in. He stood stockstill
in the center of the room. He
was wearing a blood-red turban and
dinner jacket. He looked like the
real Rundhia again. Easy to im ag ine
him horsed and riding hard at
an enemy. He gazed at Lynn a moment,
then at the Maharanee:
“ Has Lvnn told you?” he asked.
“ Yes, Rundhia. What did you do
to make Captain Norwood strike
you?”
Rundhia tossed his head. He
looked like a man when he did that.
“ Lynn saw. Lynn heard,” he answered.
“ I went at once and de-

manded Norwood’s arrest. His Highness
your husband, my revered and
beloved uncle, refused. Lynn must
decide.”
“ Decide what?” Lynn asked.
Rundhia looked strangely at her.
"Does he live or die? It was because
you were there that Norwood
struck me. I hadn’t offered to strike
him. There is only one possible retort
to that insult—unless you forbid.
That is what you must decide
now. Lynn, I have offered you my
heart and the throne of Kadur.
What is your answer?”
“ Lynn,” said the Maharanee—and
stopped speaking.
There was a knock at the door. A
servant entered:
“ Captain Norwood sahib! He
waits. He begs leave to speak to
Her Highness the Maharanee. Captain
Norwood says his business is
very urgent.”
“ I will not see Captain Norwood,”
said the Maharanee. “This is no
hour for me to receive h im .” She
stared at Rundhia. Then, slowly, to
the servant: “ TeU Captain Norwood
he should ask for His Highness my
husband. 1 will send word to His
Highness, asking h im to receive
Captain Norwood.”
The servant vanished.
Lynn got up out of her chair. She
looked desperate but perfectly calm.
“ Lynn darling,” said the Maharanee.
Rundhia interrupted: “ Norwood’s
fate is in your hands. I will do anything
for you—if—”
“ If what, Rundhia?”
“ If you accept my love.”
“ I don’t love you,” she answered.
“ Accept my love. My love will
make you love m e !”
“ If not?” Lynn asked.
“ I will kill Norwood. After that,
I will let happen what may. If my
love means nothing, I will trample
it into oblivion. Yes or no, Lynn?”
“ R undhia.” Lynn’s voice was as
quiet and controlled as if she were
facing death. “ The barrier between
you and me is your laugh when you
boasted of Captain Norwood’s ruin,
i You promised me that you would
do your best to clear him. Did you?”
“ No,” said Rundhia. “ But if you
will m arry me, I will. I will accept
your promise. I don’t believe you
know how to break one. I will keep
m ine.”
“ Rundhia,” said Lynn, “ I will
promise to marry you, if you will
write, and sign, a retraction of any
and all accusations against Captain
Norwood. You must put it in the
form of a letter to the British Resident,
and it must be witnessed by
i the Maharanee and the Maharajah.
You must meet Captain Norwood in
my presence, and the Maharanee’s,
and you must say to him personally
that you withdraw. 1 won’t
ask you to beg his pardon, because
I won’t do that. I won’t speak to
him . But I insist on your behaving
like a m an .”
The Maharanee spoke suddenly
with a ring of command in her
voice:
“ Rundhia, go to the table and
w rite!”
Rundhia went to the table. Lynn
sat down beside the Maharanee:
“ Maharanee dear, you must be
my wise friend, for 1 am ail in the
dark. I feel so western and so lonely,
and I don’t know whether I am
doing right or wrong. But I will
do my best.”
“ Lynn—”
Lynn interrupted her: “ Will you
make me a promise? Will you never,
never tell Captain Norwood why
I married Rundhia? Will you keep
it a secret?”
The Maharanee was silent for
nearly a minute. She was not quite
dry-eyed. She spoke suddenly, lowvoiced
:
“ Lynn, do you love Captain Norwood?”
“ Maharanee dear, I have promised
to m arry Rundhia.”
CH A PT E R X X I
Norwood stood stock-still, beneath
a Tibetan devil-mask, between two
suits of ancient Indian armor. He
had sent up his card to the Maharanee
with a request for an im m e diate
interview. It was an outrageous
request, anckhe knew it. The
palace chamberlain approached
him , stared—stared harder—hesitated,
and then:
“Captain Norwood? We had heard
you are d e ad !”
“ Yes. I have been wondering who
is sorry I ’m not dead. Has the M aharajah
heard it? ”
“ No, I believe not. He is rather
inaccessible this evening. And it
was only a rutnor, unconfirmed yet.
It was thought best not to mention
it to him prematurely. May I congratulate
you on your escape. It
was said that criminals attacked
your camp. I am sincerely—”
“ Thanks.”
“ Your business at the palace? I
think the M aharajah might be
pleased to see you. He has a document—”
“ I have asked to see the M aharanee.”
“ Oh, impossible! Captain Norwood,
please. We have been very
unconventional of late, but—”
“ Here comes the servant,” said
Norwood.
The servant delivered his message:
the chamberlain accompanied
Norwood upstairs as far as the anteroom
that led into the M a ha raja h ’s
study:
“ I am sure His Highness will be
glad to see you, because of that new
document he has discovered. The attendant
in the anteroom will announce
you. Hee-hee! You may believe
it or not, but I wouldn’t dare
to do it.
“ Don’t mention m y nam e,” said
Norwood.
“ I wouldn’t think of it. The doctor
and I are not cronies. I will
simply say someone went in. I believe
you will be admitted. His
Highness spoke of you. I think he
really wants to see you.”
The chamberlain left him. Norwood
was announced. The Punjabi
stamp salesman was dismissed,
smiling as if he had done good business.
The door closed, and Norwood
was alone with the M aharajah.
At last the M aharajah spoke: “ I
am pleased to receive you. Captain
Norwood, even though the hour is
unusual. You came to speak to me
about the—ah—boundary dispute? I
have news. Since I saw you, my
secretary has found a document
which seems to me to make tha
priests’ case so ridiculous that—”
“ Oh, I expect to find in the favor
of the priests, Your Highness. Those
documents may interest lawyers. I
am only concerned with the boundary
line. I have been accused of
accepting a bribe from the
priests— ”
“ Oh! Captain Norwood, you astonish
me. Who is your accuser?”
“ I supposed you already knew. He
will tell you. As a matter of fact, I ,
called on Her Highness the Maharanee.
I want to speak to Miss Lynn ;
Harding. I have reason to believe
that without the Maharanee’s advice
she might refuse to see me until j
perhaps tomorrow. I need to see j
her tonight. I hoped to persuade
the Maharanee to arrange the inter- j
view, but she refused, so I came to
you instead.”
“ Is it urgent? Won't you please be
seated? Won’t you read this docum
ent?”
“ Your Highness, do you think I
would disturb you at this time of
night if it wasn’t urgent!”
“ Oh, well, possibly an interview
can be arranged. I will enquire
presently. Won’t you read that docum
ent?”
Norwood smiled agreeab’y: “ I
will. As you have reason to know,
sir. I ’m a bit slow at reading this
ancient script.”
“ I wouldn’t care to let that out of
my possession,” said the Maharajah.
“ Suits m e,” Norwood answered.
“ I ask nothing better than to sit
here for the time being. You will
learn why. later.”
The M aharajah looked up sharply,
but Norwood raised the document
between them. He couldn’t see Norwood’s
face:
“ You flatter me,” he said after a
moment.
At last came a knock at the door.
The M aharajah tapped the gong
with his fingers and the Bengali doctor
entered, making his suavest professional
bow. He was followed by
the M a ha raja h ’s personal attendant,
carrying a big blue goblet on a silver
tray. The Bengali eyed Norwood
with horror.
“ You are late,” said the Maharajah.
“ Why are you late?”
“ I was delayed, your H'ghness.
I - ”
Norwood had laid down the document.
He rose from his chair. He
stepped behind the Bengali. He held
his right fist ready for emergency
and seized the goblet in his left hand.
Tho Bengali stepped back, out of
reach of the fist. The Maharajah
made a sudden exclamation, not unlike
a sheep’s bleat. The white-clad
servant backed away, showing the
whites of his eyes. Norwood held
the goblet toward the Bengali:
“ Drink i t ! ” he commanded.
The Bengali was speechless. It
was several seconds before he could
stammer: “ Sir, are you m a d ? ”
The M aharajah, with his elbows
on the desk, and one hand within
reach of the drumstick of the golden
gong, leaned forward, staring.
Norwood spoke again quite calmly.
But it was a deadly calm. It
frightened the Bengali:
“ You are, aren’t you, the doctor
who poisoned Mrs. Harding’s
toast?”
“ Sir. beware whom you slander!”
The Bengali appealed to the Maharajah:
“ Is Your Highness pleased
to hear me slandered by a madman
who is known to have been
bribed by—”
Norwood interrupted: “ Cut thatl
You heard me. Drink i t ! ”
“ That is His Highness’ tonic.”
“ Drink i t ! ” said the Maharajah.
He looked almost happy. He sounded
quite ca!m. But his fingernails
drummed on the desk. Not a sign
of humor.

Supplying pure, good-tasting water
to a modern city has its ups and
downs. One of the biggest “ downs”
is the sudden appearance of a smell
oi taste suggesting moldy basem
tnts, cucumbers, pig pens or longdead
fishes. This means that algae
is in the reservoir and instead of
cal'ing the police with a drag-net,
the trouble shooters at the water
works go hunting with a microscope.
Algae are the simplest and most
ancient forms of plant life. They
do not bother d r in k in g water as long
as they behave themselves. Usually
they are taken care of by filtration
and other purification. But. like any
crowd, there is always a smart aleck
or two. That is when the superintendent
of the reservoir has his worries.
Nearly every city water system
that draws its supply from surface
reservoirs must be guarded constantly
against sudden invasions of
such algae and their relatives,
writes Walter E. Burton in Nature
Magazine. The chemist at the water
works keeps a rogue’s gallery
of photomicrographs of the offenders.
Once they are identified bo
starts in to round them up—and out.
One of the most offensive algae—
Reservoir Enemy No. 1—is Synura
Uvella. He is a two-tailed creature
that likes to travel in gangs of 50
or so. Such a bunch, magnified 600
times, makes a spot about the size
of a quarter. Three of these gangs
in a gallon of water will make it
taste pretty awful—some say like
geraniums; others like dead fish.
Synura loves the cold, so is specially
offensive vn winter.
A nabaenj is good-looking algae—
under the microscope—with cells arranged
in graceful curlicues. However,
it creates an odor and taste
described as “ grassy, moldy and
vile.” Asterionella adds the delightful
touch of a pig-pen odor to the
reservoir water, and it, too, is pretty,
with its cells arranged like a
star.
These and other public water enemies
are one reason why you have a
water bill to pay. Ju s t as you need
a police department to protect you,
so you need the men at the water
works, particularly the trained
chemists, to keep the water pure
and tasty.

Ambition
The teacher was asking the chil- t
dren what they were going to be I
when they grew up. Some were go- !
ing to be stenographers, nurses and
doctors.
When she came to Patty, she said:
"W h at are you going to be, P a tty ?"
“ A rich widow," Patty answered.
Made a Difference
“ Dad, what is inertia?”
“ Well, if I have it, it’s pure laziness;
but if your mother has it, it’s
nervous prostration."

When 1940 reaches New York City in a blare of noise at 12:01 a. m. Monday, it will already be early Monday
‘ning just east of Australia in the Chatham islands. Meanwhile, at Honolulu the clock will evening , register 6:30 p. m . I
Sunday. The new year is born on the lonely Chatham islands, 414 miles southeast of New Zealand and races west*
ward at 1.000 miles an hour. About 200 shepherds and fishermen in the Chatham group celebrate the New Year
by ringing the church bell on Hanson island. The international date line, near these isles, was set by the British
admiralty and runs near the 180th meridian of longitude.

Twenty-nine days hath February
in 1940, which gives the maidens
free rein to blurt out those m arriage
proposals they've been saving since
1936.
Leap year is so-called because it
"leaps forward” a day as compared
with an ordinary year. It so happens
that the leap years coincide j
with years divisible by four without

Y e ar’s eve? It ’s being done more
than ever before this year as America
turns to stay-at-home entertain- j
ment.
If so, you’ll want an informal affair
with a buffet style supper late
in the evening, patterned after the
Swedish “ smorgasbord.” The table
is generally placed in the center of
the room and covered with any kind
of linen suitable for the occasion.
Plates are placed in a pile at one
side of the food to be served—you’ll 1
find guests enjoy serving themselves!
Your menu can be very plain or
very fancy, as you prefer. Here
are a few samples from which you

Plan a “ clock party” to entertain
your guests New Year’s eve. For
this you’ll need all the alarm and
■’striking” clocks you can find. Set
them at different hours and put
them in all sorts of unusual places
so that chimes and gongs will sound
from everywhere in the most unexpected
way — under davenport
cushions, in the dining room buffet
and behind the radio.
Use black-and-white decorations,
with clock faces drawn on white
cardboard peering from everywhere,
black-and-white paper drapes, a
black-and-white checkered paper
cloth for your table, and blackand-
white glass or china.
You can have a clever questionand-
answer clock game, too. Have
your questions typed on slips of paper
with space for answers. Pass
them around, set a time lim it for
answering, and make your prizes
something to do with time—a calendar,
diary, kitchen clock or egg-timer
Here are some typical questions:
1. What book of the Bible is on a
clock? Answer—Numbers.
2. What part of a clock means
most to an Oriental? Answer—Face.
3. What has a bed in common
with a clock ? Answer—Springs.
4 What part of a clock would moat
interest a law yer' Answer—Case.
5 What do you have that a clock
has? Answer—Hand*.

By G E O R G E T. E A G E R
W HEN Presidents of the
United States find it valuable
to take the trouble to remember
details about the thousands
of people they meet, it
would seem well worth while
for business men, salesmen and
retail sales clerks to cultivate
this simple way of m aking
friends.
John Hays H am m ond told
me of a reception given in
Wyoming to Theodore Roosevelt in
1912. A long line of people were
waiting to shake hands and Roosevelt
had taken pains to learn some
simple fact about each of his local
admirers. He was informed that
one man had visited the White
House and had six children, one recently
born. His greeting was:
‘‘How are those
five-oh no, I believe
you have six
children now?”
The m an was politically
im portant
and from
that day became
an ardent Roosevelt
booster.
It is said that
President G a rfield
built a reputation
for a remarkable memory by
a very simple device. When shaking
hands with any m an or woman,
over fifty, he usually asked. ‘‘How
is the old trouble?” W'hen this was
said in just the right confidential
tone the voter invariably gave details
about some past illness and
praised the President’s memory and
thoughtfulness forever after.
A former bellboy became m anager
of an important hotel chiefly because
he trained himself to rem em ber
names and faces of thousands j
of guests. Retail sales people can- |
not be expected to remember all
customers. But in training themselves
to remember even a reasonable
percentage of their customers,
they will be using a powerful
force for turning casual purchasers
into regular customers.
ADVENTURE IS
NEEDED, TOO
O NE of the officers of an im portant
New York bank
has no definite banking duties
but is always busy. A friend
once asked h im to define his position.
“ As you are a golfer, I
will tell you,” said the banker;
“ I am the niblick of this organization.
When fine old concerns
that have borrowed money from
us get in a hole it is my business
to get them out.”
His friend asked h im to discuss
the things that cause a business to
get into difficulties. “ Business is a
combination of adventure and caution,”
he replied. ‘‘Sales and progress
are the products of the adventurous
mind. But a business stays
solvent when expenses are kept
within bounds by the cautious, accounting
type of
mind. The right
combination of
the two minds
makes a healthy
business.
“ B u t it h a s
been my observation
that when
the expense, accounting
type of
m ind dominates
a business things
are headed for trouble. When something
happens that is not caused by
men, lawyers term it an ‘Act of
God.’ The accounting mind is too
liable to look upon sales as an ‘Act
of God,’ which men can do little
about. As a m atter of fact sales
are man-made, created by the adventurous
mind that believes in new
products, advertising and exploration
of the unknown.”

LONDON.—E arly in 1921, a few
weeks before the centenary of N apoleon’s
death, Wickham Steed, famous
journalist and former editor of
the London Times, asked Marshal
Foch (who knew more about Napoleon
than any of the other Allied
generals) whether he thought Napoleon
would have done better than
he had as commander in chief of the
Allied and Associated armies in the
closing period of the war, or whether
modern conditions would have
made Napoleon look small.
“ Foch answered,” says Mr. Steed
(in his book, ‘‘The Press” ) “ that he
had often put this very question to
himself when he passed before Napoleon’
§ tomb at the Invalides d uring
the war, and had come to the
conclusion that Napoleon's infinite
capacity for taking pains would have
enabled him to master modern war
conditions in about six weeks. Then,
said Foch, 'he would have invented
some new tricks, found some new
dodge, and would have knocked the
astonished enemy head over
heels.’ "
Vegetables are not apt to be prime
favorites with m e n; practically every
m an has a
little black list of
his own—vegetables
he just will
not accept graciously.
Father is
apt to be as chary
of spinach and
other vegetables
as his own eight-year-old, and to
look upon salads as mere woman’s
nonsense! It isn’t strange, if Ju n ior,
who adores his Dad, begins to
proclaim his likes and dislikes in
no uncertain terms. Like father,
like son! So coax father to keep his,
*‘I-don’t-likes” to himself—at meal
time.
But there are salads and vegetables
that father really enjoys. You’ll
find suggestions in my booklet,
“ Feeding F ath e r,” for preparing
them, and recipes, too, for his favorite
meat dishes and desserts.
B ut to get back to vegetables,
have you ever wondered why the
very people who love to nibble on a
raw carrot, fresh from the garden,
are the ones who need to be coaxed
to eat them once they’re cooked?
Y o u ’ll find one solution to the problem
of getting Dad and Ju nior to
eat their carrots, right there. Why
not serve them crisp, raw carrot
sticks for a vegetable? Or make a
crisp, colorful salad by combining
shredded raw carrots and shredded
raw beets with the tender young
leaves of raw spinach? Mix lightly
with sour cream salad dressing or
french dressing, and serve from a
salad bowl so that the boys may
help themselves.
Perhaps just changing the methods
of preparing and serving them is
all you need to do to arouse family
interest in vegetables. Here are
some recipes that are just a bit outof-
the-ordinary—recipes I think your
fam ily will enjoy.

“ Forest Death Trap”
YOU know, when you go hunting, you more or less expect to
meet up with adventures of a certain sort. You might reasonably
expect to be treed by a bear, or hopped on by a wildcat, or
m aybe bogged down in a mess of quicksand or socked on the coco
by a failing tree. You m ight expect almost anything BUT the sort
of mystifying experience that fell to the lot of George S. Q uartin
of Brooklyn, N. Y ., on a hunting trip near Kingston, N. Y ., in th*
m iddle of Jan u a ry , 1929. The best adventures are like that. It
isn’t what you expect, but what you D O N’T expect, that gives you
the big th rill you remember a ll down through the years.
George Q uartin and his friend Martin Ross went hunting. They
m ig h t have expected to run across bears, wildcats, quicksand or
fa llin g trees, but here’s what actually did happen.
They started out from the little village of Accord, N. Y .—
started out into the woods, and along about evening, after
trying for two or three hours to find their way back, decided
th at they must be lost. That’s something else a hunter might
easily expcct, and certainly it did happen. But they don’t count that as
an adventure. It was only the beginning of a train of circumstances
that led to a strange, terrifying night when everything was against them
and nothing seemed to make sense.
Night had come on, and still they were walking in circles trying to
find their way out of the woods. They were looking for a place to sleep
when M artin Ross saw a light in the distance.
Hunters Discover Weatherbeaten House.
I t seemed to be a flare of some sort. The two men started
walking toward it. Tlie flare died out before they had gone two
steps, but moving in its direction, they came to an old, weatherbeaten
frame house standing in the middle of a clearing.
There was no light in the house, but they approached and knocked
on the door. There was no answer, but George tried the latch and
the door opened. They went inside—into a big, empty room. There
was a fireplace in the corner, and some wood beside it. They started
to build a fire, but they never got it lighted. F rom that m oment on,
Terrified now, the two lads picked up their rifles and began shooting
a t the door.
events crowded on the heels of events so rapidly that they had no time
to think of anything else.
F irst came a crash outside. It sounded near the door. George and
M artin ran to it—and found it locked. Someone had fastened it from
the outside!
Then it was they noticed that the big, dim room had no windows.
What kind of a house was that? They noticed, too, that
the door was a heavy one, made of solid oak-tw o or three times
as thick and strong as any mere dwelling door had any business
to be. There was something mighty strange about that windowless
dwelling. A disquieting fear crept into the hearts of both
of them. What sort of place had they stumbled into?
P eculiar Odor Permeates the Building.
Shouting brought them no answer. Then they began to hear voices
outside. Whoever it was out there was ignoring their cries. They heard
sounds of a heavy object being drawn somewhere. A peculiar odor,
faint at first, began to permeate the whole building. The two lads lay
down in a corner, but not to sleep. They lay huddled together, trapped
like rats, wondering what their mysterious captors would finally do
with them.
They lay there silent while the hours went by. Then, suddenly
they were aroused by the sound of an explosion and the
thud-thud of running feet. The smell of smoke began to fill the
room—and in another few minutes the room was thick with the
smoke itself.
Black, acrid, choking smoke! It billowed up from somewhere below
them—filled their lungs and set them to coughing. Terrified now,
the two lads picked up their rifles and began shooting at the door. But
the door was too thick to yield even to rifle bullets, and if the men outside
heard the shots they gave no sign of it.
The room was getting hot. Now they could hear flames crackling
beneath them. The smoke was so thick that they could hardly breathe.
They were running around in panic, aimlessly dashing from one side of
that strange room to another. F lam e was creeping through the cracks
in the floorboards—licking the sides of the wall with its m yriad red
tongues. Time was passing, but they weren’t conscious of it. All they
knew was the terrible fear of being burned alive in the mysterious trap
they had fallen into.
Seek a Place to Escape Intense Heat.
Then they were beginning to drop from exhaustion and lack
of a ir. First George, then Martin. They were on their knees,
groping for a spot where the intense heat would not sear their
skin when they heard a ham m ering on the door.
They were too weak then to care much what was happening.
Through a daze they watched the door splinter and fall to pieces.
They saw it broken down, felt a merciful breath of fresh air roll
in through the smoke—saw d im , foggy figures come dashing in
through the doorway. Then hands were lifting them—dragging
them out into the gray dawn of a January morning, and George
saw that he was in the arms of a state trooper and being Nfted
into the front seat of a squad car.
In another m om ent, Martin was in the car with him , and they were
rolling along a backwoods road toward Kingston—still wondering at
the meaning of the terrifying ordeal they had been put through. The
whole answer d idn’t come until other troopers brought in two men they
had captured in thc neighborhood of the house of mystery. The truth
was that M artin and George had stumbled on a backwoods moonshine
plant. The moonshiners, taking them for revenue agents, had locked
them in, and left them to die when, a few hours later, their still exploded
and set the house afire. But someone who saw the blaze phoned
the troopers. Otherwise two lads who had gone a hunting m ight have
ended their day of sport in a night of tragedy.

Steel or iron have been favored
for sports equipment since ancient
times, when Greek athletes hurled
the javelin in their games, and then
down through the Middle ages, when
armored knights tested their skill in
tournaments. Today steel is more
p rominent than ever in sports and
games, and every year millions of
pounds of steel are bought in the
form of sports and recreation equipment.
When many modern sports
were develbped wood and leather
were used widely, but the trend is
now toward steel where speed,
strength and safety are important.
Golf, a game in which little steel
was once used, in 1938 absorbed
about 1,069,000 pounds in the m anufacture
of new clubs, exclusive of
other uses on the courses.
Of the total for golf clubs 175,000
pounds of steel were used for the
shafts of wood-headed clubs, while
894.000 pounds were used for the
shafts and heads of irons. On the
courses indeterminate amounts of
steel were used for pins to mark the
steel cups and for watering equipment.

Frank Crowell received a broken
pelvis, several fractures in an arm
and a number of bruises and cuts
Saturday evening when a cart he was
pushing along the highway was hit
by a passing motorist. He was given
first aid by a local doctor and then
taken to Shawano Municipal Hospital,
where he is reported to be recovering.
Indications are that he was not hit
by the car directly but received his
injuries by being hit by the cart and
its contents in the collision. The cart
was loaded with heavy concrete
Christmas stances. He had been selling
a number of these down town and was
returning home with the unsold lot.
The accident happened near his home
on Highway 29.

were well executed with feeling A
