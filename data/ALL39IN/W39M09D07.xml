         <p>Senate Votes Diversion
Wisconsin's upper legislative house,
the senate, has finally endorsed a tax
bill, one calling fo r a diversion o f 7Vfc
million dollars o f highway money to
help pay general state expenses.
By a vote o f 18-11 the new tax bill,
a substitute to the measure enacted by
the assembly nearly two months ago,
was sent back to the assembly. The
diversion amendment, offered by Senato
r Jess Peters of H artford, carries
w ith it a reenactment o f the 60 per
cent surtax per package tax on cigarettes.
The latter is expected to raise
6 million dollars and the surtax 4%
m illion dollars. The 18 million dollars
revenue provided fo r in this measure
is still short some 9 millions o f balancing
the budget, because the substitute
also provides that the state shall pay
20 per cent o f all relief costs which increases
the already “ top” budget by
about 3 million dollars. The new pension
bill with a $40 per month maximum
m ight well add another 2 million
dollars.
The 18-11 vote on passage by the
senate does not indicate the opposition
to highway diversion. The initial vote
on adoption was 17-15. A tie vote was
eliminated when Senator W hite changed
his vote. (In the case o f a tie in
the senate the L ’eut. Governor votes.)
Senator W hite and others voted
to send the diversion bill to the assembly,
even though they are in principle
opposed to that policy, with the
hope that if the assembly should not
agree then the tax bill w ill go to a
join t committee on conference
differences will be ironed out. The
assembly has already rejected a diversion
amendment 92-1.
N ew Tax Bill
A revenue bill which would raise
sufficient funds to balance the budget
was introduced into the assembly late
last week by Assemblyman Frank
Graass o f Sturgeon Bay.
Graass estimates that his bill would
raise slightly more than 33 million
dollars, enough to balance the budget,
provide for 15 per cent return to local
units for relief costs, pay a maximum
monthly $40 old age pension, and appropriate
$600,000 for a Bangs disease
elimination program.
Revenues under the bill would be
raised in the follow ing manner:
Income tax adjustments $15,350,000
C igarette Tax ............... 6,000,000
Estates Tax ................... 6,490,250
Chain Store T a x ........... 600,000
H ighw ay Readjustment 4,755,866
Capitol Notea
The state Works Progress Adminis
tration has completed its reduction o f
pay rolls to 44,350 in compliance with
the quota set by federal authorities.
This is a reduction from 51,940 project
workers on July 31.
Both legislative houses have passed
a bill which would extend the state
home and farm credit administration
fo r two years with an appropriation
o f $99,000. The agency, created in
1933 to assist needy farm ers and
homeowners in adjusting their debts,
went out of existence July 1, a fter
Governor Heil made no provision for
it in his budget.
B y a vote o f 19 to 11 the senate confirmed
the Governor’s appointment of
W a lly Adams, Conover, to the state
conservation commission, a fter action
on the appointment had been twice
postponed.
I t cost almost 10 million dollars
more to operate and maintain Wisconsin’s
state government in 1937 than
it did in 1932, the United States Department
o f Commerce reports. Total
cost o f state functions in 1937 was
$61,364,000, the body says.
A fte r Governor Heil vetoed a bill
which would have required the state
highway commission to maintain village
and city streets which are a part
of the state trunk highway system,
Mayor James R. Law o f Madison,
president o f the League o f Wisconsin
Municipalities, sent letters to state
mayors o f cities over 25,000 population
asking their aid in having the legislature
over-ride the veto.

The bill would reduce income tax exemptions
fo r single persons from $8 to
$6 and fo r married persons from
$17.50 to $15.00. The 60 per cent surtax
would be reenacted with exemptions
reduced to the same scale as
above in the normal tax. The bill also
proposes to expire the present 3 per
cent tax on corporation dividends and
replaces it with a general 2 per cent
surtax on net incomes o f corporations.

Miss Elsbeth Britzke and Philip

with palms, gladioli, and mixed bouquets
o f flowers. Green ferns enbanked
the altar. The Rev. George Fierke

was played by Harold Kusserow,
church organist.
In the bridal party were Miss Helen

o f honor; Miss Marjorie Kohn and
Miss Dorothy Kriegt 1. nieces o f the
groom, as bridesmaids; Donna Dobbe,
as flow’er g irl; Ferdinand Kartte, a
brother o f the bride, as bestman; and
the ushers were Arthur Britzke. a
brother o f the bride, and Herbert K riegel,
a nephew o f the groom.
The bride, a daughter o f Mr. and
Mrs. August Britzke, o f the town o f
Germania, chose a white satin dress
fashioned with lace shoulders and long
sleeves. She wore a floor length veil
and her flowers were pink roses and
white pompons tied with ribbons.
A pink marquisette dress with a

Kenneth Brunner and W illard
Wendlandt and Ray Newell, of M ilwaukee,
made a visit during the holidays
in the Leo Brunner home while
on a bicycle tour that took them as fa r
north as the lake country. By the
time they got back to Milwaukee they
had gone more than 500 miles. The
young men had no brakes on their
bikes. They stopped the wheels by
catching hold o f the front tire with
gloved hands; they had no coaster
brakes and used toe clips on the
pedals, which enabled them to pull up
as well as down on the pedals. In that
w ay they could pick up speed faster.
They had one or two mishaps, with
minor injuries resulting; only once did
they find it necessary to detour. They
enjoyed the trip very much.
Family Owns Farm fo r Century
A very Vose and fam ily on Sunday
met wTith members of the Vose fam ily
at the old Vose homestead two miles
west of Gurney, Illinois, fo r a party
in honor of Mrs. J. F. McCormick, of
Los Angeles, and to celebrate, at the
same time, a century o f Vose ownership
o f the farm.
Mr. Vose’s great-grandfather. Capt.
Nathaniel Vose, a native o f Massachusetts,
settled on the farm in August,
1839, and later built and operated two
sawmills. For a hundred years now.
the Vose farm has been the home of
Vose children, grandchildren and
great-grandchildren. Back in the old
days, a half-mile track was rolled in
the level acres, and this was a training
ground for highly bred harness
horses. Later on. dairying became the
fa rm ’s central activity.
Sells Stock and Fixtures
L. A. Swanke today disposed of his
stock and fixtures at the filling station
on Grand avenue owned by Mrs. Strom

War Threats S till Hold Stage
But Hope Is Not Abandoned;
Nazis Get Chance to Bargain

are those of the news analyst and not necessarily of this newspaper.)
R e lea se d by W estern N e w s p a p e r Union.

W ar or long negotiations, either
m ay be the outcome of the diplom
atic exchanges now proceeding between
London and Berlin. Much depends
upon the nature of H itler’s reply
to the latest m essage from the
British cabinet. Tension is high in
all European capitals, w ar threats
still hold the stage and before these
lines reach the reader, the clash of
arm s m ay be resounding in Europe.
But hope for a peaceful settlement
o v er Poland has not been abandoned.
The British and French, apparently,
are w illing to concede something
to Germ any, but by no means all
that H itler demands. The showdown
m a y com e quickly.
It is apparent that each side is
tryin g to bully the other with its
bellicose intentions in order to force
som e sort of a deal to avert war.
Th e latest British note, it was said,
shows a willingness to facilitate a
negotiated settlem ent between G erm
an y and Poland. It also contained
a flat w arning that any Germ an
threat to the independence of Poland
would find Britain and France
fighting on the side o f the Poles.
It is evident that at last the patience
of France and Britain has
IG N A C E M O SCIC KI
P o la n d '% p ilo t .
Teached the lim it of endurance over
H itle r's continual grabbing of territory.
The brutality, bad faith and
m enacing methods of the N azi g o vernm
ent have kept Europe in a state
o f upheaval fo r years, and this must
Stop now, and definite guarantees
must be given that w ill ensure the
p eace of Europe.
Diplom antic negotiations have
been proceeding in half a dozen European
capitals in an effort to a vert
another world holocaust. Principal
interest centered in London where
the British cabinet wrangled for
hours over H itler’s latest proposals
lo r a peaceful settlem ent of the Germ
an-Polish territorial dispute. These
proposals w ere submitted to Sir
N e v ile Henderson, the British am bassador
to Berlin, in an interview
requested by H itler. Henderson flew
to London and laid them before the
B ritish governm ent. Th e ambassador
was to fly hack to Berlin with
the British cabinet’ s reply.
While the fuehrer’s proposals w ere
not at that tim e made public, it
■was the belief in well-inform ed quarters
that they w ere not likely in
their present form to offer any hope
o f providing a solution. Some
sources close to the government
w e re downright pessimistic.
C ham berlain’ s governm ent, arm ed
w ith dictatorial powers voted by
parliam ent, continued to oil up the
B ritish w ar machine. The first significant
act was to sign a treaty
g ivin g form al efTect to British
pledges of aid to Poland. The treaty
w ill run for five years.
A nother important w ar m ove was
to prohibit dealing in a number of
foreign securities. This action was
interpreted as conscription of wealth.
It is estim ated that $15,000,000,000
w orth of securities w ill be affected
by the order.
D anzig, the Polish corridor and
various sections o f Poland along the
border, these G erm any must have,
is H itler's defiant demand, otherwise
there w ill be w ar. These w ere the
declarations of H itler in a letter to
P re m ie r D aladier o f France. This
revealed for the first time officially
H itler’s full demands on Poland.
“ F o r a nation with honor it is im possible
to relinquish a population of
2,000,000 o f its compatriots at its
border,'* the letter said.
In the m eantim e m obilization of
Germ an m ilitary forces was reaching
its clim ax. N ew w ar m easures
w ere taken. Food and clothing ration
cards w ere distributed. Purchase
of gasoline was restricted.
In Washington it was learned that
President Roosevelt is prepared to
£o the lim it of law and perhaps fa r ther
to swing the power and resources
of the United States tt) the
side o f G reat Britain and F rance in
the event of war. I f he is unable
to procure repeal of the arm s provision
o f the neutrality act, he still
w ill be enabled by certain loopholes
in the legislation to tem per the application
of the em bargo to favored
belligerents. The loopholes are a fforded
by the rules and regulations
on the export o f w ar supplies that
the law leaves to the discretion of
the executive.
F rance, with the greatest force under
arm s since 1919, awaited calm ly
and vigilan tly the outcome of diplom
atic negotiations then under
way. Notices w ere pasted up
throughout the country ordering reservists
to report to their m obilization
centers at once. A pproxim ately
2,300,000 men are now under arms.
While not a general call to arm s this
partial m obilization is sufficient to
provide France with an arm y on a
w artim e footing capable of taking
the offensive as w ell as holding up a
surprise attack until the whole m anpower
o f the cou rtry could be m obilized,
was the general belief in
Paris.
In W arsaw a pall o f depression
settled on the Polish capital. In authoritative
circles it was believed
m ediation by the United States, or
some other equally distinguished
and disinterested third power, was
the only rem aining chance to avoid
European war. This conviction was
crystalized as W arsaw heard from
Pa ris that H itler had refused direct
negotiations with Poland fo r a
peaceful solution of D anzig’s status.
In Rom e P rem ie r Mussolini was
represented 3s w illing, perhaps e a ger,
for negotiations that would
avert w ar. But, along with this.
Fascists emphasized, must be considered
Italian claim s upon F rance
for a greater share in A frican colonial
possessions. II Duce. nevertheless,
pushed m ilita ry preparations.
Hope for peace from an interchange
of m essages between Mussolini and
H itler w as tem pered by the frank
Italian statement that H itler was
seeking to throw on other powers
responsibility for any w ar that m ay
result.

The greatest flood o f w ar propaganda
since the period im m ediately
preceding Am erican entry into the
W orld w ar is deluging the United
States, according to a report made
public by the Dies com m ittee on un-
Am erican acitivities.
The w ar propaganda, according
to the report, is traced to two m ajor
groupings of European nations— the
London-Paris entente and the Berlin-
Rom e axis. Communist Russia is
placed in a separate category. The
most effective w ar propaganda in
this country em anates from Great
Britain, the report said.
“ A lread y wide sections of A m e rican
public opinion have been definitely
m olded to the acceptance of
many oT the ob jectives o f thc current
w ar propaganda em anating from
abroad,” the report said. “ Polls of
Am erican public opinion would seem
to indicate that certain powers (the
London-Paris entente) have won the
first m ajor battle of the next w'ar by
enlisting the preponderant sentiment
of this country on their side.”
The report was com piled by Dr.
J. B. Matthews, director on research
on foreign w ar propaganda for the
com m ittee.
O f all the nations in the world the
United States is the most coveted
prize to be bagged by foreign w ar
propagandists, says the report, as
resources of the United States m ight
w ell be the decisive factor in any
war.
“ When all of the w ar slogans have
been stripped away from the underlying
interests which they conceal,
it is plain on the one hand that c e rtain
nations have em pires and want
to keep them, and other nations do
not have em pires (not imposing
ones, at least) but want to acquire
DR. J. B. M A T T H E W S

them ,” said the report. “ M oscow ’s
special interest—cle a rly established
by its own propaganda o ver many
years— is that these opposing com b inations
shall destroy each other, and
that proletarian revolution and dictatorship
shall be extended on the
ruins of that destruction.”
“ D em ocracy versus dictatorship”
is ch ief among the w ar slogans e m ployed
in this country to conceal
the im perialistic aim s of certain nations,
according to the report.

A s a result of the Russian-German
nonagression pact, a drastic
change in foreign policy has been
decided upon by the Japanese cabinet.
Japan casts itself free from
the ties which bound it to the German-
Italian lineup and em barks on
a course of “ splendid isolation.” The
decision to start all o ver again m et
with the approval o f the entire
cabinet.
It was predicted that later the
governm ent w ill realign its internal
structure, but no inkling was

given as to probable developments.
The governm ent, it was reported,
had abandoned consideration of
m easures to strengthen the anticom
itern pact, which allied Japan
with Rom e, Berlin and Hungary-
Japanese newspapers w ere virtually
agreed that the anti-comitern pact
is dead as a result of the German-
Russian pact.
The Japanese arm y was prompt
in givin g their unqualified approval
to the cabinet’s action in severing
tics with Germ any.
Finding it impossible to m ake
the adjustments made necessary by
the German-Russian pact, the Japanese
cabinet resigned and a new
cabinet is being form ed.
NATIONAL
AFFAIRS
Rtvitw ed by
C ARTER FIELD
The tem/ter o f the f)eople
o f the U nited States is decidedly
against participation
o f any kind in a European
tear . . , Conditions vastly
different front those at the
tim e o f the W orld war . . .
“ B ig business'* confers on
plan to bring about a big
boom in business between
now and January in hofws o f
refu tin g Roosevelt's dire predictions.
W A S H IN G T O N —The greatest difference
of opinion about any one
im portant question in this country
today is w hether the United States
can keep out o f w ar in Europe.
Th ere is no doubt ab ut the tem per
of the country. I f i referendum
could be held tom orrow, nearly all
astute politicians behove it would
go overw h elm in gly fur rem aining
neutral—or, as m ost people put it,
minding our own business.
M oreover, there is no such element
in this country today as there
was im m ed ia tely after the invasion
o f B elgium in 1914, w ich kept increasing
until, in 1915, when the Lusitania
was sunk, it reached a fo rm
idable crest.
On the other hand, there is no
such division o f sentiment in this
country as there wras from 1914 to
1917. In m an y states the G erm an
population openly sym pathized at
that tim e w ith the central powers,
p a rticu larly in the upper Mississippi
va lley , w'hich, as one old political
leader rem arked at the tim e, is
m ore Teutonic than Anglo-Saxon.
Minnesota, fo r instance, contrary to
the b elief o f m ost Easterners and
Southerners, has m ere Germ ans
than Swedes, m ore Germ ans than
N orw egians, though of course if the
Scandinavians are considered as one
racial group, they outnumber the
Germ ans. Wisconsin, Nebraska and
Missouri, not to mention Illinois,
h a ve huge G erm an populations.
But today there is not much sym pathy
for H itler among these G erman
segm ents of our population
which w ere so ferven tly pro-German
in 1914-1917. Most of them still love
G erm any, but they do not like H itler.
Th ere a re plenty of exceptions,
of course, as becom es apparent
when one starts to canvass the situation,
but it is ve ry obvious that instead
o f the G erm an-Am ericans being
a solid pro-Hitler bloc they
would show a substantial m ajo rity
against him. Most G erm an-Am ericans
today would be pleased at the
news o f a political turnover in G erm
any. which would throw H itler and
the N azis out of power. Most of
them would even p refer the return
o f the Hohenzollerns to continuance
o f the present regim e.
N eutrality Laws W ould
N ot K eep LTs Out of tt ar
A ll o t which is cited to show that
this country does not have to tra vel
as fa r now in order to reach the
point w here it would plunge into
the w a r on the side o f B ritain and
F ran ce as it did in 1914-1917. Y et,
although President Wilson was reelected
in N ovem ber, 1916, on a
“ kept us out o f w a r" issue, the country
was in the war just five months
later. So it m ay be w iser to be
con servative in assumptions as to
this country’s rem aining out of w ar
in Europe.
V ery fe w people think that the
present neutrality laws, or for that
m a tter any variation o f them which
anyone has suggested, would keep
this country out of the w ar. A s a
m a tter o f fact, the present law is
ve ry much misnamed. It provides
against the shipment o f “ arm s, am m
unition and the im plem ents of
w a r ” to belligerents. Y e t it has
never been applied to the present
conflict between Japan and China.
Th e answ er is sim ple. The adm
inistration believes that to recog nize
that a state of w ar exists and
consequently to impose an em bargo
would benefit not China but Japan.
The governm ent at Washington
sym pathizes, quite openly, with China,
not Japan, as the Nipponese
are w rathfu lly aware. So it ignores
the spirit of thc law, though observing
the letter. Nobody kicks much,
because the whole country is alm
ost a unit in sym pathizing with
China.
Th ere is no doubt that the sym pathies
of the adm inistration w ill be
even m ore strongly and a ctively on
the side o f Britain and France
against Germ any. H itler w ill know
that.
Plan Boom in Business to
Refute F. Ih R.*s Predictions
H a lf a dozen conferences o f men
whom the N ew Dealers would call
“ big business” have been held in
the last few days on an agenda looking
to a sharp reviva l o f business
betw een now and January, when
congress m eets again.
The idea is to cause such a rev
iv a l o f business, and such an increase
in em ploym ent by private
em ployers, that
of President Rc
o f the defeat
spend-lend bill i
ridiculous to
makers.
.lire predictions
* use velt grow ing out
by congress of the
w ill be m ade to look
the returning law-
It would be little sh oit o f a m ira cle
if anything cam e o f the conferences.
I f business rev ives and
em ploym ent increases, it w ill not
be the result of them. Despite the
pet theory o f certain radicals, business
is not such a cohesive unit in
its operations. As a m atter o f fa ct
no big corporation, even acting
alone, is ev e r inspired by political
m otives in deciding on an en largement
or curtailm ent o f its operations.
When business expands it is always
for one reason, and only one.
Th e sam e is true when it contracts.
Th ere is never any doubt about the
m otive, whether it be based on
sound or poor judgm ent. The m otive
is alw ays profit. When business
sees a chance to m oke a profit
it expands. When it fears losses if
it continues the present scale of operations,
it contracts. It m ay m ake
a m istake in either direction, but
there is never any question about
why it was done.
New Dealers Needn't W orry}
N othing W ill Come o f It
So w hile gentlem en with imposing
names rea lly have been conferring
on this question o f a m anufactured
boom in order to thwart the P re sident,
no N ew D ealer need be w orried.
Nothing w ill com e o f it. I f
the m anagem ent o f any particular
corporation decides that by expanding
it can m ake another 20 cents on
each share during the next six
months, that corporation w ill expand
its operations. I f it figures
that it w ill lose money by continuing
the present rate of production,
it w ill begin laying off men.
One of the few exceptions in history
happened in the ea rly days of
the H oover depression, in the spring
o f 1930, when President H oover induced
a number of railroad and
big business executives to continue
just as they w ere going, when all
the execu tives wanted to cut down.
But that exception only m ade the
“ rule o f% profit” m otive surer because
o f what happened then. E v e
ry corporation that took Mr. Hoov
e r ’s a dvise on that occasion suffered
terrib ly as a result. M r. Hoov
e r w ill alw ays believe that what
he induced these big em ployers to
do softened the blow—cushioned the
decline. But no business m an w'ants
to offer his own surplus to be used
as a cushion.

N ew Y o rk stock m ark et gyrations

N e v e r was this m ore fo rcib ly dem onstrated

But the sam e operators w ill tell

there w ill be a real boom in the

not unlike those of 1915, though the

M o reover, the sam e shrewd operators

T h eir logic is something like this.
Th e United States w ill be the only
country in the w orld capable of e x porting
m any needed products in
any quantities. This goes especially
o f course for m anufactured goods,
rather than raw m aterials, though
the demand even for some ra w m a terials
w ill be prodigious.
See Increased Demand fo r
A ll Kinds o f Supplies
A s a result o f this certain spurt
in m anufacturing, there w ill be increased
demand for electrica l energ
y , fo r coal, fo r all sorts o f things
necessary to the m anufacturing
processes. This w ill spell enormously
increased buying power on the
part of a ve ry large percentage of
the whole population, including coal
miners, oil w orkers, textile w orkers
—everyon e who participates in the
production of m aterials not only by
the factories which do the exporting,
but those which supply them.
With so m any lines busy, o f
course, the buying power of all these
em ployees w ill in turn spread the
prosperity into lines having no connection
with the supplying o f export
trade m aterials. In short, the country
w ill have a huge boom, very
much like the one it began to enjoy
in 1915 as a result of the W orld war.
M oreover, the world demand for
all sorts o f United States products
w ill be much grea ter than it was
then because o f one im portant
change in the w orld situation. During
the W orld w ar, the other big
m anufacturing country that profited
enorm ously w as Japan. It is true
that Japan w as on the A llie s ’ side
during the W orld war, but actually
it did v e ry little fighting. A fte r its
successful raid on Shantung and the
| Germ an-owned islands in the Pa cif-
I ic, Japan virtu ally forgot about the
I w ar, settling down to m aking goods
and selling them at a profit to the
! A llies and the rest o f the world.
This tim e Japan w ill not be able
to take advantage of the sam e op-
| portumty, whether or not she joins
with G erm any and Ita ly in the war.

Moses L a fa yette O ’L e a r y tossed
his soiled pith helm et to a coolie.
Sw eat stream ed down his almost
liver-colored fa ce from a mass of
black hair that curled with quite
un-oriental vigor. He looked like a
vau deville Irish version of a Hindu
without a turban. He squinted tow
ard the setting sun. The Kadur
R iv e r, where it circled the city wall,
w as blood-red.
“ B lo o d !” he rem arked. “ I f I was
superstitious— ”
He entered Captain C arl N orw
ood’s tent. N orw ood’s native se rvant
objected. O ’L ea ry sm ote the
servant. He rem oved a whiskey bottle,
two long tumblers and a siphon
from the ice-box at the rea r, and
cam e out winking at Sergeant Stoddart,
who was shirt-sleeved, sw eating,
muscular and thirsty.
“ Caught y o u !” said Stoddart.
O 'L e a ry grinned. “ A ll you’ re fit
to catch is hell and m alaria. I ’ m
taking pity on you. H e re .” They
sat, on cases o f su rveyors’ instrum
ents, facin g each other. O ’L ea ry
ob served:
“ As a sergeant of sappers, you’ re
a sap sergeant. You believe you’ re
here to find out why the Kadur
R iv e r is all silted up. As if nobody
knew it. Y ou ’ ll sweat. Y ou ’ ll wade.
Y o u ’ll work. Y ou ’ll catch diseases;
and you’ ll draw your pay, if you
live . P re tty soon now you’ ll be sent
hom e on a troop-ship to tell the E n glish
in the pubs how you’d rule India
if you was comm ander-in-chief.
Y o u ’d look handsome in a cocked
ha» ”
“ Kid you rself you know a lot,
don’t you ?” said Stoddart. “ This is
good w hiskey.”
“ Sure I know a lot. I ’ m three
men. Y ou ’re only w hat’ s left of
one, and white at that. I draw onethird
your pay for using three tim es
your brains. You only know what
you’re told, all tripe and arm y regulations.
Hindsight. M in e’s foresight.”
“ Y ou ’ re like all Eurasians,” said
Stoddart. “ Y ou 'd bet on all three
horses in a three-horse race, and
then set you rself up as a cla irvo y ant,
along of having picked the winner.
The secret of why the Kadur
R iv e r has silted up is like a d og’s
bone that he buries in sight of half
the county. The priests have a diamond
mine, and they’re critturs o ’
habit. They dig by day. C om e nighttim
e, they’ve been dumping clay
into the rive r since N oah’ s D elu ge.”
“ Don’t you take the Scriptures in

saint, which is m ore than you are.
Stick to your rive r survey. Watch
out that the dam don’ t break and
learn you what a deluge is. You r
job is to w ork with a dumpy and
tape and a couple o’ poles, and set
down figures to be stuck aw ay in a

o ’ things. I ’ m good at it.”
' ‘I ’ll adm it,” said Stoddart, “ you

What d’ you kid you rself you ’ re here
to find out?”
" I m ight risk givin g you another
drink if you could tell m e w here the
Captain’s heading fo r this m inute.”
“ E a sy ,” said Stoddart. “ Pass the
bottle. Captain N orwood is on his
w ay to the Residency to report a rriv

O ’L ea ry kept his hand on the bottle:
“ What else? ”
“ Nothing else. Regulation routine.

Resident at the court of a Maharajah

ambassador. He attends functions.
And he keeps out o ’ trouble whenev
e r he can. They tell m e this R esident
is a dabster at doing nothing
and keeping it w rapped in cellophane.”
O ’L ea ry passed the bottle: “ Well,
you g et your drink, but you don’t deserve
it. I ’ll bet m y month’s pay
against yours that the Captain’s in
trouble already. Trou b le’s what he
cam e here for. Did you ev er know
Norwood not to get what h e’s
a fte r? ”
“ T h ere’s someone else after som ething,”
said Stoddart, staring over
the rim of his tum bler, beyond
O ’Leary. “ I ’ll bet you know who he
is. And I ’ll bet you know what he
wants, you bleeding ferret. What is
it? ”
“ Y ou ’d better sc ram ,” O 'L e a ry
answered. “ Secrets and sergeants
don’t m ix good.”
Stoddart snorted: “ T h ere you go,
m urdering the K in g’ s English, as
w ell as i%ot minding your own business.
You picked up the word
scram in the m ovies and you think
it ’s clever. The trouble with you is,
Moses, that you try to talk too many
languages, but you can’t shoot a
bee-line in one of them. Talk E n glish.”
“ I w ill,” said O ’L ea ry . “ You
scram . That gentlem an who’s m aking
you so curious is going to have
to talk English too, on account o ’
m y d ignity.”
“ Who is he?”
“ H e’s the oil-can.”
“ M eaning w h at?” asked Stoddart.
“ H e looks greasy enough from the
heat, but you haven’t looked at him,
so you didn't mean that.”
“ A ll right, I ’ll educate you. A fter
that, you scram and learn English.
I ’ m keeping him waiting o ’ purpose.”
“ On account o f your d ign ity?”
“ No. M y dignity is like that bottle

“ You bet it’s hot,” said Stoddart.
“ I t ’s a hundred and five this m inute,
in the shade of m y awning. But
I suppose you didn’t mean that.”
“ I t ’s tough all right,” said
O ’ L ea ry , “ but perhaps Lahore goes

“ I never w as in L a h o re ," said
Stoddart.
“ Th at’s why you’re still in the

m ayb e you’ll get home safe to E n gland
with a pension. Lahore is full
o ’ w om en who’d as soon knife you

“ Y es, I know what you mean.
I ’ ve heard tell o f ’em .”
“ And those women o’ La h ore,”
said Moses O ’ L ea ry , “ are about the
square root o f one-tenth of one per
cent as bad as the men. This man
N oor M ahlam , who is squinting right
now at the back o ’ m y neck, is a
je w e l in the crown o f K a d u r’s infam

“ What do you suppose he w ants?”
asked Stoddart.
“ He wants news, you sapper. He
wants to know why Captain Catchem
-alive-o C arl Norwood is in K a dur.”
“ Y ou ’ ll tell him ?”
“ Bet your boots and m edals I ’ ll
tell him .”
“ W ill you g ive him a drink?”
“ I w ill not. F or the sake o f a
harm less innocent like you I don’t
mind letting down m y dignity at
times. But I wouldn’ t steal Captain
N orw ood’s whiskey for that buz- «
zard.”
" H e doesn’t look like a buzzard.
He looks fa t and good natured.”
Moses L a fa ye tte O ’ L ea ry took a
private sw ig from the bottle inside
N orw ood’s tent, and then put it away
in the chop-box. With his hands in
his trouser pockets for the sake of
dignity, he strode toward the tree
beneath which N oor Mahlam sat
wondering how to broach the subject
o f his m editations. He did not
appear to be wondering. His black
turban only partly concealed a philosopher’s
forehead. His silverbrim
m ed spectacles enhanced the
m ellow mildness o f intelligent dark
brown eyes. His nose was fleshy
and good humored. His black beard
and moustache w ere w ell cared for.
Th ey concealed something. His
mouth w as not in evidence. He arose
to g reet Moses O ’L e a ry and, judging
by the m ovem ent o f his beard,
he sm iled, but the sm ile was invisible.
At close quarters it w as e v ident
that his bulk was m ostly fat,
not muscle. He fitted flabbily into a
bazaar-m ade black alpaca European
suit.
“ H ow d ’you do, N oor M ahlam .”
“ H ow do you do, sir.”
Moses O ’L e a ry straightened him se
lf slightly and d rew his right hand
from his pocket. H e had to live up
to being addressed as “ sir” by a
man o f m eans from the underworld
district. But it stirred his alertness.
His suspicion, and m ore than
that, was already w ide awake. His
voice hardened a trifle:
“ Sit down, N oor Mahlam. Hot,
isn’t it? No, I ’ll stay on m y feet.
I ’ve business to attend to. Can’ t
spare you m ore than a minute or
tw o.”
“ How did you know m y name,
s ir ? ” asked N oor Mahlam in silky
accents that suggested there was
something else than silk beneath.
It w as a quiet agreeable voice, unless
one listened to it too attentively.
Moses O ’L e a ry sm iled with the
pride o f the expert who needs no
praise to ju stify his self-esteem :
“ I t ’s m y job to know things. Check
m e. You w ere a law yer. You served
a term in prison in Cawnpore for
cheating a client. You w ere disbarred.
And now you ’re cheating
everybod y. Am I rig h t? ”
“ Sir, I ’m a public relations counselor.
It is a new profession, in
India.”
“ I t ’s a new nam e fo r an old
g am e,” said O ’L ea ry . “ But you’ve
com e to the right place. I ’m the
publicity man o ’ this surveying party.
What do you w ant?”
N oor M ahlam looked bland and
innocent. His eyes w ere as kind
as the m ilk o f the moon, but his
mouth rem ained hidden. He wiped
the sw eat off his face with a handkerchief,
then rem oved his spectacles
and wiped them too, before he
answered:
“ I want nothing, Mr. O ’L e a ry .”
“ Y ou ’re a lucky b lo k e!”
“ I cam e to enquire if I can be
useful. I f I could have the ear of
your officer— ”
“ I ’m it. I ’m both ears. I ’ m his
teacher, his keeper, his nurse, his
confidential secret’ry, his father confessor
and information m an.”
“ Sir, if you are truly in Captain
N orw ood’s confidence— ”
“ T r y me. Him and m e are like
the two sides of a rupee. And it’s
a two-headed rupee. H e’d believe
m e even if I was to tell him you’ re
honest.”
“ I could reciprocate, Mr. O ’ Leary.
Th ere are m any people to whom it
is highly im portant to know why
Captain Norwood is in Kadur.”
“ H a ve you heard about the survey
of the Kadur R iv e r? ”
“ Y es, M r. O ’ Leary, but nobody
believes that.”
“ W ell, it’s the fact. W e’re here
to run a su rvey of the Kadur R iv e r .”
“ A h ! But o f what else than the
river? I am commissioned to offer
rupees fifty for correct inform ation.”
“ And m e a poor m an! I f I w eren’t
a good Christian and afraid to take
the nam e of the Lord in vain, I ’d be
critica l o ’ your conscience. D ’you
think it’s decent to insult m y poverty
with an offer o ’ fifty rupees?”
“ Sir, I m ight make it a hundred.”
“ Y ou ’ ll have to m ake it tw ice that
before I ’ ll hesitate. Besides, I don’ t
think I need you.”
“ M r. O ’L ea ry , I think you underestim
ate m y value. Th ere is nothing
that I don’t know about the
politics o f Kadur. I am the trusted
inform ant o f people in ve ry high
places.”
“ H igh ?” said O ’Lea ry. “ In the
m agistrates’ courts they call ’em
low places. You can go look for another
customer. Captain N orw ood’s
decent.”
“ Ah, but how about you?”
“ I know how to take ca re o’ m yself.
W'hat d ’you take m e for? A
tourist?
“ Sahib, I can tell you actual, authentic
facts about the palace.”
Th e word “ sahib” was a mistake.
It stiffened O ’L e a r y ’s feeling of superiority.
It spurred him to contemptuous
offensive tactics:
“ I don’ t believe you. What’s new
at the pa la ce?”

Ancient Jewish Coins Found to Be of Historical Value
An exhibit o f ancient Jewish coins
sym bolic of the Maccabean period,
displayed at a Jewish theological
sem inary in N ew Y ork recently,
presented an interesting insight into
the customs and law s of that early
day.
The coins, struck in the two centuries
preceding and follow ing the
start o f the Christian era, are of
silver, gold and copper. They are
o f two classifications— those struck
by the Jews them selves and those
minted by their various Roman g o vernors.
Because Jewish law forbids the
use o f graven im aged, there are few
portrait heads in the collection. The
most com m on d ecora tive motifs are
sacred objects— the jug. the palm
branch, the citron, the holy tabernacle,
trumpet, the Menorah and
the palm tree, the last a sym bol of
plenty in Palestine.
Th ere is little of artistic m erit in
the collection. A pparently the M accabean
coins w ere strictly u tilitarian,
for the Jew s who coined them
wasted little tim e displayed at the
Jewish T h eological beautiful. Many
o f them have been struck over old
Rom an coins, and in their haste the
Jew ish craftsm en failed to oblitera
te the Roman inscriptions.
The speed with which these coins
w ere made is dem onstrated, in
som e instances, by im perfect im print.
Some of these imprintings
co ver only half the fa ce of the old
Rom an coins. Coins o f the revolu- j
tionary period bear the Hebrew in- I
scription, “ To the freedom of Jerusa
lem ,” and the date, 1, 2, 3, or 4,
corresponding to the y ea r of the
revolt.
In the second group of coins—
those struck by the Rom an governors—
much of historical value is revealed.
Many o f the bear profile
portraits of Vespasian, Domitian or
Titus, in whose reigns they w ere |
struck off.
Many of the coins issued by the
Rom an procurators o f Palestine
show a Jewish influence. These
coins do not bear the Roman initials
“ S. C .,“ since they w ere struck
without the authority o f the senate
and m erely at the em p eror’s com mand.
This was possible, since
Palestine rem ained an im perial
province.
Som e of the coins w ere em bellished
with reproductions of inanim
ate creatures instead o f the reigning
Caesar.

F ig h tin g Soviet hi’ car„ee,r fighting the Bolsheviks,

has been considerably em barrassed
at being drawn into the new apparently
broken fellowship with Russia.
It has been clear that being saved
by Russia was the least and last
o f his ideas.
He is beyond doubt the ablest of
Poland’s m ilita ry leaders, and, once
the bell rings, there is no question
that he can and w ill fight, as he
proved in the cam paigns to free
Poland and in his forays against
early-day Bolshevik Russia.
H e n ever has quite come

there w as one of those “ ideologica

to em erge as the head of reconstructed
Poland. Handsome
and imposing, of dominant
bearing, he looked the part, but
he couldn’t seem to m anage ihe
big talk necessary for the job.
The best they could get out of
him was something to the genera

On August 6 of this year, when it

he w as expected to m ake a sizzling
speech at Cracow. His audience
was howling for a knockout punch,
but the speech was m ostly shadowboxing,
with nothing specific about
what he proposed to do about

out there.

M ay Be V ery political leaders
Cute P o litic , are sal* ‘° be s o m e w h a t e m barrassed
by the aged governor’*
alarm ed discovery of wickedness in
high places, the word is that his
forces have been intrenched and
widened since he let loose about
the drinking and dancing orgies o f
the A lbany conference of governors.
His Bible class at Eaton, Mich., is
crow ded to the doors and he is
besieged with requests for lectures
and participation in reviva l cam paigns.
Currently he tells a gathering
of Chicago and D etroit “ pupils”
that this Albany conference was
pretty much like B elshazzar’s feast
and that our Babylonian wastrels
w ill drag us down if w e don’t mend
our ways.
F o r 25 years, M r. Dickinson
has held in fee sim ple the antisin
vote of Michigan. It has
held steadily around 200,000
votes, undivided in its allegiance
in his repeated forays against
ev il, chief of which has been his
still continuing prohibition battle.
H e is a spare, bald evangel
of righteousness, his friendly
eyes glinting behind his octagonal
rim m ed glasses when he
is aroused, his m eager fram e
shaken with pietistic fervor. He
em ploys much of the lexicon of
the late Dr. Parkhurst of N ew
Y ork, in assailing sin, and some
of his philippics seem to voice
again the pious horror of the
author of “ N ew York by Gaslight,”
w ritten 60 years ago.
He is a native of N ew York, born
near Lockport in N iaga ra county.
His parents rem oved to Eaton,
Mich., when he w as a sm all boy.
Th ere he still lives, happily engaged
with his Methodist church
Bible class, and, m ore recently,
with the state o f Michigan and, unhappily
for his peace o f mind, in a
bout with ev il which he never knew
existed before.
Shays’s rebellion of 1786 jolted the
big-town politicians with a rea lization
of what a m ixture of a gra rian
discontent and old-tim e religion
m ay amount to. In G overnor Dickinson’s
com pact voting phalanx,
things are something like that. His
allied conservative Republican organization
appreciates all this.

W h a t's the A n sw e r?
By EDWARD T1NCH
Contributed fit/ 'Spud'
Thanks, old “ Ped” (short fo r peda-|
gogue). W e appreciate a bouquet too!
Dear “ Oz ’n ’em”
I fo r one wish to thank you for the
article in this week’s Enterprise. I am
an “ old” teacher and have seen the
young teachers come with their “ fanfa
re ” . Give many programs— o f very
little consequence— to entertain thej
mothers and the school board wives, I
and seen them swallow the “ fan-fare” |
hook, line and sinker. They never]
stopped to consider how much schooltime
that entertainment took.
In the school I was in last year the
teachers complained bitterly of all thej
activity, saying it was just impossible
to g et the regular amount o f work ac-1
complished. Seems a shame that)
the parents do not realize the situation!
and do something about it. Soon our
schools w ill have “ book learning” as a
secondary measure and the extras the
primary.
Thank you again, and especially so
fo r your kind words about the old ex-i
perienced teacher.
Sincerely, an Old Teacher. [
Dumb— and how!
Last Saturday night a visitor at the
Rosholt F air was more than threesheets
to the wind. He joined a group
o f Poles who had a few drinks under
their belts and began with drunken
abandon to shout: “ Heil, H itler! Heil,j
H itle r!” A bystander stepped up toj
inebriate and leading him away commented,
“ You’d better not shout that
if you want to get home without having
your head cracked!” Dumb? And
how! I dare say there is no individual
in the world who is less popular than
Der Fuehrer, and there would be no
group who could be more infuriated by
the Nazi salute than a group o f Polish
men.

And then just suppose

Now the Leader comes out with an
editorial telling how the eastern part
- f the county, or in other words the
Highway 45 club has cost Shawano a
! great deal o f tourist trade. For
j years the C ity o f Shawano had the
| county board under their control and
j could get anything they asked for.
I Those horse and buggy days are gone.
Certainly towns fought the move to
have highway 45 go through Shawano.
W’ hy not ? Shawano has its share o f
state highways.
Brother Heal, come over and watch
the traffic of foreign licensed cars
from Friday o f this week until over
Labor Day.
The City of Shawano has done their
share to try and divert traffic via their
city.— Birnamwood News.
— ■■ - ..... - m • -----
The Shawano Leader really let the
cat out-of-the-bag when they started
moaning about the increasing traffic
on highway 45. The westerners really
got the best o f the city slickers that
time.— Marion Advertiser.

•‘ W ell, goo’ -by, Mother, an' I
promise I w on’t be late if Flash can
walk part w ay with me. He doesn't
want to stay in that hot ol* doghouse
all day, and you and Dad don’t pay
no attention to him.

In an editorial taken from th*-
Shawano Leader its editor bemoans
the fact that the improvement o f highway
45 has taken much traffic that
would otherwise have gone through i
Shawano. The paper maintains that
the scenic beauty of highway 47
through the reservation should attract
these people, but because “ the H ighway
45 club arterialized the traffic of!
the south to Eagle River in such :i
way that about all the traffic we get j
now that goos to the popular vacation
land is the stragglers.”
W e agree with the Leader that itj
has taken much work and effort to I
bring increased traffic over highway
45. And it took more than that. When j
the Highway 45 club was organized
this highway was about the “ worst j
highw ay” in the state. But constant
effort has brought about a change J
The highway is now one o f the best!
in the state and that is one reason]
that the traffic go, m over this high
way.
The city o f Shawano didn’t help the!
people on highway 45 when the c’ ub
was tryin g to get the highway improved
so those Shawano county pec -1
pie living on it might get an all-ym r
highway. And those people didn’t lik
it very much. But this is history now
so we had better forget about it and
work together to promote more traffic
this way. And one way that Shawano
can do it is to work for the im provement
o f highw ay 47 south of Bonduel.
There may have been some work done
on it this summer, but early in the
season when we rode over it, it was so
rough we vowed we wouldn’t ride over
it again. I f Shawano succeeds in
bringing about that improvement it
will immediately start increasing the
traffic over highway 47 to the north.
It is a beautiful highw ay and it is one
that this part o f the state has an opportunity
to cash in on. So instead of
bemoaning the fact that it has been
losing traffic, Shawano >hvuld get

THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SUCCESS
WE O F T E N gay when w e discuss
variou s things w e acquire
that it isn’ t the original cost that
counts. It is the upkeep. Th is is
p a rticu larly true of success.
Th e fa ct is that there is a responsibility
of success which fa ilu re
or m ed iocrity never knows. The
man who is successful, who achieves
in w h atever line he m ay en ter, has
an obligation and a responsibility
which requires that he continue to
do his ve ry best.
E specially Is this true of business.
T o m ake a brief success of a business
isn't hard. T o huild a lasting
success requires close application
and a fine sense ol the obligation
which success Im plies and dem ands.
I f advertising serve J no other purpose
than to create the obligation
o f success it would
p erform a useful social
and econom ic
act, fo r advertising
holds up this ob ligation
of success and
dem ands that it be
observed constantly
W henever a manufactu
rer or a m erchant
begins to advertise
he sets selfim
posed standards
on him self. B y these
standards do others
ju dge him. B y these standards do
they also cla ssify him.
H e has an obligation to live up to
e v e r y day thenceforward.
M
Charles Koth
I f he hadn’t advertised, he could
g iv e good q u a lity one day and poor
quality the next and get by with it.
But when he com es out boldly in
print and advertises, the die is cast,
and he must fo re v e r liv e up to the
highest ideals.
Shrewd m en h ave thought that
they could con trovert this law. By
putting quality and good valu e into
a product and then by advertising
it, they h a ve succeeded in a short
tim e in building up a big business.
And then cam e tem ptation.
"W h y m aintain all this q u a lity?”
they ask them selves. The public
w ill n ever know. W hy not cut the
qu ality but continue the advertising
and clean up? T h ey have tried. But
the public does know quality, is
quick to p e rc e iv e deception, and
abandons the m an or product which
tries to substitute in feriority fo r honest
m erchandise.
Th ere is no q u icker w ay to ruin
a business than to set up a standard
and then vio la te it. T h ere is no better
w a y to build a business than to
set up a standard and then liv e up
to it.
A d vertisin g is the grea t setter o f
standards in A m e rica n business life ,
and advertised goods are the standards
by which you spend your incom
e, confident o f g ettin g your mone
y ’ s worth e v e r y day.
Th e m an who a d vertisrs has assumed
the responsibility for success.
Y ou ’d rath er deal with a responsible
man, wouldn't you?

“ A Ride With Death”
He l l o e v e r y b o d y :
M a ry Billard o f L a Salle, 111., is today’ s Distinguished
Adventu rer, and she wins that distinction— as w ell as the w ellknown
ten bucks—with one o f the m ost terrifyin g yarns I ’ ve
seen in a long time.
It happened in 1913, when M rs. B illard was Miss M ary
Blanch, a g irl of tw elve, and M ary says, “ The La Salle papers
called m e a heroine at the tim e, and it was all quite exciting for
a g irl o f m y age, but it lost its th rill when I thought of m y
mother lyin g in a hospital in a c ritica l condition, fighting the
dangers o f gangrene and lock ja w .”
Y ou can see from that statem ent of M a ry ’ s that there was
tragedy in that episode as w ell as adventure. And it started
with nothing but a common, ordinary buggy ride. T h ere w eren’ t
so m any automobiles in those days, and m ost of the streets w ere
- J m ere unpaved dirt roads.
M a ry ’ s dad had bought a horse that had spent all its life on
race tracks and was hard to handle when hitched to a buggy.
It had run aw ay twice, and M a ry ’ s m other didn't d rive it any
oftener than she had to.
But there cam e a day when she fe lt she H A D to d rive
| that horse. They had just m oved into town, and M a ry was
finishing a term ;it a little country schoolhouse three m iles out of La
| Salle. M a ry 's teacher was com ing back with her that evening, so M other
hitched up the horse and started out to get them.
M other hadn’t been feeling w ell all that day, but she m ade the trip
to the schoolhouse without any trouble. Th ey w ere all on their w ay to
town, w ith M a ry in the m iddle betw een her m other and the teacher, when,
without w arning, M ary felt her m other fa ll aw ay from her.
M ary Looked Around and Saw H er M other.
She looked around just in tim e to see M other topple from tha
seat and pitch headlong into the road. She had fainted.
But that was only the beginning of a disastrous train of events.
M other had fallen out with the lines still clutched in her hands.
T h e sudden jerk on those reins, caused by her fa llin g, frightened
the horse. It gave a leap forw ard.
" A n d with that lea p,” says M a ry, “ there started the fastest
ride I had ev er rem em bered in all m y 12 years.
“ W e w ere horrified at the situation. Th e horse w as plunging along
t t a full gallop, and m y m other w as being dra gged fa ce downw ard o ver

H er fath er had g iven her a new
Car. Dressed in the latest style,
she flashed through the country. Sad
to relate, she cam e to g r ie f at a
j railw a y crossing.
She em e rg e d from the ruin of
her ca r, took out her vanity bag,
and, oblivious of the crow d, proceeded
to powder her nose.
Th e engin e-driver of the express
1 and others gathered round, and the
d riv e r asked:
“ Why on earth didn’t you stop at
j the crossing until you w ere sure the
road was c le a r ? ”
A fter she had powdered her nose
to the required tint, she turned to
the d r iv e r and cried :
“ I sounded m y horn before you
blew your w h istle."
D og and a H alf
On a rain y day Mrs. B — allowed
her young son to play with a few
silv er coins. H e had one silver dollar
and one half dollar which he
persisted in calling two dollars.
F in a lly she convinced him he had
one dollar and a half. L a te r in the
day a la rg e dog trotted by with a
sm all dog at its side. Sonny looking
out the door looked questioningly
at his m other and said:
“ D og and a ha lf?”

“ I pulled and jerked at the reins until I brought the horse to a stop.”
1 stones and gravel, in a w a y that struck terror into m y heart. Th e
teacher and I w ere helpless.
"W e called and scream ed to m other, pleading with her to let go of
the lines, but all our scream in g w as useless, fo r m other w as in an unconscious
condition, clinging to those reins with a death g rip w hile th*
| horse dra gged her along.”
And, for half a m ile, m other dragged along beside the reeling
w agon, in im m inent danger of rolling under the wheels, w hile up
In the seat M ary and the teacher sat paralyzed with fe a r, tryin g
to hang on to the sw aying, reeling buggy.
M a ry says that buggy w as running on two w heels a good part o f the
time. And at other tim es it seem ed to be flying through the air, with
nothing under the wheels at all.
S evera l men along the road had tried to stop the horse, but couldn't
do anything with the crazed anim al. A t last, at the end o f a h a lf a m ile,
m other’* hands loosened on the reins and the lines w ere free. They got
between the horse’ s front legs, and that only served to frighten th*
' poor anim al more.
T h e Careening C arriage F lew Down the Road.
Still the reeling, careening c a rria g e flew on. Th ey had covered m ore
than a m ile, and now they w ere within a short distance o f a narrow
cu lvert, just outside o f the business section o f L a Salle. Th ere w ere
pillars on either side o f it, and it would be a m iracle if the crazed hors*
got through that cram ped space without w recking the buggy.
The teacher was the first one to think of that culvert. She
scream ed to M a ry that if the horse couldn't be stopped before
they reached it they would both be killed.
"A n d with her voice still ringing in m y ea rs,” says M ary,
“ she rose lo her feet, stood on them for a m om ent on the sw aying
floor of the buggy— and ju m p ed ! I shut m y eyes as I heard her
body hit the road, and thought that surely she must have been
killed .”
And now, M a ry w as left alone in that speeding buggy. She knew
that, somehow, she had to get hgld o f those reins that w ere dragging
down there beneath the horse’s feet. Just a little w ay ahead, now, was
the culvert. And even if the bu ggy did get through the cu lvert, it was
certain to crash into something in the business district two blocks beyond.
So, while the buggy reeled and swayed, M a ry began clim bing o ver
the dashboard, onto the horse's back.
It w as a desperay: chance. T im e and again M a ry alm ost lost her hold
in that precarious trip. The horse w as slippery with foam and perspiration,
and only by bracing her feet against the shaft did she m anage to
keep from being thrown into the road.
" I reached the horse’ s h e a d ." she says, “ and the fe el of my
body on her seem ed to frighten her all the m ore, and m ake her
go faster than ev er. But I got the lines from between her legs
and started in ch in g,m y w ay back to the b u ggy.”
" I pulled and jerk ed at the reins until I brought the horse to a
h a lt," she says, “ and it stopped just a few feet in front o f the dreaded
culvert. A boy ran up to hold the anim al, and I left the buggy and ran
into town to get a doctor for m other. She was still unconscious when
they brought her in, and to this day she carries, on the right side of her
fa re, thc terrible m arks of that horrifying ex p erien ce."
M ary snys she's glad the horse and buggy days are over because—
w e ll—because she wouldn't want any of her children to have such an
experience.

F a rm ers who graze cattle in
woodlands lose m oney both in m ilk
or beef and in tim ber and erosion
control.
E xperim en ts have shown that
m anaged woodlands y ield an annual
return o f about $4 per acre, and
that the best open pastures yield
about the sam e amount. H ow ever,
when grazing and forestry are com- J
bined on the sam e area, the yields
are much less, the total annual return
for typ ical woodland pasture
being only $1 per acre.
Why do fa rm ers run their cattle
in the woods? Th ere is only one
logical reason: Th ey think they can
pick up an extra dollar or two by
I letting the cattle pick a few’ buds and

E ven though you expect everyone
to have had a noon m eal with staying
pow er on Sundays, people do
like to eat when Sunday evening
rolls ’ round! T o be sure, they like
food that’s somewhat lighter, and
food that’s out of the ordinary. So
it ’s a grand tim e to leave the beaten
path and serve something a little
different.

serve them in a new w ay or with

A fter investigating several cases
of salt poisoning, veterinarians have
found that m ost fa rm ers are unaw
are that salt is poisonous to hogs
if given in too la rg e quantities.
A good exam ple of such a case
was a fa rm e r who had 222 head of
pigs which had been vaccinated
with both virus and serum ; seven
of the group had died seven days
after the vaccination and four m ore
w ere sick. The fa rm er blamed the
! treatm ent. The sick pigs wandered
j about the pen in a daze, gradually
I w eakening until com pletely para-
! lyzed. Death soon followed. The
ow ner said the pigs seem ed to cra ve
j something, so he set out several
blocks o f m edicated salt. A number
of the pigs ate considerable
amounts from the block, he continued.
The salt w as rem oved from
the pens and no further losses oc-
| curred.
A fter observing several cases of
; salt poisoning, Dr. H efferd says that
inflam m ation of the kidneys and
bladder, together with a hardening
1 of the live r, are the most comm on
effects of too much salt in the ra-
I tion.
As a rule hogs require little salt
in the ration and the practice of
I m ixing salt with the feed or soaking
mash feeds in salt w ater should be
discouraged, as a brine is likely to
form which m ay cause acute poisoning
with death follow ing quickly,
leaving post-morten findings som ewhat
indefinite.

Successful farm in g is not easy. It
requires much experience in doing
the various kinds of farm work and
the ability to show others how to do
this work. It requires training in
business m anagem ent and knowledge
o f the principles of plant
growth, the feeding and care of animals,
and the m aintenance o f soil
fertility. F ew industries require
such a w ide range o f training and
experience. F arm in g is not sim ply
grow in g a particular crop or fe ed ing
a certain kind o f live stock. It
is an all-the-year-round business, invo

plants and anim als and the successful
organization o f the varyin g farm
enterprises into a sm oothly w orking
unit.
IT ’S no secret as to who has been
chosen to play the part o f leading
lady on the stage of fashion
during the ea rly fall days—College
G irl is her name. To this im portant
personage all fashiondom is
paying hom age at the present m oment.
On e v ery side you are reminded
that the idea is m otivating
to cater to the whims and wardrobe
needs o f the girl who is going
away to school.
The style program arranged for
Miss C ollege G irl and her younger
schoolgirl sister fa irly teem s with
excitem ent. F or instance, there is
the new’ bustle dress. The idea has
taken the collegiate set by storm.
The quaint bustle dresses that
grandmothers galavanted in as girls
in the ’80s are actually proving
inspiration for frocks that the modern
girl w ill w ear this fall.
The highpoints of these oldtime
silhouettes are being revived such
as waistlines of vanishing inches,
slim corseted m idriffs and wide
back-swirling skirts interpreted in
novel bustle treatm ents but m odified
so cle ve rly they are made thoroughly
practical and w earable for
this day and age. Then there is the
new vogue that calls for a velvet or
velveteen jacket worn with a gay
plaided wool skirt or a contrasting or
matched solid color as fancy dictates.
The decided m ilita ry air that
the new fashions take on is also a
big factor in the new mode and
most outstanding of all is the im portance
attached to fine m aterials.
These and other significant style
trends w ere revealed at their glam orous
best in an advance fall fashion
revue staged by the Style C reators
of Chicago. Th e three models
pictured w ere especially applauded
by the audience o f visiting m erchants
as fashions that are representative
of what the up-to-date
fashion-alert girl w ill be selecting
for her going-away-to-school wardrobe.
The cle ve r little date frock of
shepherd check velveteen shown to
the left in the group is sure to enjoy
a gay campus career. Its cunning
tunic bustleback and its full circular-
cut skirt gives it swank and distinction
such as collegiate fashionables

V l ^ H E R E there is a fam ily of children
and the means are limit- :
ed, it often becom es necessary for ;
the older children to give as much |
help as they possibly can, not only 1
with the housework but w’ith the
care o f the little ones, and the tasks
are usually accepted cheerfully.
But good judgm ent is needed in ;
such situations. The mother must !
rem em b er that the older children |
are still immature, and that they j
should not be called upon for work 1
that is too difficult or too continuous.
What m ay seem light—not at

be quite tiring to a boy or girl, and '
j a child is entitled to a happy youth I
as fa r as can be managed. Then |
the little ones—even a single little |

will keep a close watch of the gen-

i child is dealt with fairly.
In order that the mother herself i

irritable by too many demands upon j
her strength and time, it m ay be
necessary for her to sim plify the
household program as far as possible.

garm ents and sheets do not actually
require ironing. I f they are sweet

that is necessary. The beds w ill

Ride W ith Death”
He l l o e v e r y b o d y :
M a ry B illard of L a Salle, 111., is today’ s Distinguished
A dventurer, and she wins that distinction— as w ell as the w ellknown
ten bucks—with one o f the m ost terrify in g yarns I ’ ve
seen in a long time.
It happened in 1913, when M rs. B illard was Miss M ary
Blanch, a g irl of tw elve, and M ary says, ‘ ‘The L a Salle papers
called m e a h e r o in e at the tim e, and it was all quite excitin g for
a g irl o f m y a g e , but it lost its th rill when I thought o f m y
m other lyin g in a hospital in a c ritica l condition, fighting the
dangers o f gangrene and lock jaw .”
Y ou can see from that statem ent o f M a ry ’ s that there was
tragedy in that episode as w ell as adventure. And it started
with nothing but a common, ordinary buggy ride. T h ere w eren ’ t
so m any automobiles in those days, and m ost o f the streets w ere
m ere unpaved dirt roads.
M a ry ’ s dad had bought a horse that had spent a ll its life on
race tracks and was hard to handle when hitched to a buggy.
It had run aw ay tw ice, and M a ry ’ s m other didn’ t d rive it any
oftener than she had to.
But there cam e a day when she fe lt she H A D to d rive
that horse. They had just m oved into town, and M ary was
finishing a term at a little country schoolhouse three m iles out o f La
Salle. M a ry 's teacher w as com ing back with her that evenin g, so M other
hitched up the horse and started out to g et them.
M other hadn’t been feelin g w ell all that day, but she m ade the trip
to the schoolhouse without any trouble. Th ey w ere all on their w a y to
town, with M a ry in the m iddle between her m other and the teacher, when,
without w arning, M ary fe lt her m other fa ll a w ay from her.
M ary Looked Around and Saw H er M other.
She looked around just in tim e to see M other topple from tha
seat and pitch headlong into the road. She had fainted.
But that was only the beginning of a disastrous train of events.
M other had fallen out with the lines still clutched in her hands.
T h e sudden jerk on those reins, caused by her fallin g, frightened
the horse. It gave a leap forw ard.
"A n d with that lea p,” says M a ry , “ there started the fastest
ride I had ev e r rem em bered in all m y 12 years.
“ W e w ere horrified at the situation. Th e horse w as plunging along

D og and a H a lf
On a rainy day Mrs. B— allowed
her young son to play with a few
silver coins. He had one silver dollar
and one half dollar which he
persisted in callin g tw o dollars.
Finally she convinced him he had
one dollar and a half. L a te r in the
day a la rg e dog trotted by with a
sm all dog at its side. Sonny looking
out the door looked questioningly
at his m other and said:
“ D og and a h a lf? ”

stones and gravel, in a w ay that struck terro r into m y heart. Th e
teacher and I w ere helpless.
" W e called and scream ed to m other, pleading with her to let g o of
the lines, but all our scream in g w as useless, fo r m other w as in an unconscious
condition, clinging to those reins with a death g rip w hile the
horse dragged her alon g.”
And, for half a m ile, m other dragged along beside the reeling
w agon, in im m inent danger of rolling under the w heels, w hile up
tn the seat M a ry and the teacher sat paralysed with fe ar, tryin g
to hang on to the sw aying, reeling buggy.
M a ry says that buggy was running on tw o wheels a good part o f the
tim e. And at other tim es it seem ed to be flyin g through the air, with
nothing under the w heels at all.
S everal men along the road had tried to stop the horse, but couldn't
| do anything with the crazed anim al. A t last, at the end of a h a lf a m ile,
j m other’* hands loosened on the reins and the lines w ere free. Th ey got
between the horse’ s front legs, and that only served to frighten tha
poor anim al more.
The Careening C arriage F lew Down the Road.
Still the reeling, careening ca rria g e flew on. Th ey had covered m ore
than a m ile, and now they w ere within a short distance o f a narrow
cu lvert, just outside o f the business section o f L a Salle. T h ere w ere
pillars on either side o f it, and it would be a m ira c le if the crazed horse
1 got through that cram ped space without w reck ing the buggy.
The teacher was the flrst one to think o f that culvert. She
scream ed to M a ry that if the horse couldn't be stopped before
they reached it they would both be killed.
"A n d with her voice still ringing in m y ea rs,” says M ary,
"sh e rose to ber feet, stood on them for a m om ent on the sw aying
floor of the buggy— and ju m p ed ! I shut m y eyes as I heard her
body hit the road, and thought that surely she must have been
killed.1'
And now, M a ry w as left alone in that speeding buggy. She knew
that, somehow, she had to get hgld o f those reins that w ere draggin g
down there beneath the horse’ s feet. Just a little w ay ahead, now, was
the culvert. And even if the buggy did get through the cu lvert, it was
certain to crash into something in the business district two blocks beyond.
So, while the bu ggy reeled and sw ayed, M a ry began clim bing o v er
the dashboard, onto the horse's back.
It was a d e s p e ra ^ chance. T im e and again M a ry alm ost lost her hold
in that precarious trip. The horse w as slippery with foam and perspiration,
and only by bracing her feet against the shaft did she m anage ta
keep from being thrown into the road.
" I reached the horse's head.” she says, “ and the fe el o f m y
bodv on her seem ed to frighten her all the m ore, and m ake her
go faster than ev er. But I got the lines from between her legs
and started inching1m y w ay back to the b u ggy.”
" I pulled and jerk ed at the reins until I brought the horse to a
halt,” she says, "a n d it stopped just a few feet in front of the dreaded
culvert. A boy ran up to hold the anim al, and I left the buggy and ran
into town to get a doctor for mother. She w as still unconscious when
they brought her in, and to this day she carries, on the right side of her
face, the terrible m arks of that h orrifying experien ce.”
M ary says she's glad the horse and buggy days are o ver because—
w e ll—because she wouldn't want any of her children to have such an

E ven though you expect everyone
to have had a noon m eal with staying
pow er on Sundays, people do
like to eat when Sunday evening
rolls ’round! T o be sure, they like
food that’s som ewhat lighter, and
food that's out o f the ordinary. So
it ’s a grand tim e to leave the beaten
path and serve something a little
different.
I f you serve left-overs, be sure to
serve them in a new w ay or with
an unusual accom

These menus are suited, too, to

F a rm ers who g ra ze ca ttle in
woodlands lose m oney both in m ilk
or b eef and in tim ber and erosion
control.
E xperim en ts have show’n that
m anaged woodlands y ield an annual
return o f about $4 per acre, and
that the best open pastures yield
about the sam e amount. H ow ever, |
w hen grazing and forestry are com- |
bined on the sam e area, the yields
are much less, the total annual return
for typical woodland pasture
being only $1 per acre.
W hy do farm ers run their cattle
in the woods? Th ere is only one
logical reason: Th ey think they can
pick up an extra dollar or two by
letting the cattle pick a few* buds and
tw igs in ea rly spring, along with
the low-grow’ ing plants and a few
sprigs of grass or briars which
m ay grow w here a fe w rays of
sunlight reach the ground.
Xhis is a fallacy. A fa rm er
doesn’ t pick up an extra dollar or
tw o; the cow's do not produce as
much m ilk or as much beef as
w'hen they graze in open pasture;
the tim ber supply is reduced; g ra zing
woodlands induces erosion and
loss of lea f litte r; the fencing biU
is higher.

Successful farm in g is not easy. It
requires much experien ce in doing
the various kinds o f fa rm w ork and
the ability to show others how to do
this work. It requires training in
business m anagem ent and knowledge
o f the principles o f plant
growth, the feeding and ca re o f anim
als, and the m aintenance o f soil
fe rtility. F ew industries require
such a w ide range o f training and
experience. F arm in g is not sim ply
grow in g a particular crop or feed ing
a certain kind o f live stock. It
is an all-the-year-round business, invo
lvin g the production o f various
plants and anim als and the successful
organization o f the va ry in g farm
enterprises into a sm oothly w orking
unit.
I T ’S no secret as to who has
* chosen to play the part of leading
lady on the stage of fashion
during the ea rly fall days—C ollege
G irl is her nam e To this im portant
personage all fashiondom is
paying hom age at the present m oment.
On e v e ry side you are reminded
that the idea is m otivating
to cater to the whims and w ardrobe
needs o f the girl who is going
aw ay to school.
The style program arranged for
Miss C ollege G irl and her younger
schoolgirl sister fairly teem s with
excitem ent. F or instance, there is
the new bustle dress. The idea has
taken the collegiate set by storm.
The quaint bustle dresses that
grandm others galavanted in as girls
in the ’80s are actually proving
inspiration fo r frocks that the modern
girl w ill w ear this fall.
The highpoints of these oldtim e
silhouettes are being revived such
as waistlines of vanishing inches,
slim corseted m idriffs and wide
back-sw'irling skirts interpreted in
novel bustle treatm ents but modified
so c le ve rly they are made thoroughly
practical and w earable for
this day and age. Then there is the
new vogue that calls for a velvet or
velveteen jacket w’orn wfith a gay
plaided wool skirt or a contrasting or
matched solid color as fancy dictates.
The decided m ilita ry air that
the new fashions take on is also a
big factor in the new mode and
most outstanding o f all is the im portance
attached to fine materials.
These and other significant style
trends w ere revealed at their glam orous
best in an advance fa ll fashion
revue staged by the Style C reators
of Chicago. Th e three models
pictured w ere especially applauded
by the audience o f visiting m erchants
as fashions that are representative
of what the up-to-date
fashion-alert girl w ill be selecting
for her going-away-to-school w ardrobe.
The clever little date frock of
shepherd check velveteen shown to
the left in the group is sure to enjoy
a gay campus career. Its cunning
tunic bustleback and its full circular-
cut skirt gives it swank and distinction
such as collegiate fashionables
demand. Its red suede belt j
supplies a fetching dash of color. !
A pproval for the new' bustle-back
dresses is assured for being inter- |
preted in sim ple words, bustle-back !
is m erely a w ay o f saying “ back !
fullness” achieved in ingenious
ways that are conservative and ;
wearable without being overdone.
The suit to the right is very style- 1
revealing, stressing as it does the
continued triumph in the mode of j
richly colorful striped woolens. The
stripes, the plaids and the m arvelous
artistry with which designers ;
combine them with monotones in related
tone sim ply hold one spellbound.
The gorgeous striped wool
that fashions the costume suit keys
to the sm artest fall colors, harmonizing
vibrant greens with luscious
blackberry tones. The skirt is allaround
pleated. The boxy jacket
tops an em erald green ve lve t blouse
closing with novel key-and-keyhole
ornaments. An oversize quill tops
the moss green sailor hat.
You m ay expect to .see gay little
velvet jackets dotted all over the
college campus. The girl centered
in the picture w ears a snug black
velveteen jacket quite m ilitary looking
as so many of the newer fashions
are, with a plaid pleated skirt
that introduces an artful blend of
grape, pink and yellow tones, c limaxed
with a sw eater in w arm y ellow
hues. Juniors, likew ise college
sophisticates, sim ply dote on the
new plaids and stripes. A Scotch
cap of black velvet with satin ribbon
stream er, together with the
plaid carries the m essage that fashions
for young folks have gone very
Scotch this season.

For m any women, the most try ing
coat length o f recent inspiration
is the rather popular Just-below-
the-waist length that nips in at
| the m idriff and hugs the hips.
It is a good style for a slender
woman with a stream lined figure
1 and is being shown in any number
j o f varieties, of which one of the
■ most popular is a monotone wool
jacket worn over a gay print dress.
But the problem is not so simple
I for those who border on plumpness.
! One suggestion is that the slightly
swallow-tail version deals m ore
kindly with the heavy woman.

A m oney-saver for the bride consists
of a two-skirt suit o f ve ry sheer
wool or crepe, designed with a suave
fitted jacket. The street-length skirt
can be worn with the jacket and
printed crepe or organdy bloUses to
make a sm art runabout costume by
day.
A floor-length skirt of the same
m aterial, combined with the jacket
and a sheer chiffon blouse make a
chic dinner costume for boat and
hotel w ear in the evening.
By E M M A C i A K Y W A L L A C E
V V ^ H F .R E there is a fam ily of chil-
* * dren and the m eans are lim ited,
it often becom es necessary for
the older children to g ive as much
help as they possibly can, not only
with the housework but with the
ca re of the little ones, and the tasks
are usually accepted cheerfully.
But good judgm ent is needed in
such situations. The m other must
rem em b er that the older children
are still im m ature, and that they
should not be called upon for work
that is too difficult or too continuous.
What m ay seem light—not at
all overta xin g—to older persons m ay
be quite tirin g to a boy or girl, and
a child is entitled to a happy youth
as fa r as can be managed. Then
the little ones— even a single little
one— m ay becom e quite demanding
and tyrannical. The w ise mother
w ill keep a close watch o f the general
situation and see to it that each
child is dealt with fa irly.
In order that the m other herself
sail not be overtaxed and made
irritable by too many demands upon
her strength and time, it m ay be
necessary for her to sim p lify the
household program as fa r as possible.
P a rt of the ironing, for instance,
may properly be left undone. Many
garm ents and sheets do not actually
require ironing. I f they are sweet
and fresh and clean, pulled into
shape just before they are quite
dry and smoothly folded, that is all
that is necessary. The beds will
look better, o f course, if pillow cases
are ironed.
Even such ironing as m ay really
need to be done, can be accom plished
with less fatigue if there is
a high stool to sit on—preferably
with a hack—and one o f these costs
little. There is no reason why dishes
j cannot be washed, or part o f them
I ;>t least, while using the sam e stool.
If they are thoroughly rinsed and a
drainer is used most o f them w ill
j not need to be wiped.
M eals can be a ttractively served
and yet be sim ple and nourishing. A
i baked custard takes less tim e and
I work than a pie. Baked apples, simple
rice puddings, unfrosted cakes
| and “ one-dish m eals” each cuts
I tlown a little on the work, and evi
cry little helps. A “ one-dish m eal”
1 is one where vegetables and meat
i are cooked in one container and
j served in that container.
Don’t Let Work heroine Humdrum,
i Some sort of a play can be dej
vised so that the work the older children
do loses its humdrum charac-
! ter. F or exam ple: the livin g room
; is to be put in exceptionally nice
; order, because the Queen of Hearts
I is coming for supper, and as the
j children do the work, they could
chant to some well-known tune,
"T h e Quppn of Hearts
She made aomp la ri«
A ll on a summer day.
Thp King o j IIparts
U p found those tart*
And tto l• them all auay.**
One of the children could pretend
to be the Queen of Hearts who will
com e in with a bright red scarf
around her shoulders or a gilt paper
crown and inspect the dusting. The
King m ight w ea r that crown at suppertim
e when tarts m ay be served,
but of course he would not be given
a chance to defraud the others.
Taking ca re of the baby should
be carefully supervised. Slender
older children can wheel the baby
or draw him about on a little cart
or sled, but they should not be expected
to ca rry him. The little one,
who is being cared for by the older
children, should not be allowed *0
impose upon them by demanding
toys of which older brothers and sisters
are choice, and perhaps are
justified in not liking to lend if the
I baby is likely to break or spoil them.
It is not to be wondered at that
1 older children som etim es look upon
the little newcom ers as ve ry much
I of a trial. But under the right man-
| agem ent, with sym pathetic understanding,
they m ay easily be led to
love and w illin gly help care for the
j new babies. It should be made plain
j that they continue to hold, even
m ore securely than before, their
I own special places in the affection
and confidence of parents and rela

Fishing Licenses
Resident sportsmen will not have
their fishing license costs doubled next
year but they may have to pay $1
license fee if they fish with more than
one cane pole, or fifty cents if they
fish with hook and line.
The senate thought it was a good
idea to boost annual hunting licenses
from $1 to $2, with the increased revenue
to be used to establish public
hunting grounds, but the assembly
disagreed and killed the bill.
Both houses, however, approved and
sent to Governor Heil for his signature
or veto a bill which requires a $1
resident license fee for fishing with
two cane poles. A fisherman using
one can pole would not be required to
have a license.
Meanwhile the assembly advanced
to a third reading a bill which requires
a HO cent license for all men over 19
who fish with hook and line. The senate
has already passed the bill.
Present laws require a $1 license
only fo r resident fishermen who use a
rod and reel.
