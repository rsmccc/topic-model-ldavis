CO OP N E W S
By Earl Horswill
The Ohio Farm Bureau celebrated
its 20th anniversary this month This
farm organization was first organized
to aid county agents to increase
production of agricultural products 
 but at the close of the World War it
was found that an overproduction
prevailed so its efforts were diverted
to group buying in carload lots of
seeds feeds fertilizers machinery 
etc The grouping together of the
farmers in marketing their produce 
livestock etc were also undertaken 
From these activities their efforts
were again diverted to the establishing
of Co operatives and in this they
have been very successful Late in
1934 the Farm Bureau Co operative
Association Inc was organized replacing
the Ohio Farm Bureau Service
Company 
In October 1935 they purchased
a controlling interest in the Life Insurance
Co of America a legal reserve
company with approximately
$16 000 000 of life insurance in force
and assets totaling almost $1 900 000 
With the newly organized auto and
fire insurance companies their present
assets are more than $6 000 000 
Through its farm supplies of petroleum
products tires radio electrical
appliances paint machinery etc this
Ohio Farm Bureau Co operative Association
handled $6 856 000 worth
of business last year and purchased
their own eight story Co op building
in downtown Columbus which houses
the state headquarters serving county
wide Co ops in 81 counties of the
state Two new and modem fertilizer
plants of steel and concrete construction
were completed this year 
They are located so as to serve the
farmers of Ohio and neighboring
states to the best advantage and have
a combined capacity of 50 000 tons 
This organization has spent over
$1 000 000 on co operative education 
In 1935 there were 326 co operative
study clubs organized since then others
have been added making a total
of over 400 These study clubs found
that the average farm family spends
more money for household and personal
needs than it spends for farm
supplies and equipment and suggested
that steps be taken to supply these
needs so a mail order Co op was recently
organized and will be known
as Farm Bureau Co operative Services 
address 246 N High St Columbus 
Ohio They are starting with a
limited number of items such as women s
hosiery and men s working
clothes for which there is the greatest
demand and will add new items as the

Before 20 000 Ohio farmers gathered
at Columbus Ohio early in
November for the first annual Farm
Bureau Field Day Gov John W
Bricker praised the work of the Farm
Bureau Co operative and declared his
belief that in co operation lies the
answer to the economic and social
problems of America Speaking to
one of the largest crowds ever assem
bled in the Coliseum at the Ohio
State Fair grounds Grov Bricker
said This exhibits the ability and
eagerness of Ohio farm people to do
things through co operation I f ever
the economic and social problems of
America are solved if ever peace and
security and contentment are brought
to the world it will be done by the
people joining hands and working together
with the same aggressiveness 
fortitude and pioneering spirit as
characterizes you the farm people
of Ohio 
C O U N T Y A G E N T N O T E S
Cow Testing Association
At this time of year the majority
of farmers are making plans for the
winter feeding of cows which are
starting on the new lactation periods 
Most farmers are interested in testing
and keeping records of the butter
fat production and feed costs but
hesitate thinking that the costs are
excessive You may have your herd
tested once each month by a cow tester
who travels from farm to farm 
The tester takes milk samples tests
the samples makes feeding recommendations 
keeps records of each
cow tested and production and assists
with the keeping of farm accounts 
All these services are included in the
following monthly fees which are set
according to the number of cows in
the herd 
0 to 12 cows $2 25
12 to 24 cow s 2 50
25 to 30 cow s 2 75
10c additional for each cow in excess
of 30 
I f you are interested in testing get
in touch with Norman Hegna the
cow tester any member of the testing
association or the County Agent s
office 
D airy Rations
Livestock men who are thrifty buyers
can feed balanced rations and still
keep down costs by carefully comparing
feed values with their market
prices 
Pointing out that feed is the largest
single item of cost in production
either milk or meat Gus Bohstedt 
feeding authority at the Wisconsin
College of Agriculture believes that
if this feed or ration is made of the
cheapest feed possible just so long
as it supplies the necessary amount of
energy protein minerals and vitamins 
that farmers are proceeding
along sound business lines 
To keep feed costs down Bohstedt
believes that first of all farmers
should grow as much of their feed as
possible When feeds must be purchased 
he lists among the best feed
buys for their feeding value com 
hominy feed gluten feed and soybean
oil meal 
Corn whether shelled corn ground
corn or com cob meal he finds as
the cheapest feed grain crop Some
of the small grains particularly oats 
are out of line this season he said 
Among the protein concentrates he
lists gluten feed as the outstanding
feed bargain for there is a price differential
of eight or ten dollars a ton
in favor of gluten feed as compared
to gluten meal 
Among the high protein concentrates 
soybean oil meal is the feed to
consider for balancing a ration especially
if corn makes up the principal
part of the grain mixture Wheat
bran is out of line since it sells for as
much or more as does gluten feed although
gluten feed is actually worth
about a third more than wheat bran 
Because of the better quality of
hay cured this year Bohstedt sees no
need for spiking a grain mixture
with as much protein as last year 
He cautions however that it is necessary
to feed balanced rations if profits
are to be made and that proteins
make for a balanced ration Protein
is necessary in a ration and livestock
men should make certain that wherever
possible their cattle receive liberal
amounts of high quality pea
green alfalfa and other good legume
hay for supplying most of the protein
to balance the ration

To the sweet memory of our darling
Shirley who passed away Dec 
1 1937 
Tho suffering she breathed not a
murmur
For the Comforter stood by her side 
And whispered Fear not I am with
thee 
With me thou shalt ever abide 
On the river a pale boatsman hastened 
She heard the soft dip of his oar 
Then from earth and sorrow he bore
her
Across to that beautiful shore 
But nothing can ever take away
Her love our hearts hold dear 
Sweet memories linger every day 
Remembrance keeps her near 
Sadly missed by her mother father 
brothers and sisters

(From La Crosse Tribune)
Francis E White not only directs
the Hixton high school band he is
also a composer 
Entering his band in the Western
Wisconsin music festival at La Crosse
State Teachers College Saturday Mr 
White introduced his band through his
own composotion Hail Hamot a
march especially written for the dedication
ceremonies of Tomah high
school s new gymnasium at the request
of the school from which he
graduated in 1930 
Mr White began his composing
 way back in the grammar grades at
Seneca Wis 
 Every novel I read reminisced
Mr White had a song in it I can
still hear my fifth grade teacher
scolding me for writing my readinglesson
into music rather than doing
the actual assignment This habit 
however had a serious effect on my
academic work throughout my school
years he thoughtfully added 
Playing his way through Stevens
Point State Teachers college Mr 
White was solo trumpet star in college
bands But it wasn t long before
he organized his own orchestra 
which played a weekly program over
the local ether waves The swingsters
featured White s own compositions
and arrangements 
 When I m tired White explained 
 I compose my best music for piano
affords me my greatest relaxation 
His average turn out is four popular
tunes a week Walking Down the
Sidewalk a novelty schottische in
modern tempo and When You Love
Me In My Dreams are two of his
favorites now in contest competition 
The three best composers in Mr 
White s opinion are De Bussy Stravinsky
and George Gershwin And
when it comes to Paul Whitehal he
says 
 Paul Whiteman is the daddy of
all popular music and the dean of
all semi classical music 
Mr White likes working with high
school young people because they are
so interested in what they are doing 
As to building an appreciation for
good music in the hearts of young
people Mr White believes 
 The phonograph is the best medium
to use for instilling music appreciation
in children due to its repeating
advantage 
Mr White s latest composition is
 Cuban Carnival It is arranged for
bands and will be published next
spring Cuban Carnival in its spiritliness
is characteristic of Francis
White s one ambition to be able to
compose music that will bring classical
and modem music together

The late Judge H A Anderson of
Whitehall started a history of the
Trempealeau river and its tributaries
that promised to have been an un
usual addition to the history of that
region Although unfinished even the
beginning of it is of great interest to
those who knew him and those who
know the river and the country of
which he writes 
Judge Anderson sent the beginning
of the document to David Blencoe
who brought it to us The reason
he had never gone on with it was
because he lost his wallet containing
his notes in the matter The wallet
also contained $40 00 as well as the
valuable notes All will regret that
he did not continue the work

FOREWORD
Our River insignificant as it may
appear by comparison with some
other rivers is of infinite more im
portance to us than any of the socalled
great rivers of the world 
It is a pleasing feature of our land
scape and useful to us in countless
ways Some one may say It is
not noted for anything On its banks
are no ancient crumbling castles In
its bed are no hidden treasures of
gold or pearls No boats laden with
costly cargoes even ruffled its surface 
Its waters have never been
tinctured with blood from famous battlefields 
Compared even with the
Black and Chippewa rivers it is lack
ing in magnitude and historical epi
sodes Its epic if ever written would
be dull and uninteresting 
In substance the same can be said
of the very dearest things in life
Things that protect and nourish us 
Things that inspire us with ideals 
build up our courage and equip us for
life s biggest moments 
The gentle things of life the most
constant sources of our comfort and
happiness we take as matters of
course often without gratitude or appreciation 
But I love Our River For more
than sixty five years it has alternately
calmed and enlivened my moods 
given birth to sweet fancies impressed
my memory with innumerable images
of beauty and splendor For
these reasons and many others I
shall endeavor to pay it a tribute
which may be lacking in descriptive
artistry but I trust not lacking in
suggestive data which may prompt
others to ? better and fuller description 
I lack the talent and learning to
describe Our River adequately from
either a historical or scientific stand
point And were it not for the generous
assistance of my friends David
A Blencoe of Alma Center and
C J Van Tassel of Whitehall the
following sketch would be much less
complete than it is 
My highest aim is to awaken an interest
in the hearts of the people of
Trempealeau Valley which will stimulate
inquiry and appreciation due
our landscape features which are almost
unsurpassed in cozy charming
loveliness 
True patriotism begins with the
home and its environments and unfolds
in an ever widening circle till
it embraces our country to its farthest
boundaries 
In addition to the geographic and
physiographic description of Our River 
some historical facts and incidents
have been added to illustrate
how important a part it has had in
the history of our community 
PART I
Mr Blencoe says Our River is like
a tree with its top cut off He further
tells be that in some remote and
unremembered age it began its course
near where the village of Humbird is
now located Then came a glacial
period when the earth slept for thousands
of years in a great winding
sheet of ice Under the impulse of
a law affecting all glaciers this great
body of ice slowly crept southward
pushing before it great quantities of
earth and rocks In some places it
levelled hills and in other places it
left large moraines that changed the
course of streams and frequently left
lakes to remind us of its creative as
well as its devastating force When it
had finished its course it had left a
barrier which diverted the farthest
source of the Trempealeau river so
that its waters flowed into the valley
of the Black instead of Trempealeau
Valley 
At present our map makers call
Kersting Creek the beginning of Our
River This stream rises in the town
of Alma in what was once known as
Dutch Hollow south and east of Alma
Center Considering this as the
main stream The Trempealeau river
 and proceeding westward I will
give the names of all the leading tributaries
and their distances First
those that come in on the north side 
1 North Branch or Bovee Creek
7 miles
2 Fall Coulee Creek 4 4 miles
3 Smith Coulee Creek 2 4 10
miles
4 Curran Coulee Creek 4 miles
5 Jonas Coulee Creek 4 10 miles 
6 Vosse Coulee Creek 5 4 10
miles
These six all enter the Trempealeau
in Jackson county 
Proceeding westward thru Trempealeau
county on the same side of
the river we have 
1 The Turi Coulee Creek 1 6 10
miles
2 The Larkin Valley Creek 3 5 10
miles
3 Pigeon Creek (in Tremp Co ) 
9 miles
4 Maule Coulee Creek ZVi miles
5 Elk Creek 18 miles
6 Travis Valley Creek 6 miles
7 Wickham Valley Creek 4 
miles
8 Lewis Valley Creek 5 miles
9 Rainey Valley Creek 1 miles
From the south side we have the
following 
1 Van Gordon Creek 1 Vi miles
2 Tank Creek 4 miles
3 Holmes Creek 1 9 10 miles
4 Low Creek 3 4 10 miles
5 Pine Creek 5 4 10 miles
6 French Creek 6 miles
7 Skutley 4 3 10 miles
The seven last named empty into
the river in Jackson county 
The following empty in Trempealeau
County 
1 Trump Coulee Creek 5 4 10
miles
2 Tappen Coulee Creek 4 miles
3 Reynolds Coulee Creek 4 
miles
4 Lakes Coulee Creek 5 miles
5 Welch Coulee Creek 4 Vi miles
6 Erwin Creek 4 miles
7 Plum Creek 4 miles
8 North Creek 6 miles
9 Turton Creek 7 miles
10 Myers Valley Creek 4 miles
11 Trout Creek 3 miles
12 Latch Valley Creek 2 hi miles
13 Pine Creek miles
14 Tamarack 18 4 miles
The 36 tributaries named have
large number of tributaries Sixteen
have been counted in Jackson county
and in Trempealeau county their
number may be safely estimated to
exceed forty In addition there are
many constant water courses the
outlets of springs which we may call
rills Looking at a map of all these
streams such as Mr Blencoe has furnished
me of the upper part of Trempealeau
Valley Our River does indeed 
look like a tree with wide
spreading branches And we become
conscious of the fact that we live in
a well watered valley In closing this
part I will add that the total fall
of the Trempealeau river from the
head of Kersting Creek to its mouth 
is about 315 feet and its length is
approximately 75 miles 
PART II
Name of Streams
It is scarcely necessary to call at
tention to the fact that for nearly
every stream named there is a valley
or coulee bearing the same name as
the stream Whether the valley or
the stream was named first is about
as interesting as the old question con
cerning the hen and the egg 
It is further quite evident that
most valleys coulees and streams have
been named after pioneer settlers
and need no explanation There are
however a few names that form ex
ceptions to this rule For instance
we have two Pine Creeks that are trib
utaries to the Trempealeau The one
in Jackson county runs through a region
that used to be covered largely
with jack and hickory pine and for
that reason undoubtedly received the
name it now bears Pine Creek in
Trempealeau county was probably
named thus for the same reason although
there never was much pine
along its banks Such names as
Trout Creek Plum Creek North
Creek and Elk Creek are self explanatory 
The first stream west of Independence
has usually been called
 Traverse Creek This is wrong It
was named after Dr Travis one of
the first settlers in the valley where
the stream rises The name Trump 
designating a stream that enters the
Trempealeau from the south in the
town of Preston is also a misnomer 
One of the earliest settlers in that
town who came there in 1855 told
me that the coulee and creek derive
their names from the Van Tromp
brothers who came early into the
town of Preston In early days the
creek was probably called Van
Tromp Creek but for convenience
the Van was dropped 
The name Vosse Coulee needs
little explanation Nils Anderson
Evangerhougen came into this coulee
in 1855 He was unmarried and being
the first settler there he naturally
attracted the attention of settlers
in adjoining valleys He came from
Vos in Norway therefore other Norwegians
from other parts in Norway
began to call him Vosse Nils He
served in the Civil War This gave
him an additional distinction The
valley he lived in must have a name
and so it came about that it was named
after its first distinguished settler 
His first name was anglicized and became
 Nels 
Turi Coulee is named after Turi
Tytegrav the mother of Johannes and
Peter Tytegrav who came to Mound
Springs in 1854 together with about
eighteen other pioneers In this company 
I think there were five women
past fifty years who walked
from Racine Wisconsin Turi a widow 
being one of them These people
were probably the first actual settlers
in Trempealeau Valley Turi
Tytegrav deserves the distinction of
having a little coulee named after
her 
The upper end of Fall Coulee was
settled by a number of people who
came from Fol dalen in Norway 
Fol has been changed to Fall and
dalen has become Coulee So we
have Fall Coulee 
As we read over the names of our
streams and coulees and other features
of our landscape which bear the
names of our pioneer settlers we realize
how interesting it would be to
have the biographies of the men and
women who have left their names for
our daily use

Judge Edgar V Werner who has
been judge of the Tenth Circuit
Court nearly a quarter of a century 
will retire from his high office next
January Probably he will again engage
in the practice of law in his
home city of Appleton 
The Judge has had a long and distinguished
career on the bench and
during that career he has presided
over circuit courts m nearly every
county of the state He has been the
presiding jurist upon the trial of some
of the most important litigations He
is an indefatiguable worker and he
has ever given to the arduous duties
of his office his devoted attention He
has presided with fairness and impartiality
and wherever his duties have
called him he has won just recognition 
as a judge whose single purpose
was in rendering justice under the
laws made and provided Among attorneys
as well as litigants he has the
high esteem of all 
Judge Werner spent his boyhood
here and for a time was a student in
the office of the late Judge G M Perry 
From here he went to Shawano
as a young lawyer to engage in practice
and gain the early but lasting
success which has come to him He
has often returned here to visit his
brothers and his host of old time
friends Our people have been justly
proud of the eminence he has
achieved and the fine record he has
made He is still one of our own 
after the passing of the years For
many years he has made his home at
Appleton where he enjoys great popularity
with the people 
At the annual meeting of the county
board at Appleton last week the
members of that body evidenced their
high regard for Judge Werner and
gave testimony of their appreciation
of his fine record on the Circuit
bench by unanimously adopting the
following resolutions 
 Whereas the outstanding service
rendered by Circuit Judge Edgar Victor
Werner ruling his twenty four
years of service to the people of this
state and especially to this county
cannot go unrecognized and
 Whereas he has made an enviable
record as a fair and impartial judge
in the decisions he has rendered during
his tenure of office as Circuit
Judge of the Tenth Judicial Circuit 
and
 Whereas he has been an outstanding
worker in the cause of good citizenship
for many years and
 Whereas it is the opinion of this
body that the counties of the Tenth
Circuit and the State of Wisconsin 
which Judge Werner has served so
faithfully and well will suffer an irreparable
loss when he relinquishes
the duties of his office Now therefore 
be it
 Resolved that the Outagamie
County Board wish him the good
health and God speed that he has
earned and deserves for his welfare
and in his future endeavors and be
it further
 Resolved that a copy of this resolution
be presented to Judge Edgar
Victor Werner and that copies be
sent to the County Boards of Shawano
and Langlade counties by the
County Clerk

Now that the football season has
come to an end it has hasn t it? 
the time has arrived for discovery of
heroes in other lines Certainly the
lads who punt pass and scamper have
been honored adequately and it is
only just to pay some attention to
sportsmen who display their nobility
and valor in less spectacular fashion 
On this occasion there is presented
a young man named Rollin Chappie 
who is suggested as an excellent
candidate for the mythical posse that
might well be called the All American
Deer Hunters He is a high school
youth a resident of Hixton Wis 
which is away over there to the northwest
in Jackson county He is not
personally known to this department 
which is on intimate terms with only
one deer hunter that man MacQuarrie 
but he is vouched for by a gentleman
of high reputation and that is
good enough for me 
The spokesman for young Mr Chappie
is Francis E White director of
the Hixton high school band Mr 
White has written 
Dear Sir I believe you will print
this story about an exceptional deer
hunter 
Rollin Chappie is an all A student
in his high school class of juniors He
is also a typical sportsman angler 
duck gatherer and master of whatever
else you like to eat But ?wait 
The young man is a fine tenor saxophone
player so good in fact that
his band leader (ahem tis I) frequently
writes in special parts in
other men s scores just to keep him
interested As a result the sax man
often plays music borrowed from anything
from a piccolo extravaganza to
a brass horn solo in Mary Had a
Little Lamb 
You can imagine what a hole would
be left in the Hixton band if the saxophone
player should sprain his windpipe 
or something And now consider
my anguish when I discovered that
the deer season was opening on the
very day the band was scheduled for
a concert in La Crose 
Young Mr Chappie said he chose
to hunt and darned if I could blame
him but when it came to the final
band rehearsal before the concert I
made a remark or two Without mentioning
any names I got off something
about duty and true values in life 
And when the rehearsal was over 
the tenor saxophone soloist was plainly
depressed Between numbers he
had sat with his head in his hands
and now while the rest of the band
was gaily planning its trip he stood
around looking as mournful as a hunter
with no bullets But neither he
nor I said a word 
There was just time enough for me
to pack my car get a haircut and
hurry home for the supper I was
afraid wouldn t taste very good I was
thinking How in blazes can we
possibly get along without our bassbassoon 
woodwind section who deserts
us to go hunting? 
Neverthless I sat myself down at
the table There was a banging at
the kitchen door My wife answered
and I heard her saying What s
that you re not going deer hunting?
You re packing your sax and going to
La Crosse? 
I reached with a trembling hand 
for the mashed potatoes My ears
turned red and they ve been red ever
since Obviously I had greatly underestimated
the sense of true values 
possessed by modem youth 
Sincerely FRANCIS E W H IT E
So there you have it Rollin Chappie 
Hixton 41 for the All American
Team of Deer Hunters MacQuarrie
may be right after all Maybe there s
a lot of good in all of em

The production of dairy products
was considerably larger last year than
in the previous year both in Wisconsin
and for the nation as a whole according
to the crop reporting service
of the Wisconsin and United States
departments of agriculture Wisconsin
factories produced more butter and
cheese last year than in any other on
record and the output of condensery
products was larger than in 1937 but
did not reach the record production
of 1936 
The state s share of the nation s
cheese production last year was greater
than in 1937 Wisconsin produced
over 50 per cent of all the cheese
made in the nation last year nearly
27 per cent of the condensery products 
and nearly 11 per cent of the
butter made in the United States 
About 35 per cent of all the casein
made in the nation was produced in
the state according to the Crop Reporting
Service 
Figures for 1938 show that Wisconsin
produced nearly 189 million
pounds of creamery butter over 365
million pounds of cheese and over
895 million pounds of condensery products 
Dairy plants throughout the
United States reported a total production
last year of over 1 786 millions
pounds of creamery butter about 725
fnilHon pounds of cheese and over
3 370 million pounds of condensery
products 
Finaj production figures show that
the dairy plants in the nation produced
about 10 per cent more butter 
nearly 12 per cent more cheese and
10 percent more condensery products
in 1938 than in 1937 Wisconsin the
leading dairy state has also increased
its output sharply of butter cheese 
and condensery products during this
period

The steel industry is fairly booming 
with the output of the mills larger
than even in 1929 Over 80 000
steel workers have been put on since
July 1st and now the industry has
over 525 000 on the factory rolls 
Hourly wages have increased 26 per
cent since 1936 and now average
$30 50 per week The war orders are
fairly pouring in from abroad while
our own federal expenditures for the
navy and for shot shell guns and
other equipment have reached a
figure only excelled by those of
World war days The press agencies 
confident of the old adage that steel
is the barometer of business are
basing predictions upon it of a big
burst of prosperity An increase of
buying power of $70 000 000 by the
wage eamers is estimated 
Improved conditions in the steel industry
and that of the automobile
factories which are the largest users
of steel for peace time purposes are
bound to be reflectd in other lines 
The federal relief rolls are feeling the
effect and the CCC enrollment is lessening
as the young men find better
jobs in private employment The
Christmas trade in the larger centers
in particular is starting off on a big
scale Incidentally the savings deposited
in banks by so called Christmas
Clubs will amount to more than
$350 000 000 this season This is a
much larger amount than ever before 
and most of it will go into the
purchase of holiday presents Buying
power is much on the up and
even with the increased price of many
commodities the volume will be enlarged 
Federal expenditures for steel products
make our government the largest
purchaser by long odds In 1922 
when we were still believing that the
World war had ended wars and we
were about a sink a big part of our
navy costing more than a quarter
billion dollars the War department
spent only $13 425 000 for new guns
and other armament For 1939 it
had $158 386 124 available In 1925 
the Bureau of Ordnance of the Navy
department expended only $7 463 316
for armor guns and munitions In
1934 the fund rose to $22 105 000 
For 1939 it had $73 026 169 Aside
from war ships war planes fortifications
and motor vehicles the government
purchases of steel and its products
for 1939 come to more than
$230 000 000 An amount more than
double will be asked for 1940 
The demand from warring countries
and those preparing for war for
the products of the steel industry is
not a small item The total for
1938 exceeded four million long
tons Japan was our best foreign
customer of that year taking more
than one third the total for its war on
China In 1931 our steel trade with
Japan was only 98 000 tons Last
year it was 1 542 000 tons The present
year exports will go more largely
to Britain and France 
Another industry which is feeling
the war fever strongly is that of airplanes 
This is relatively an infant
industry but its expansion is becoming
so rapid that it may rival in automobile
concerns in value of output
in another year New factories alleged
to be subsidized with money
from Britain and France are already
in course of construction It is said
that one hundred millions in new
plants will be hurriedly built Our own
government orders for war planes for
which contracts have been awarded in
the past year will also cause a large
expansion of plants and facilities 
In 1929 our federal air corps had
less than $12 000 000 for new war
planes of every kind In 1938 the
appropriations were advanced to $34 
000 000 This year there is available
about $149 000 000 As air planes
are largely made of steel and aluminum
products our national expenditures
for steel for purely war purposes 
and including only the items
mentioned thus runs to more than
$380 000 000 Other steel working industries
as well as motor vehicle factories
and plane plants share in this
great sum Machine factories which
turn out the machinery for making
engines guns shells and almost every
form of war material are included in
the burst in speed and boom in business
and employment as the world
turns to war and war preparation 
While steel continues to be our
largest industrial enterprise and other
lines will be quick to feel the impetus
of its trade improvement there
are other factors of increased buying
power which are aiding in the business
revival The increased price
of dairy products for instance is
spreading buying power among two
million farmers The rise in prices
is not so great as in industrial lines 
neither is there a spectacular growth
in the totals the farmers receive But
so great is the industry in volume of
output as well as value of product
that the manufactured products of
milk have advanced one hundred millions
of dollars or more since early
summer With added costs of production 
such as those for feeds and fodders 
as well as increases in the prices
of other commodities which the farmer
buys the advance is not all gain 
Many other farm products are higher
in price on which the producers of the
crops have a larger share of the advance 
Could the prices of all farm
products again reach 1929 levels 
there would be a solution of the industrial
as well as the agricultural
problems What is happening to the
steel industry w uld happen to all
others even without war 
The railroads which have been in
the doldrums along with nearly everything
else now are turning to a surplus
instead of a deficit that of the
first half of the year amounting to
$95 millions During the last half
of the year their profits will exceed
$65 millions The improvement in
their situation has come without the
remedial legislation which has been
pressed upon congress the past several
years and which still is pending 
Some of the returning prosperity may
be due to the improvement of facilities
and to a minor extent to reduced
passenger rates

There is such a thing as religion
without real devotion Saul King of
Israel wanted God s blessing but he
did not want it in God s way We
know that we owe God the full devotion
of our hearts it is possible to
simply go through some formality and
ease the conscience Such activities
may salve the conscience t a t not
save it Let us put real devotion to
our worship in the closing days of
this year

Chris Larson of Taylor passed his
92nd birthday anniversary at his
home Monday of last week Most of
his children were with him for the
day and Rev and Mrs Bringle were
invited guests Many friends join in
wishing him happy returns of the
day Before his retirement from active
life Mr Larson was engaged in the
hardware garage and oil business 
which is now carried on by his sons 
Russell Willie and Myron Mr Larson
keeps in good health and is able
to attend to his duties around the
home We are sorry to learn that
Mrs Larson ten years younger than
her husband has not been so well
and has been confined to her bed
since last June 
Their children are Olaf of North
Dakota Carl of Canada George 
of Blair Willie Myron and Russell
of Taylor Mrs Glen Vessey of
Cameron Mrs C A Nolop of Merrillan 
Mrs Howard De Boe of
Whitehall and Mrs Sam Strande who
makes her home with her family at
the home of her parents 
A stranger in town from those sections
of the country in which there
are no deer hunting seasons might
have gained the impression had he
walked into any one of our several
restaurants that Jackson county folks
are early risers The hunting season
opened that morning and the hundreds
of hunters on their way to the
deer war were stopping in town for
breakfast There were also many of
our town hunters who rose early who
didn t wait for breakfast at home but
went down town for a snack to eat
with coffee for a chaser So the oldtime
land offices in the days of homesteading
had nothing over our cafes
as to a rushing business By day light
the hunters brigade had moved toward
the deer trails but other kept
coming throughout the day and if appetite
makes a good hunter the most
of them were among the best Black
River Falls has a lot of good places
to eat for strangers and home folks
alike and undoubtedly they have been
widely advertised by the hunter
throngs who have tested them out 
How many hunters passed through
here Saturday nobody knows They
didn t stop to register But all Friday
night the big caravan kept passing 
some to the East side and others
to the farther north The ammunition
factories certainly must have put in
a lot of overtime to provide the stuff
which makes bucks into venison 
Mrs Melvin S Halverson is arriving
today from Stoughton to spend
Thanksgiving at the home of her
daughter Mrs P B Mills Mr Halverson
will join them Thursday on
his return from a deer hunting trip
in the region of Solon Springs He
stopped to see Mr and Mrs Mills on
his way up last Thursday 
rine vessels which are laid up on account
of the war abroad is bothering
administration leaders and will be
equally bothersome to congress when
it meets Possibly 10 000 skilled seamen
are idle and land occupations
are hard to obtain for sailors But
the shipowners are making more noise
about their financial losses than are
the workmen Undoubtedly they will
want congress to provide the money
for dividends as usual even though
government loans and subsidies have
been one of the principal sources of
their dividends durine many years of
peace MERLIN HULL
B R FALLS VS AUGUSTA
A crack Black River Falls quintet
ran circles around Augusta High
school to the tune of 24 to 9 for its
first victory over them in seven years 
Black River has nine lettermen back
from last year and is expected to go
places this year 
The scoring was led by Tom Horswill
who made points followed by
Lowe with 5 
The game was a veritable football
game with much piling up on the
floor The first basket was made by
Horswill who was fouled in the act
of shooting and made one of the free
throws allowed him and Black River
took a 3 to 0 lead This was soon
passed by Augusta with two field
goals and a free throw This 5 to 3
lead was the only time Augusta was
ahead during the entire game They
were held scoreless for the second and
third quarters 
The second period featured two
free throws by Horswill and a basket
scored by Upton on a neat out of
bounds play The larger part of the
quarter was fast but scoreless playing 
The third quarter saw several buckets
scored for Black River One by
Horswill Northup Lowe and Upton 
Northup and Upton s shots were both
spectacular long shots These four
baskets plus a free throw by Northup
made the score 16 to 5 
Augusta opened the last quarter
by making two field goals to complete
her scoring and B R took up where
she left off A long swish shot was
made by Haralson and another by
Lowe Horswill gained possession of
the ball and dribbled the length of the
floor through opposing players to
nake a basket Just a second before
the game ended a free throw was alowed
Carisch and it was made the
score standing 24 to 9

is running 
Always have a car window open
while driving 
This gas is so deadly that the
amount produced in three minutes by
an ordinary car motor running in a
closed single car garage will prove
fatal to the occupants 
Be careful!

the queerest coincidence on
Sunday about 11 45 a m which they
will never forget They were hunting
deer back of the Ed O Thompson
place Carl had shot a buck and they
were dragging it out of the woods and
had stood their guns up against a
bush and were resting when they
heard some one walking behind them 
They looked to see who it was but it
was no one that Mr Anderson or Carl
knew A stranger and he had a boy
with him about 14 or 15 years old 
They talked to Carl and his father
for about 20 minutes Carl reached
for his gun and the stranger told him
to leave the gun alone but they
thought he was fooling but later they
found out he meant business He
pulled back the trigger of his gun and
pointed it at Carl and said Leave
that gun and get going Mr Anderson
asked what the idea was and
if they couldn t have their guns and
he said Get going As they started
Mr Anderson heard the boy say to
the man Now let them have it Mr 
Anderson and Carl went to Mrs 
Green s and called the undersheriff 
Mr Kasik When he arrived they
went to see if they could find the
deer They heard some one talking
but with no gun Mr Anderson didn t
wish to take any more chances so he
told the undersheriff he didn t want
to go and look for the deer as it
might be that this stranger had some
one watching the deer So the undersheriff 
Mr Anderson and Carl went
and got the deer out of the woods 
They saw no trace of the boy or the
man or the two guns Mr Anderson
and Carl said they could identify them
if they were to meet up with them
again Mr Anderson said they were
lucky this fellow didn t shoot

do Stanley showed us how the jig
should be done Last but certainlynot
least are Juanita Steele and Harold

a modem safe inside the sheriff
pointed out 
The Fairchild robbery was discovered
about 8 30 a m Sunday when
William Mueller a clerk at the store 
entered the building Entrance wai 
gained through a back door which
was forced The vault is an interior
brick structure about 8 by 10 feet in
size Some efforts were made to drill
through the brick but this was abandoned
and an explosive probably nitroglycerine 
was used to blast the
door open A similar explosive opened
the door of the safe 
The time of the burglary is set at
about 3 a m Sunday Sheriff Pepin
said after questioning townspople revealed
that Elmer Voll employee at
the Omaha railroad station there and
on duty at night heard an explosion
about that time Voll looked out of
the window of the station he told authorities 
but saw nothing to arouse
his suspicions The Farmers Store affiliated
with the Eau Claire store and
others in northern Wisconsin is about
one block from the railroad station 
In addition to the money which
was taken from the safe in the vault 
the yeggmen escaped with ten
watches and other items of jewelry 
property of Samuel Crane who operates
a jewelry store in the Farmers 
Store building and which had been
placed in the vault in a tray The
burglars also helped themselves to a
new 30 caliber Winchester rifle 
Opening of hunting season brought
many strangers to Fairchild Saturday
officials pointed out and the yeggs
could have mingled with the hunters 
possibly dresed as men on a deer trip 
without arousing attention The night
constable at Fairchild goes on duty
at midnight and no one has been
found by authorities able to give any
clue which might lead them to the
yeggmen Harold Hanson formerly of
Eau Claire is manager of the Fairchild
Store Eau Claire Leader

Theodore Quackenbush quietly observed
his 91st birthday anniversary
Saturday On Sunday the members
of his family will gather at his home
in honor of his birthday which has
been the occasion for an annual celebration
by the family for several
years On one of these occasions Mr 
Quackenbush sprung a surprise on the
group when he brought out a watermelon
which he had carefully preserved
in his basement for several months 
Mr Quackenbush was born Nov 
25 1848 in Factoryville N Y a
son of Joseph and Adeline Quacken
bush He came to this community
with his parents at the age of four
and a half years At that time he
says Melrose did not have paved
streets electric lights waterworks or
the other modern conveniences they
now enjoy There were only two or
three buildings on what is now Main
street one of which housed the post
office and a small store on the corner
where the Lutz store is now located 
The greater part of his younger
life was spent on the Quackenbush
farm in the Red School House val
ley now operated by Hugh Hemstock
After his marriage he farmed the
place for several years and raised his
family there In 1906 he purchased
a store in the village of Melrose
which he operated for 16 years before
retiring from business to make
his home here 
 Thede as he is well known to
every one here holds the distinction
of being the oldest man in Melrose 
He has always enjoyed unusually
good health A fall a few months ago
has confined him to his home but
previous to this time he was very active
and in the later years of his life
has enjoyed playing golf 
His mind is very alert and he is
well read and posted on the conditions
in the country today He has been
married four times three of his
wives having died His present wife
was formerly Mrs Mabel Simpson 
He has six children living and two
have passed away His children are
Mrs A M Hanson Ward Quackenbush 
and Mrs Maude Vogel of
West Salem Mrs A L Baumgartner
of Billings Mont Mrs Harley
Simpson of River Falls and Theo
dore Quackenbush Jr of Minneapo
lis He is the only living member of
a family of nine children La Crosse

To many Wisconsin people who will
receive a supply of Christmas Seals
in the mail this week along with a
request to buy and use as many as
possible the Seals will be a reminder
of a large red and white trailer in
which clinics are conducted to And
tuberculosis 
The Seals are going into the mails
throughout Wisconsin this week as
the 1939 Seal sale of the Wisconsin
Anti tuberculosis association and its
affiliated groups throughout the state
gets under way Funds raised in this
annual drive make possible a continuation
of the many services of health
education and case finding conducted
the year around 
A new W A T A service which
made its debut in February of this
year and has just completed nine
months of work is the Pfister Fund
Fluoroscope Unit a traveling fluoroscope
clinic complete in a trailer 
While the unit was equipped through
a special fund donated to the association
by the late Charles F Pfister 
Milwaukee the operation of this modern
diagnostic aid is financed with
Christmas Seals 
During the nine months that the
trailer has been in operation in Wisconsin 
it has visited 61 communities
in 23 counties and in it a total of
6 219 men women and children have
been examined Ninety eight suspiciously
active cases of tuberculosis
were uncovered 23 were recommended
for sanatorium care and a total
of 338 whose examinations
showed some indications of findings 
were directed to have further study 
including chest x rays 
The fluoroscope unit is one of many
services financed with Christmas Seal
funds

WASHINGTON Nov 28 Secre
tary of Agriculture Henry A Wallace
announced a 1940 farm program today
calling for more than $750 000 
000 in government subsidy payments 
The program provides for increased
payments for soil conservation practices
in line with Wallace s plan to
shift emphasis from acreage control
to soil conservation 
Wallace said that the 1940 program
was contingent upon an appropriation
of $500 000 000 to the agricultural
adjustment administration by congress 
At the last session $225 000 
000 was appropriated for parity payments 
Export subsidy payments will
add considerably to the farm total 
The program calls for changes in
the rates of payment on several crops
but total benefit payments would be
about the same as this year The national
soil depleting crop goal was
unchanged at 270 000 000 to 285 
000 000 acres 
Wheat acreage in 1940 would be
increased from 55 000 000 acres this
year to 62 000 000 acres The 1940
goal will be increased from nine to
10 cents a bushel An additional parity
payment of five or six cents a
bushel will be made AAA wheat payments
were reduced from 17 to nine
cents a pound 
Acreage goals in 1940 for other
crops were 
Potatoes unchanged at 3 100 000
 3 300 000 acres 
Flue cured tobacco 730 000 
770 000 acres compared with 860 000
 900 000 this year Benefit payment
rate increased from 8 cent to onecent
a pound 
Burley tobacco 360 000 370 000
acres compared with 375 000 410 000
this year Benefit rate raised from 8
cent to one cent a pound 
Fire and dark air cured tobacco 
155 000 165 000 acres compared with
160 000 170 000 this year Benefit
rate reduced from 1 26 cents to 1 2
cents a pound

Two traffic fatalities involving
horse drawn vehicles have been reported
in November the first in over 22
months the State Highway commission
rveals 
Even non fatal accidents involving
horse drawn vehicles are rare in Wisconsin
traffic reports 
One of the fatalities was in Kenosha
county a farmer being fatally
injured when his wagon was truck
from behind by an automobile The
other death was in Ashland county
where the driver of a farm tractor
was killed when his vehicle went into
the ditch as he attempted to pass
a load of hay 
Wagons trailers and farm implements
without lights or reflectors 
and automobiles with defective lights
are dangerous to drivers of all vehicles 
the commission declares 
Just as dangerous is the automobile
with only one headlight or with no
tail light the highway commission
states Arrival of cold weather always
increases the number of one eyed
cars on the highways and motorists
are urged to check their lighting systems
regularly to see that all equipment
is working safely

In fifteen years the farmers of
America have lifted the business of
raising turkeys from a barnyard sideline
into a great 70 million dollar industry 
according to Sam Guard commentator
on The Farmers Forum and
editor of Breeders Gazette This
year there is 22 per cent more turkey
meat for Thanksgiving and Christmas
than last year and the year s crop is
set at 31 957 000 birds 
Most persons know that turkeys
did not originate in Turkey Christopher
Columbus according to Mr 
Guard was the first white man who
ever saw a turkey The bird is as distinctly
American as the hills of New
England or the Rocky mountains of
Colorado Turkeys were the first livestock
exported from the United
States It is strange however to consider
that while the wild turkey was
a native American now all six of the
domesticated varieties of turkeys
grown in the United States are really
descendants of stock imported from
abroad The six breeds are the
Bronze Narragansett the White Holland 
the Bourbon Red the Black and
the Slate 
Mikhail Harefoot do you still act
toward your wife the same as you did
before you were married?
Harefoot Just the same I remember
when I first fell in love with
her I would lean over the fence in
front of her house and gaze at her
shadow on the curtain afraid to go
in And I act exactly the same way
now
