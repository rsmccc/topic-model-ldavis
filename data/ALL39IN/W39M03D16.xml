FORTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY. WISCONSIN. THURSDAY, MARCH lti, 19.19 NUMBER 18
Progressive Filibuster
Voting strictly on party lines, the
senate Friday morning advanced to
final passage the Budlong repeal bill
abolishing the LaFollette created Wisconsin
Development Authority by a
vote of 20 to 11. The senate is expected
to complete its action of concurrence
with the assembly bill this
week.
Advancing the repeal bill to final
passage, however, did not come until
after senators had spent a full night
in session. Beginning at 7:30 p. m.
Thursday evening, it was not until
7:45 a. m. Friday morning that the
vote was taken.
Progressives who have been forced
to ait by and witness the repeal of
much of the legislation which was enacted*
by the 1937 legislature and the
1937 special sc»ssion, engaged in a
futile 12-hour filibuster against the repeal
of the WDA. Although the long
delay on the vote did not garner them
a single additional vote, they did in a
measure gain a brief respite in that
after the all night vigil, the majority
party, Republican and Democrat coalition,
agreed not to place the bill on
final passage, and thus the W DA lives
another week.
Michael F. Kresky, Green Bay Progressive,
chief filibusterer, made legislative
history when he talked continuously
for five hours and eight minutes.
The only time Kresky stopped talking
was when he sipped a drink of water
or when Progressive colleagues interrupted
to ask questions, timed to give
Kresky’s voice a rest and to give him,
by way of questions, additional subject
matter to discuss. The Green Bay
senator’s feat was acclaimed by observers
to be all the more remarkable
because he never deviated from the
subject before the house. His voice
was just as strong at 6:00 a. m. Fri
day morning as it was when he began
five hours earlier.
Nelson Derides Governor
Interested spectator at the senate's
all night session was Governor Ju liu '
Heil and several members of his executive
staff. Noting the Governor*?
presence, and that he chatted with
senators in the corridors and senate
pallors, Senator Phil Nelson, Maple
Progressive, accused the ch:ef executive
of “Huey Long tactics.”
“ In all my 14 years as legislator I ’ve
never before witnessed the spectacle
of a governor coming right into the
legislative halls while important legislation
was being discussed. That’s the
way Huey Long used to operate in
Louisiana. The governor of our state
must be very much interested in the
repeal of the WDA which is doing so
much to promote electrification for
our farmers and cooperatives in Wisconsin.
That’s why he*s calling out
senators and telling them how to
vote,” Nelson shouted.
Ironically enough, while Nelson was
making his charges. Governor Julius
was talking to Progressive Senator
Rush of Neillsville. Reports have it
that the senator and governor were
exchanging farm experiences, as both
were once farm boys.
The governor left at 3:00 a. m. He
visited an evening session of the assembly
two weeks ago, and assemblymen
too wondered why he was there.
Those close to the governor, however,
point out that the governor is new in
politics, and has never before held any
political office, and that his visits to
the legislative chambers and hearing
rooms are made because of his interest
in his job as chief executive. None of
the senators with whom the governor
chattcd during the evening accused the
governor of trying to influence his
vote.
Short. Hectic Life
If, as is expected, the senate con
curs with the assembly this week, and J
thus writes an end to the life of thej
WDA, the Wisconsin Development
Authority will have completed a very
short but hectic career.
Designed to advise and assist muni- j
cipal power plants and rural cooperative
plants, the Wisconsin Development
Authority, a non-profit, semipublic
corporation received a  60,000
annual appropriation from the state
only after a long, hard fiorht in the;
1937 Progressive-controlled legislature.
The all night session of last week
recalls the walk out engaged in by 11
Democrats and Republicans, then the
minority, during the 1937 session
which gave the WDA its first lffe.
The coalition fled the chambers rather
than submit to a vote brought about
by what they called an application of
the gag rule in stopping debate on thc
measure. They returned to the cham- j
bers later and the measure was passed
over their protests.
Passage of the bill and Governor La
Follette’s signature did not mean all
that was hoped for WDA. Its first
vouchers for payment by the secretary
of state were contested and finally
ended in the supreme court where the
court declared it unconstitutional. At
a hearing by the state’s highest tribunal,
W DA found life again as the
court reversed its first decision, but
restricted most of the activity of the
department to rural electrification
work.
The second supreme court decision
camt during the middle of June, 1938,
and now, less than nine months later,
the W DA again faces death and this
time it appears most certain and final.
Arguments against the repeal of the
WDA in the senate were similar to
those heard by assemblymen when
they voted to repeal it weeks ago.
Those for the WDA claim that rural
electrification will suffer. Opponents
of WDA say that other states received
just as much rural electrification work

Robbers Flee After
Alarm Is Sounded
Two robbers who broke into Frenchy
Racine’ti tavern at Phlox early Monday
morning escaped amid a hail of bullets
after the Racine boys were awakened
by a home-made burglar alarm.
The burglars broke into a rear window
of the tavern. The home-made
alarm is so constructed that no one
can ente»r the tavern without tripping
it.
The three Racines, Bob, Dave and
“pewee,” jumped out of bed as soon
as the alarm soundest. They turneel
on the lights from the house which
floodeni the area around the tavern
with light. The burglars hastily came
out of the window they had broken
into. As they came out they were
ordered to stop by Bob but kept on
running.
Bob took two shots at them with a
.30-40 rifle and believed he struck one
of the men as he stumbled when Bob
shot. The men then jumped into a car
and speeded away as Dave fired two
shots at them with a .38 revolver.
Sheriff Frey was calle*d immediately
and although the Phlox area was
searched no trace of the men had been
found. - Antigo Journal.

In 1939 economic poverty can
throttle the most warlike nation, because
modern conflict needs m anpower
far less than gunpowder, airplanes
and battleships. Moreover,
foreign trade has become a vital
weapon of diplomacy. When Adolf
Hitler first reached power he could
import and use the raw materials
of war by capitalizing on his inheritance
from democratic government.
Commodities, a huge reserve
of unused capital, equipment and
unemployed labor helped build the
Third Reich's military machine.
Other millions went for costly public
works to impress the world with
Germany’s prowess. Meanwhile
heavy imports cut the Reich’s foreign
exchange to a reported 800,-
000,000 marks by January 1 this
D R . H JA LM A R SCHACHT
His jo b , now or n e ter.
year, while Germany’s moral stock
fell on the world market thanks to |
Jewish persecution and the Czech I
crisis. Barter trade (swapping) was
a desperate and unpopular recourse
to combat the more orthodox type of
agreement like America's reciprocal
program.
Among typical German signs-ofthe-
times:
(1) Twenty-nine per cent of the
national income goes to the state
via taxes; 10 per cent more reach
the Reich’s colters via social insurance
and enforced donations. Of the
basic 29 per cent, 25 goes for rearmament.
(2) Total tax revenue for this
fiscal year (excluding Austria and
Sudetenland) will be  8,880,000,000;
miscellaneous income,  80,000,000;
income via long and short term borrowing,
 4,800,000,000; the rough total
income,  14,000,000,000. Today's
public debt stands at between 21
and 24 billions, far larger in proportion
than the bemoaned U. S.
public debt.
(3) Minus cash, the Reich has paid
armament makers  400,000,000 in I.
O. U.’s since November 1 Bearing
no interest, half of them have gone
back to banks as collateral for loans.
Result: A completely artificial
credit structure which could collapse
overnight.
Chief worrier about this impossible
situation has been Dr. Rudolf
Brinkman, successor as Reichsbank
president to Dr. H ja lm ar Schacht.
On the job a few weeks, Dr. Brinkm
an worried himself into a nervous
breakdown. Meanwhile developments
reveal that Dr. Schacht was
not kicked out of the Reichsbank
into disfavor, but to tackle the job
Adolf Hitler had in mind when he
told the Reichstag Ja nu ary 30 that
Germany “ must export or die.” A
financial wizard who has more
friends abroad than any other influential
Nazi, Dr. Schacht is now in
charge of a campaign to revive foreign
trade by (1) seeking new m arkets
to provide additional foreign
exchange, and (2) thawing out frozen
debits and credits created under
the Nazi system.
The significance of this situation
is that France and Britain, now
weaker than Germany in m ilitary
might, will eventually be stronger
by virtue of superior financial reserves.
Without batting an eyelash,
London is spending more than
 3,000,000,000 for defense next year
and can continue at this pace for
several years to come. Germany
must get foreign exchange im m e d iately
or stop rearming, and Britain
is now waging an aggressive and
successful campaign to block the
Reich's trade expansion plans.
One very important reason why
observers predict a European showdown
this spring is that the Reich
must strike now—while her might is
still supreme—or suffer eventual
diplomatic defeat. Moreover this
economic supremacy of world democracies
will have the same efTect
on dictatorial Italy and Japan.
Congress
Most Americans do not realize
that the bulk of New Deal reform
measures have been adopted in one
form or another. But practically
everyone realizes the cost of reform
has been tremendous, that the
public debt now stands at  40,000,-
000,000, that the treasury has a current
deficit of  2,200,000,000. With reform
achieved. President Roosevelt
is willing to join conservatives in
two m utually desired ambitions, balancing
the budget and helping business
get back on its feet.
Chief arguments concern the
method. New Dealers, whose program
is voiced by Secretary of Commerce
Harry Hopkins, would remove
oppressive taxes and hope
that the resultant boom would swell
federal coffers, balancing the budget
without eliminating “ necessary”
activities. Most businessmen and
many congressmen would take an

R e lig io n
As Eugenio C ardinal Pacelii, Pope
Pius X I I was Vatican secretary of
state and an important mediator in
m any a European squabble. His
two most notable achievements
were (1) leadership in the World
war settlement attempt of Pope
Benedict XV and (2) consummation
of the concordat that brought peace
between the Vatican and Italy. His
most difficult job was negotiating a
treaty with Protestant Russia in
1929, a feat that won him the red
cap of cardinal when Pietro Gasp
arri retired in 1929.
When Pope Pius X I died last February
9, Secretary of State Pacelii
immediately became camerlengo,
interim chief of the Roman Catholic
church until the college of cardinals
could name a successor. Internationally
better known than any other
potential candidate, Cardinal Pacelli’s
name was immediately bandied
about as the most likely successor.
This, despite his confessed longing
to lead the contemplative life of a
monk, despite rumors that his selection
would be none too welcome
by totalitarian Germany and Italy.
If Cardinal Pacelii had never admitted
anti-dictator sentiments,
Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano’s
newspaper, II Telegrafo, lost
no time pointing out that a Pacelii
appointment would be unwelcome
in Rome. In Germany another
newspaper, Das Schwarze Korps,
chimed in. At the Vatican, German
Ambassador Carl-Ludwig Diego von
Bergen told the college that his nation
was “ assisting at the elaboration
of a new world,” and that “ the
papacy without doubt has an essential
role.”
Though conceivably unrelated to
these events, Cardinal Pacelli’s elevation
to the papacy might be in
direct retaliation against two governments
which saw fit to interfere
with church affairs. A further possibility
is that the Rome-Berlin axis
erred diplomatically to such an extent
that the college of cardinals
felt obliged to appoint an experienced
statesman who could deal
with Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini.
S p a in
The spectre of two simultaneous
Spanish civil wars is unique, but
not unexpected. Since Barcelona
fell and President Manuel Azana resigned
upon breaking with Premier
Ju a n Negrin, Loyalists have been
threatened by internal dissention.
On the defensive more than ever
before, conservatives sought desperately
to regain the Anglo-French favor
that was shifting to victorious
General Franco and his Insurgents,
meanwhile making sincere gestures
to end the war. Premier Negrin
I and the Communist element, fearing
the consequences of surrender,
promised a futile “ flght to the
I death" which would serve no pur*
J pose since a Franco victory was inevitable.
In the long-awaited ex-
! plosion conservative Loyalists seized
j the government, drove Negrin from
I power and paved the way for peace.

W A SH IN G T O N—Whatever else
may be said of Harry L. Hopkins’
“ appeasement” speech, ;ntended to
start the wheels of prosperity turning
again in this country and to
pave the way to his own nomination
and election next year, very little
poker strategy was shown. The
build-up was wrong. The tim ing
was calculated badly. And finally,
it became evident that Hopkins s im ply
does not have the golden radio
voice of his chief.
On this last point, one wonders if
Mr. Roosevelt is really doing his
best by this, his second
candidate to
succeed him in the
White House—whether
Hopkins, like
Robert H. Jackson,
j/ „ > 1 is not being “ given
% i a ru n” like a candi-
■ date at a presidential
convention. For
it would seem to the
most casual student
mmm of mike oratory that
Harry Hopkins the President must
have known that
Harry was not big tim e so far as
broadcasting is concerned, and that
he could be improved quite considerably
by a little training.
Most people, for instance, figure
that Herbert Hoover would like another
try for the White House brass
ring, but nevertheless he did advise
Thomas E. Dew’ey, just before
Dewey entered the New York gubernatorial
race, that his oratory sim ply
must be improved. And no one
should know better than Hoover,
who as secretary of commerce and
as President was one of the worst
ever known—until Alf M. Landon—
but who turned himself, in the opinion
of m any observers, into the best
orator the Republican party has by
the time he had been out of the
White House for four years.
Promised His Head Off;
Final Effort Became l)iid
Coming back to Hopkins’ strategy,
or lack of it, it is possible that he
could not avoid one big mistake.
Looking at the whole affair coldly,
it is probable that if Hopkins had
made that same speech three
months earlier it would have been a
wow. The whole country would
have talked of nothing else for
weeks. Business would have been
electrified. Everybody knowing
how close he was to the President,
it would have marked a dram atic
and spectacular milestone.
What had happened in that three
months to make it seem an anticlimax?
To have made it, frankly,
a disappointment to business as well
as to Hopkins’ boosters?
The answer is simple. There had
been too much build-up. The trouble
was that Hopkins meantime had
been nominated for secretary of
commerce, and had to get himself
confirmed. Not only that, he had
to go far enough in his campaign
to get confirmed to avoid any serious
fight over his confirmation. Anything
else might have thrown him
off what seemed like a clear track
leading to the White House before
he could get steam up.
So he promised his head off, not
in one interview but in dozens. He
had half a dozen “ spokesmen” on
the conservative side in the senate
telling their colleagues, and newspaper
men, and business men back
home, just how safe and sane H arry
was going to be. He was specific
in his pledges, left nothing to the
imagination.
In fact, he said so much, and it
was relayed so widely, that it is no
wonder his final public effort was a
dud.
Balancing the Budget Is
Seen Virtual Impossibility
The virtual impossibility of cutting
federal expenditures and balancing
the budget is clearly dem onstrated
in the recent senate vote
on the proposal to cut  4,262,000
from the TVA appropriation. It is
significant because this was the
most logical place for congress to
cut this particular bill if it were to
be cut at all.
The point is that the house, in
cutting more than four times that
amount from the TVA appropriation,
had included in the projects to
be discontinued the Gilbertsville
dam . on which the government has
already expended some millions of
dollars, and which in addition is
recognized by all engineers as im portant
not only to the navigation
and flood control of the Tennessee
river, but to the lower Ohio and
Mississippi rivers as well.
In short, it is easy to see that the
most determined m an to cut appropriations
in all congress m ight easily
have been swayed to vote for
the Gilbertsville d am money. On
this particular point there was no
roll call. It was approved by a
voice vote.
But on the four-million-dollar appropriation
there was no such argument
calculated to appeal to senators
who want the federal governm
ent to balance its budget. Yet
the vote to put the appropriation
into the bill—to go on spending—
was 49 to 31. As four additional
senators were paired in favor of
the appropriation, the total strength
for it was actually 53, four more
than a m ajo rity of the entire body.
Really Is Part and Parcel
O f O ld Pork-Barrel System
The really discouraging phase of
the whole m atter to those who see
the necessity of budget balancing
has nothing to do with the merits
of this particular appropriation. In
fact, it is not unfair to say that most
of the senators who voted for it
were not prim arily voting on its
merits at all. Some of them were
voting for the additional dam because
they believe in the government
going further into the electrical
business. Some of them did
so because they knew the White
House wanted it. Some of them
want to round out the TVA project.
For example, had A rthur E. Morgan
been a member of the senate
when this vote was taken, he would
of course have voted for the appropriation,
despite his bitter criticisms
of David E. Lilienthal, and,
inferentially, of President Roosevelt,
in the conduct of TVA affairs.
But the really discouraging point
is that it is part and parcel of the
old pork-barrel system. It will be
noted that the senators from many
of the states which hope for more
federal spending on dam s and river
control projects went along with
the m ajority.
What so many people who hope
for economy from congress do not
think about in their wishful talking
is that it is good business for politicians
to spend public moneys. In
fact, that is how politicians live.
Sometimes it is crude, as in the
case of local contracts, with attendant
graft. Sometimes it is more
difficult to trace, as in the porkbarrel
type of federal spending.
There the objective is not graft, but
“ bringing home the bacon.”
New Deal Feels Loss of
Keenans Political Wisdom
The stepping out of the New Deal
circle of Joseph B. Keenan, who
has been assistant attorney general,
leaves really no one on the inside,
so to speak, whose knowledge of
practical politics and political intelligence
commands very much re-
! spect on Capitol H ill, with the notable
exception, of course, of the
President himself.
It has frequently been a matter of
comment that Mr. Roosevelt, from
the day he yielded to Alfred E.
Sm ith’s urging that he run for governor
of New York in 1928, did not
make a single serious political mistake
until he had entered on his
second presidential term. It is also
! frequently pointed out that a great
; many positive actions, which were
of the highest order of political
sagacity, contributed to his success
in the period a little short of seven
years which is included in this span.
His first political mistake, according
to the consensus on Capitol H ill,
was his proposal for the enlargement
of the Supreme court, made
in Janu ary , 1937. Then followed
the purge, and a long list of actions
which approach the definition of an
old-time political leader that “ It
was worse than a crime, it was a
blunder.”
Many critics insist that it is not
merely a coincidence that during
the brilliant—always measuring by
the test of pure political judgment,
and not by whether the actions were
otherwise sound or unsound—period
Mr. Roosevelt had the advantage of
| the advice of loyal Louis McHenry
Howe, and that the period since,
when blunders have been frequent,
came after Howe's death.
Farley Definitely Excluded
From Political Councils
Be that as it may, the administration
is recognized as having definitely
excluded Jam e s A. Farley
from its political councils almost
ever since the 1936 election.
The President actively entered
three of the purge contests himself.
In one case, Maryland,
Farley is
known to have
hoped that Senator
Millard E. Tydings
would be defeated,
though his judgment
was that it could not
be done. In fact, he
is known to have
told close friends,
W ? A during the Mary-
■*'f land prim ary, to bet
on Tydings. In the
other two cases
where the President
personally spoke his wishes to the
voters. South Carolina and Georgia,
Farley not only thought the purge
could not succeed but did not agree
with it. In short he would have
opposed fighting Walter F. George
and Cotton Ed (E . D .) Smith even
if he had been sure he could beat
them.
Considering the whole picture
after Howe died, and when Farley’s
political judgment was being ignored,
Joe Keenan, who was the
ace politician of the New Deal, so
to speak, did not make a very favorable
record. But Keenan is not
blamed for this. He did not make
| the big decisions. He simply tried
to carry out the orders once they
had been given.
Farley is not apt to regain his
political leadership. The New Dealers
regard him as a candidate for
the presidency himself.

C am p depressed no one, nor did it
aeem to surprise his companions
there. They were, as Kale remarked,
a self-centered lot. However,
they immediately observed
the amazing change in young Kneeland.
Following Hale's advice, Bert
p»ssed Wednesday in bed—supposedly
nursing a cold, but in reality
enjoying nine hours of sleep. He
was dressed and downstairs in the
evening. He did not shake Hale’s
prestige as the Camp's social leader,
but he was certainly more norm
a l and companionable than he had
heen heretofore. Also his eyes had
• new look, which even the least
observant of them noted.
Hale went to New York again
Thursday. He had to report the
Craig affair to Kneeland. He also
wished to get his additional fingerprint
reports and to learn the results
of the analysis of the dregs in
his water glass. Concerning these,
if they were important, he wanted
a chat with Doctor Dewar. All these
little matters he attended to in the
afternoon. He received some surprises
in the process. He preceded
his evening report to Kneeland with
an invitation to dine with him at
the Engineers’ Club, where he gave
h im a carefully selected meal. The
attention and the food pleased his
employer. It was not until they
were back in the study of the town
house that the new secretary got
down to what Kneeland called
“ brass tacks.” He made his report
very seriously and in full, even repeating
all the conversations that
had taken place as accurately as
he could.
Kneeland’s reaction was about
what he had expected it to be. The
older m an had been first incredulous
and explosive, then amazed
and explosive, rent convinced and
appalled and at the end deeply affected,
and genuinely grateful to
Hale.
"A nd now, Uncle Cass,” Rex said
when Kneeland had finished thanking
him , “ we'U take up your case.
In my present mood of achievement
I feel equal to anything. It isn’t
quite fair t h i i I should have to dig
for my employer’* trouble as well
as for the remedy. You understand
the situation. Tell me what Ainaworth
has cn you. I think I can
handle him . You say it isn’t blackm
ail, but to me it looks Uke its twin
brother.”
Kneeland nodded again.
" I t ' i about that,” he said. “ I
■uppose I might as well spill it to
you. It's one of those things a man
U n’t exactly ashamed of, nor yet
proud of. It *—well, it s just auman.
I'll tell you the whole yarn,
since you found the other skeleton
in the closet. I ’ve got a good business
reputation. I made it and I ’ve
got it and I've always been proud
of it. Perhaps I ’ve bragged and
swaggered a little. I realize that
now, as I look back. I hadn't realized
it before. I give you my word
it never occurred to me that—well,
that I had a vulnerable spot like
Achilles or whatever his name was.
I'd have stood up anywhere and
asked anyone to look into m y record.
Yet I know now that that
pup Ainsworth could go into a court
of law and make me look like an
ingrate and perhaps like a thief.
Sooner or later he’ll do it, and I
m ay have to spend a small fortune
to defend myself. In the meantime,
I was fool enough to ask h im to
by the letter to keep it with some
others he had written her. All right
so fa r? ”
“ Absolutely. Guess I ’ll have you
argue the case when it comes
u p ,” Kneeland grinned. His deep
flush had faded and Hale was relieved
to see that he was becoming
relaxed and normal again. He went
on.
“ A few months after the patent
was taken out—in your own name,
of course—Morse died suddenly of
pneumonia. He was sick only four
days and doomed from the flrst.
You weren't allowed to see him
while he was sick, but you went to
his funeral. During his sickness
you had made sure that he lacked
nothing. He had just enough money
left to pay his doctor, but you paid
the funeral bill. Morse had left no

the C am p late last sum m er and
again this year. He behaved h im self
pretty well last year. I hoped
we could get on good terms, you
see, and come to a friendly agreement.
It hasn’t worked out. John
Phelps, my lawyer, tells me my cue
is to ignore him till he gets tired
baiting me and settles down to money
talk. Well, I ’m trying to do it.
But that young skunk is taking his
tim e .”
“ Suppose you tell me what he’s
got on you,” Hale suggested patiently.
“ Well—”
Kneeland had no liking for the
recital. His red face grew almost
purple as he proceeded with the
details. Hale leaned back, clasped
his hands behind his red head, and
listened to the monologue that followed.
It was long and halting. It
wandered off into side-paths of explanation
and reminiscence and
self-defense. At the end Rex nodded.
"Then it all boils down to thi*.”
he summed up. “ Soon after you
started in Chicago to manufacture
one of your early inventions you
met a m an named George Morse.
He was by way of being an inventor,
too, but his ideas were not
practical. He had patented dozens
of gadgets, none of them worth a
cent. He was likable though, and
you and hc became friends. He
talked his head off about his patents.
One of them and only one,
seemed to you to have possibilities.
You worked over it with him. It
wasn’t yet practical but you made
it so between you and the patent
was taken out in your name and
his. You didn't make much on it—
only a few hundred. It wasn’t anything
in itself. But it really held the
germ that finally led to the development
of your big success, the
Kneeland Safety Clutch. You
worked that out alone, but you told
Morse about it and showed him the
drawings. He was interested and
enthusiastic and made a helpful suggestion
or two. He was financially
down and out at the time. You paid
h im cash for his suggestions, not because
they were worth much but
because he was broke and you liked
him . You told him that if the clutch
was a big success you would give
h im a stake in it. You didn’t mention
any amount or make any written
promises. But he sat down that
night and wrote an exuberant letter
quoting your verbal promise to
his only relative, a widowed sister
with > small son, who lived back
East. He also said he had helped
to work up the clutch. In his excitement
and optim ism—he was the
Micawber type—he claimed to have
dmie more for it than he had done.
When he quoted your promise he
added that as he was a bachelor,
and had no notion of marrying, he
would be able to do a lot for his
sister when his ship came in. She
must have been used to his big talk,
for he was the sort that was always
seeing a fortune just around the
comer. But she needed monev bad-

except that it was somewhere in
New York state. You officiated as
his friend. You saw that his grave
was marked.
"T hat same year your Safety
Clutch began to catch on. Things
moved fast and you had to move
with them. You moved to New
York. You made a fortune with
your clutch. You never heard of
Morse again, and you hadn’t thought
of him for years till Frederick Ainsworth
walked into your office one
day last summer. He told you he
was Morse's nephew. He said his
mother, who had died when he was
still a boy, had been Morse’s only
relative. He said that in looking
over some papers in his old family
home on the Hudson, just before his
call on you, he had found Morse’s
letter to his mother, in a forgotten
drawer in her desk. He announced
himself as his uncle’s heir and
claimed h alf the accumulated earnings
of the Kneeland Safety Clutch.
That’s the whole story, isn’t it? ”
"J u s t about.”
“ Well, Uncle Cass,” Hale ended,
“ I ’m no lawyer. But surely you
see that the fellow hasn’t a legal
leg to stand on. His claim would be
thrown out of any court.”
Kneeland blinked.
“ Legally,” he said, “ he may not
have a case. But he could easily
make an impression on a sentimental
jury with his yarn, and there’s
many a business rival of mine who
would be glad to believe that I did
the Morses out of their just dues, j
And wouldn’t the newspapers love j
to play the thing up? Ainsworth’s
got quite a social position, you
know, even if he hasn’t a cent to
bless himself with. That gives him
some influence. What 1 dread most,
and what he’s threatening all the
time— is the loss of my business
reputation. Boy, it’s driving me
crazy !”
“ What would you pay him to close
up the case and clear out for good—
right now?”
“ He won’t do It.”
“ I think he will. Will you authorize
me to act for you, as you did in
the case of C ra ig ?”
“That worked out pretty well—as
far as I can see now.”
Hale grinned. Kneeland was already
on the way to the comfortable
theory he had predicted. That
was all right. Hale himself, and
Wallace Craig and, so far at least,
young Herbert Kneeland, knew what
the boy had escaped.
“ Will you leave the Ainsworth affair
in my hands?” he insisted. “ I ’m
getting to like this nosey, busybody
stuff. How much have you offered
h im ? ”
“ We never got down to figures.”
“ How much are you ready to give
him and m ay I act for you?”
“ Oh, all right. But I ’m not betting
on you this time. We’re dealing
with a dirty customer.”
“ Not as dirty as the customer wt
dealt with last night. How much
can I offer h im ? ’* Hale repeated.
Kneeland hesitated. “Twenty-five
thousand,” he suggested without
hope.
“ Twenty-five thousand a year?”
“ Heavens n o !” Kneeland fairly
yelped the words. “ Do you want to
ruin m e ? ’’ Then, discovering that
his young friend was grinning again,
he subsided, looking annoyed. Mrs.
Nash had been right. Casper Kneeland
was close. But no m an would
have felt generous in his situation.
“ Fifty thousand, maybe,” Kneeland
muttered, at last.
“ I don’t think he’d consider it.
You adm it that he can put a crimp
in your business reputation by
starting a suit and working up a
lot of undesirable publicity. I ’m going
to ask you a leading question.
How much is the Safety Clutch
bringing you every year in clear
profits?”
“ ’Bout a hundred thousand,”
Kneeland muttered.
“ A ll right. Why not give him a
year’s income and be rid of him?
I fancy he might take it.”
” 1 should think he would!”
“ What does Mr. Phelps advise?”
Rex asked.
“ Oh, he says we’d better pay up
and forget it. He ttrtnks I ’ll break
under the damned thing if it goes
on.”
Kneeland was still trying to digest
the unpalatable suggestion of a hundred
thousand.
“ Would he take it in stock?” he
asked at last.
“ I ’ll put that up to h im .”
“ It would bring him six thousand
a year. I ’ll guarantee that. Our
stock's on the Curb, and it’s way
above par. It wouldn’t be so bad if
you could put that through.”
“ I think I can. Anyway, I ’ll try.”

Mother Earth Still Better Timekeeper
Than the Beit Clocks, Astronomer Says
Notwithstanding that observations
snd calculations of astronomers
have proved that actually the moon
Is six seconds off its predicted
course, notes a writer in the New
York Times, Dr. H. Spencer Jones,
the astronomer royal, explains that
the earth is still a better timekeeper
than the best clocks He added:
“ However, we hope that a clock
we are experimenting with will
prove a better timekeeper even
than the e arth.”
In a report to the board of visitors
at Greenwich observatory, the astronomer
royal said:
“ It used to be assumed that the
rotation of the earth was absolutely
invariable, but of recent years it
has been found that the earth’s
timekeeping does vary.
“ To say that the moon itself is
off its course is to repeat a common
error—actually it is off its predicted
course. Deviations in the rotation
of the earth were previously suspected,
but not confirmed until recently.
“ The discovery was made by detailed
investigation of the motion of
the sun, Venus, Mercury and Mars.
In the case of these bodies it was
found that there was also a deviation,
though smaller in amount.
“ The moon being off its course
means that the earth’s time is
wrong because the cause of the
She was sufficiently impressed , moon altering its predicted position
is the slowing down of the rotation
of the earth.
“ This may be caused by tidal friction,
or a contributory factor might
be a land upheaval occurring somewhere
like the Siberian plateau, the
attraction of the sun or perturbation
by planets such as Mars and
Venus.
“ The earth is slowing down by
about 1,000th part of a second a
century. This means it is losing
tim e of about two hours every 2,000
years.
“ Eventually the days will become
much longer but this will not be for
thousands of years, probably until
after human life is extinct from the
earth .”

this m inim um , each member taking
personal responsibility for a definite

out of their pockets. Heretofore
all that has been required by

‘Pegleg’ Smith
p O R an example of chilled steel
I nerve, consider the case of Thomas
L. Smith. He and his partner,
J im Cockrell, were trapping in the
Green river country of Wyoming in
the 1820s when Smith fell over a
cliff and broke his leg. It was not
an ordinary fracture. The bone
was shattered and a piece of it protruded
through the flesh. Prompt
action was necessary to prevent
blood poisoning.
“ Guess we’ll have to cut 'er off,
J im , ” said Tom Smith, calmly.
Their only instruments were a
three-cornered file and their hunting
knives. Cockrell used the file to
make a saw of Sm ith’s knife. Then
Smith took his partner’s knife, cut
through the flesh, tied up the arteries,
sawed the bone, seared it
with a red-hot iron and sewed up
the stump.
When the wounded leg healed,
Smith made a wooden leg for himself
and thereafter he was known as
"P e g le g ” Smith. Before the accident
he had been a famous horseman.
Now there was all the more
reason for going mounted and the
wooden leg apparently made little
difference in his horsemanship.
At any rate he became the most
successful horse thief on a large
scale in the history of the West. He
spent most of his tim e organizing
expeditions into California to rob the
Spaniards. He and the famous Jim
Beckwourth made one foray into the
land of the dons that netted them
3.000 head of horses!
But when California came under
the Stars and Stripes it changed the
habits of “ Pegleg ” “ 1 won’t never
steal from my fellow-Americans” he
declared virtuously. Temperance,
however, was not among his newly
acquired virtues. He ended his j
days, a victim of strong drink, in
San Francisco in 1866.

A Perilous Journey
CAPT. RANDOLPH B. MARCY
halted with his party of 40 soldiers
and 25 mountain men at the
junction of the Uncompahgre and
Gunnison rivers on his way to Fort
Union, N. M., in 1857. “ Me no guide
you over San Ju an mountains in
winter tim e ,” declared the old Ute
Indian chief.
Capt Marcy had orders to Join the
forces of Col. Albert Sidney Johnston
near Salt Lake City with animals
and supplies. The orders said
to proceed without delay so there
was nothing for Captain Marcy to
do except proceed. In spite of the
Indian warning that none of the
men would get through Cochetopa
pass alive, the party left December
I I for Fort Massachusetts near the
present Fort Garland.
Four days later, when they
reached the mountains, winter’s
fiercest storms were raging. Snow
swirled and beat against their faces
It piled in deep drifts and hung
heavily on the legs of animals and
men. The cold became intense.
Captain Marcy’s detachment
pushed on, although anim als fell
dead in their tracks and men had to
abandon equipment. Before they
reached even the summit of the
pass their rations were exhausted
and they had to eat the flesh of the
mules as the animals died.
On Ja nu ary 12 couriers from a
relief party arrived and announced
that help was close at hand. Shortly
thereafter aid came So starved
were the men that Captain Marcy
issued strict warnings to eat spar
ingly.
His orders evidently were only
partly obeyed as one man died from
overeating—the only fatality in one
of the most trying adventures of
American history.

Teachers’ Tenure Survives
Wisconsin school teachers retained;
the tenure granted them by the 1937
legislature when the state assembly
voted 49 to 45 to kill a bill which,
would have repealed tht* law.
The tenure law provides that teach- j
ers who have served a five-year proba- j
tionary period cannot be fired except j
for incompetence and inefficiency, and)
can demand a public heal ing before j
the discharge is effective.
The bill repealing the law which the
assembly refused to engross was in troduced
by Glenn James, Republican.]
Defending his bill in the 3Mi hour de-j
bate preceding the vote on the bill. |
James cnarged that teachers were I
tired before their probationary period
ended to avoid keeping them on permanently.
and said “the present lav*
seems to defeat its own purpose.” De
fending the law. Paul Alfonsi, Progressive,
said that “ teachers’ tenure |
has given those in the profession thej
right to become spirited citizens, an
integral part of their community.”
There still remains, however, a bill
which exempts one-room school teachers
in rural districts from tenure. The
bill, authored by Herbert Schenk. Pro-j
gressive, had been previously killed,
but was revived and engrossed by the
assembly. Most of the opposition to
tenure has come from the rural school
districts.

St. Patrick
Although this well beloved personsonage
is the patron Saint of Ireland.
St. Patrick was born in Scotland or
possibly in England. His life seems
to readers of modern times most romantic
and adventurous. At the age
of 16 he was captured by pirates from
Ireland and carried to that island, j
where for six years he tended the
flocks of an Ulster chieftain. During
these years of his slavery, he became
a devoted Christian, and after his escape
to France, entered monastic life.
Directed by a vision to return as a
missionary to Ireland, he obeyed the
call in 432 and for the rest of his life
worked zealously in various parts of
the island. (St. Patrick’s return to
Ireland in 432 is considered “The First
Great Event” in the History of Ireland).
His labors were so miraculously
successful that he came to be known
as the one who “found Ireland all
heathen and left it all Christian.”
There he founded over 300 churches
and he personally baptized over 12.000
Naturally many legends grew up
about the name of this popular saint.
A favorite is the one which represents
him as charming the snakes of Ireland
by his music so they followed him to
the sea shores, where they were driven
into the water and drowned. Indeed,
much that is told about Saint Patrick
is little more than legendary. One
relic credited to him, a four-sided iron
bell, is in the Museum of Arts and
Sciences in Dublin.
What is accepted without question
is the date of his festival. All over
the world, wherevei the Irish have
penetrated, March 17 is celebrated as
St. Patrick’s feast day.
Always in connection with Ireland
we think of the shamrock, which is
the Irish national anthem. A familiar
poem says:
“ There’s a dear little plant that grows
in our isle—
State Aid for libraries is an annual |
fund appropriated by the state and j
used to supplement local funds to es-;
tablish public libraries in areas n ow !
without them and to extend and im prove
the service of existing libraries.
Why Wisconsin libraries need state j
aid:
30 per cent of the population of the
entire state is without local public library
service.
40 per cent of the population, ex- j
eluding Milwaukee county, has no local
library service.
A large proportion of the population
which now has access to libraries
is poorly served because the cost of j
adequate library service is more than
some communities can support.
 .44 a year is the average per capita
expenditure for library service in Wisconsin
from local appropriations. The I
minimum national standard is  1.
Wisconsin’s expenditure is more than ;
50 per cent below standard.
Libraries are of primary importance i
in all adult education programs and ;
provide the only free source of mater- |
il for those who continue to study af- j
ter leaving school.
Libraries are an integral part of
the educational system and arguments i
which support state aid for schools ,
are equally applicable for library aid. I
What state aid will do for Wiscon- j
sin libraries:
It will stimulate the establishment |
and growth of local libraries, thereby I
decreasing the percentage of people
lacking access to the free use of books. |
It will tend to equalize library support
in less prosperous areas without
decreasing support in communities
now served.

While your feet and fingers freeze?

And the air is fu ll of snow,

away one year ago, March 15.
Our precious mother from us has gone,
A voice we loved is stilled;
A place is vacant in our home,
Which never can be filled.
God in His wisdom has recalled
The gift His love has given,
And though the body slumbers here
Her soul is safe in Heaven.

“ F anged D e ath ”
H e l l o , e v e r y b o d y :
Distinguished Adventurer Graham Babcock of Paterson,
N. J., takes the Adventurers’ club rostrum today, and Graham
wins ten bucks because he wouldn’t take another fellow’s advice.
If he’d done what that fellow told him to he’d have had no story
to tell us today. But Graham paid no attention to that fellow,
and the result is one of the most thrilling, blood-curdling adventure
yarns I ’ve seen in a coon’s age.
It was in August, 1913. Graham was just seventeen years
old, lived in Suffern, N. Y., and spent his spare time hunting in
the Ramapo mountains, in season and out. At the time, hunting
was out of season, so Graham carried his rifle in a gun case and
took along a fishing basket, just in case he happened to meet up
with a game warden. Game wardens can put you in the jug
for hunting in August, but there’s no law against fishing for
minnies at that time of year.
G raham started out up the tracks of the Erie railroad and walked
as far as the R am apo crossing. F rom there he planned to cut into the
mountains, but the crossing tender, an old friend of his and an old-timer
in that section tried to dissuade him . "There's a rattlesnake den just
up the side of that gully,” he said, "a n d rattlers are mean at this time
of year. Better go in up the track a ways.”
Graham Unknowingly Walks Into Nest of Snakes.
But G raham had seen rattlers before and he wasn't afraid of them.
Whenever he’d come on them they had always wriggled out of sight
as fast as they could. He forgot, though, that a nest of rattlers in the
late summer season m ight actually be LO OK IN G for trouble.
G raham climbed up the side of the hill and walked along a ridge
until he came to a place where a big boulder jutted out over the edge
of a small cliff. There wasn’t a rattler in sight, and he began to think
he must have passed the nest the crossing tender had spoken of. He
saw some berry bushes a few yards away and set his gun and Ashing

IT’S an ill censor that blows
no picture some good. Warner
Brothers’ “ Yes, My Darling
Daughter” is the latest
picture to profit by censorship.
And anyone who saw the play
of the same name on which
the picture was based is likely
to suspect that the movie
moguls who were responsible for
the film rather hoped that a little
censorship, though a dangerous
thing, might result in plenty of free
publicity.
New Y o rk’s state censor board
obligingly banned the picture.
Whereupon the department of education’s
board of regents even more
obligingly lifted the ban, and the
public rushed to the theater where
the picture was finally shown, eager
to see what all the fuss was about.
In fact, so much interest was
stirred up in this darling daughter
that the theatrical producer who
produced the original play is said
to be considering reviving it.
Some of the women who read the
books of the “ Five Little Peppers’*
series when they were children will
be escorting their grandchildren to
see those young Peppers on the

REASON
The achool inspector was visiting
a class and. as was his habit, gave
a little talk on general subjects in
an endeavor to interest the children
in the everyday things of life. Or
this occasion, says London Tit-Blts
Magazine, he was talking about the
blacksmith and his trade
"A n d what kind ot arm muscles
has the blacksmith?” he asked
" B ig ones!” shouted the children.
"A n d why is the blacksmith's arm
bigger than mine, for instance?”
"H e works!" came the reply in
chorus.

A GREAT many people have the unfortunate habit of
warning friends and acquaintances against this or that
food, on the ground that it is "difficult to digest,” or "is
almost sure to cause digestive distress, especially if eaten at
the wrong time of day or in combination with the wrong
foods.” Indeed, to hear some men and women recount the

basket down on the boulder while he climbed up to pick a few berries.
But G raham never picked so much as a single berry. The minute he
reached for them, things began to happen.
As he stooped down to part the leaves of the first bush, a
rattler shot out from beneath it and landed almost at his feet.
G raham leaped back. As he did, the skirring ruffle of another
rattler sounded from a niche in the rock just over his bead.
Then, all at onee, that sound was repeated from a doien directions.
From the right. From the left. From behind h im ! Tbe
sound swelled Into a low, ominous hum.
G raham realized, then, that he was right in the middle of that
nest of vipers. He took a quick step forward—and stopped dead
in his tracks. " A big one lay right in my p ath,” he says,
“ coiled and ready to strike, its whole body swelling and deflating
with anger, as if It were being blown up by a bellows. Its tail
sounded its threatening war-note and its head was flattened and
drawn back for the kill. I tried to back up, and right behind me
near a rotted tree trunk another one reared its head and rattled
and hissed.
“ Talk about things flashing through your m ind! In a split second
I remembered everything I had ever heard about rattlers. I remembered
m y grandfather telling that this was the worst time of year to be bitten,
for in late August when the rattler is about to seek his winter quarters
his venom is twice as poisonous as it is at other times. And I remembered
hearing that the speed with which the venom takes effect depends
on where you are bitten. My uncle once told me of a woman bitten in
the breast who lived just 17 minutes.”
Those thoughts went through G ra h am ’s mind in just the smallest
fraction of a second, and they stirred him into action. Over his head
was a tree limb. He leaped for it, caught it, and swung out from between
the snakes that had him cornered. He landed in an open space,
grabbed up a stick and began flailing the bushes to right and left. " I
made for the boulder where I had left my gun and fishing basket.”
he says, “ still beating frantically with my stick. Another snake struck
at the stick, and I threw it away as hard as I could and tore through
the bushes like a m adm a n .”
Suddenly He Heard Another Low-Pitched,'Ominous Hum.
G raham reached the boulder where he had left his gun, out
of breath and shaking like a leaf. He had hurt his knee in his
mad scramble through the brush and now, believing himself out
of danger he sat down to look it over. And then, suddenly, he
heard another low-pitched, ominous buzz.
Says he: “ I looked back over my shoulder just in tim e to see
another big rattler leap at me. How I ever did it I'll never know, but
from a sitting position, without getting to my feet, I actually jumped
three feet to one side, and the snake missed me by a foot. It knocked
over the basket and landed coiled right on my gun case. I ran to the
left edge of the boulder and broke a lim b from a green sapling as if
it were a pipe-stem. I saw the infuriated snake make ready for another
strike and I knew it wouldn’t miss this time.
"B ehind me was the cliff. In front of me was the snake, and
I couldn't get off the boulder without getting In range of its strike.
Then 1 saw two other rattlers edging up to Join in the attack,
and although it was a terrible jum p I preferred the cliff to death
by snake-bite. I hesitated only an instant, hoped for the best,
and leaped into space.”
The top of a cedar tree broke G ra h am ’s fall. He landed in a bed
of pine needles below it and he says he fairly bounced as he landed.
"L u ck was with m e ," he says, "a n d the only injuries I suffered wero
the terrible scratches on m y body, arms and face. I went home leaving
my gun and basket right where they were, and I d idn’t go back
for them until after cold weather set in and the snakes were all holed
up in their winter quarters.”

A Touchy Animal
A hardup sportsman bought a
hunter and put off payments for a
time. Later he met the man who
had sold him the horse.
“ I am not satisfied with that anim
a l,’’ he said.
“ Why, what’s the trouble?” asked
the dealer.
“ Well, it won’t hold its head up,”
said the sportsman.

left alone, is to wonder how
they manage to find anything
to eat at all, in view of the
many good foods they consider
taboo!
Certainly there is no objection to
food as the topic of conversation.
It is so basic to
good health that it
should be uppermost
in the mind
of every individual
who desires to promote
physical and
mental efficiency.
And it is also natural
for a person to
be guided by past
experience in determining
what he
should eat
what it may be advisable for him
to avoid.
But it is a grave mistake for
one person to warn another
against any food or combination
of foods on the ground that it will
cause digestive distress. For the
truth of the matter is that under
proper conditions, a normal,
healthy person should have no d ifficulty
in digesting almost any
food that has a place in the wellbalanced
diet.
circumstances under which it was
eaten.
Perhaps a clearer understanding
of some of the mental and
physiological factors influencing
digestion would dispel many of
the bugaboos that cause people to
avoid various, wholesome foods
and food combinations, and to
warn others against them.
food is flavorful and well cooked,
the chances are that it will be digested
satisfactorily by all normal
individuals.
Be Tranquil at Mealtimes
In view of the fact that tranquillity
of mind is essential to the
proper utilisation of food, homemakers
should remember never
to discuss unpleasant subjects at
meal times. Don’t nag the children
about eating, or choose that
time to discuss their lapses from
discipline. Don’t talk about
finances or take up real or fancied
grievances with your husband. Let
such matters wait until the meal
has been digested.
If these suggestions were more
generally followed, it is almost
certain that we would hear much
less conversation about foods that
cause distress, much more wholesome
talk about the pleasures of
the table.

small horse, only 14 hands high
and weighing 950 pounds; dark bay

tail. The latter were coarse and
heavy but not thick. His head was
good but not very sm all—the forehead
broad, with small ears set far

dark, and prominent, with a pleasant
but spirited expression. His
back and legs were his most noticeable

“ Yes, Betty.”
“ And if 1 don’t get married, will

“ Yes. child.”
Deep thought for a minute.
“ Well, I sure am in a fix.”
Food Dislikes Often Unfounded
1 once met a woman who told
me that her contented-looking husband
could, and did, eat most everything
'cept horseshoes. Menu
planning was simple for her! And
how different from the problems
of the home-maker who m ust try
to reconcile her menus, both with
the food dislikes of various m em bers
of the fam ily , and with the
foods that they declare they can’t
eat, for fear of digestive distress.
It is true, of course, that individuals
differ greatly, and occasionally
a food that can and should
be eaten regularly by most people,
will cause distress in an individual
case. But that is no indication
that the food will have
the same effect on another peraon,
and it is misleading either to
proffer or accept advice of this nature
from friends.
It may be that the victim has
an allergy to the food in question
—that he reacts to it differently
than the majority of people. But
there is also the possibility that
the prejudice exists because of
•ome previous distress, caused,
not by the food itself, but by the
Emotions Influence Digestion
Scientists have established that
the stomaqji is capable of reacting
to almost every emotion and sensation
that is experienced by men
and women. Thus, how you eat
becomes quite as important as
what you eat. And any food or
combination of foods consumed
when you are tired, worried or
and angry, may cause acute distress,
u,rv' whereas thc same food, when eaten
at another time, may be d igested
without the slightest disturbance.
This indicates the folly of jum p ing
to the conclusion that you
can’t eat this or that, and shows
that one is scarcely justified in
warning friends or relatives to
avoid certain articles of diet.
There is a large amount of evidence
that fear, anger or anxiety
have the effect of diminishing the
gastric secretions, and further, of
arresting or slowing down the
movement of the intestines.
If food is eaten under these conditions,
it may remain stagnant
in the alimentary canal, with the
subsequent formation of gases and
decomposition products. But instead
of recognizing the true cause
of the trouble, many people erroneously
blame the food itself!
Medical men have frequently
noticed that people often develop
gastric disturbances when they
suffer financial reverses, and continue
to suffer from them until
their financial condition improves
—a striking demonstration of the
importance of banishing fear and
worry!
Questions Answered
Mrs. G . M. B.—Perhaps the
most important single improvement
that could be made in our
dietaries would be to include more
calcium-rich foods. So many of
our staple foods are poor in calcium
that a diet may be abundant
and varied, and still lack this bone
and tooth-building substance. In
general, milk is the best source
of calcium and should be the cornerstone
of the diet. Fruits, vegetables
and eggs also help to increase
the supply of this mineral
which has such a far-reaching effect
upon health.
Mrs. J. II. L .—It is a fallacy to
believe that hot foods supply much
more heat to the body than chilled
foods. In cold weather, we m ay
prefer hot foods because they give
an immediate sensation of
warmth. But the temperature at
which food is eaten has little bearing
upon the heat or energy value
it contributes to the body. The
most “ heating” foods are those
that contribute the most caloric
value. F a t takes the lead in this
respect, because it is the most
concentrated form of body fuel.

Never Eat When Tired
Almost any food may cause distress
when one is suffering from
fatigue. So it is unwise to sit down
to a large meal when exhausted
from too much physical or mental
work. A brief rest before eating
will put the body in much better
shape to receive and assimilate
the food.

pleasant surroundings, and if the

Isn’t It Time You Had a
JOHN D EERE TRACTOR?
I t ’s not a long step from horse-farming
to power-farming with the John
Deere. Farm boys hardly old enough
to drive three horses operate this
tractor. And it doesn’t require a mechanic to Veep
it in good running order. You can do it yourself,
right out on your farm.
The John Deere gives you everything you want
in a tractor for your heavy farm jo b*— adaptability,
power, economy, light weight, simplicity, and accessibility.
It supplies drawbar, belt, and power takeoff
service to reduce your iabor costs, to do your
work when it should be done, to give you more time
for other duties or for recreation.
Investigate the John Deere fully. Ask any one
you know who owns one. Come in and let us show
you why the new model is better than ever.
