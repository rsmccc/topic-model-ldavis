The senate committee has voted
not to recommend passage of bill 175 
the Public H unting and Fishing
Grounds Bill sponsored by the executive
council of the State conservation
congress This is bad news 
This bill provides that the price of
resident hunting licenses shall be increased
from $ 1 00 to $2 00 the extra
dollar to be used for the acquisition
or lease of suitable lands to be
used for public hunting and fishing
grounds It was agreed that most of
these public hunting grounds would
be acquired in the southerly part of
the state where hunters are many
but good hunting grounds are few
and it was further understood that
the areas would be mostly pheasant
shooting areas 
The chief opposition to this bil 
has come out of the northern part
o f the state where little i f any of
the money would be spent while people
of the north would have to help
p y for hunting grounds farther
south Maybe this is a narrow attitude
for them to take but nevertheless 
bill 175 is having hard sledding 
One must admit however that the
pheasant hunter is already getting
more than his money s worth when
one considers that every pheasant
hatched reared and released has cost
65 cents or more All a man has to
do is bag two pheasants and he has
more than accounted for the cost of
his hunting license after that every
additional bird he gets is being paid
for by other hunters It does seem
unfair that hunters at large should
be asked to further finance the sport
o f the pheasant hunter 
There is no question however 
that public hunting and fishing
grounds are extremely necessary and
they should be acquired with little
delay Every year that goes by we
see more and more No Trespass 
signs and the choice hunting grounds
become harder to acquire There
must be something that can be done
so that pheasant hunters may be assured
of future pheasant hunting and
that something should be done during
this session of the legislature 
I still think that 17-S is a good bill
but if it cannot pass then no time
should be lost in substituting another 
I would suggest a special license
for hunters of pheasants and
other exotic species costing two or
three dollars 75 to be used for
public hunting grounds and 25 for
hatching rearing and winter feeding
of game birds Landowners
themselves should not be required to
have this license while hunting on
their own lands Such a bill should
receive little oppisition in the legislature
and it woul daccomplish the
desired purposes

We have the following letter from
Dewayne Dutcher of Warrens which
will be found interesting 
Warrens Wis April 6 1939
To Whom It May Concern 
Some time ago I had an open letter
published in the Banner-Journal
in answer to an article written by L 
H Kingston pertaining to fire lanes
and the removal of gates therefrom 
Since that time I have learned more
 bout fire lanes and gates and find
that I am in error as to how many
fire lanes have been built on what
had once been public highways It
seems that I had been misinformed in
this matter to such an extent that I
made the statement that h alf the fire
lanes in Jackson county had been
built on what had once been public
highways I find that the conservation
department did not put gates on
any fire lane or highway without first
consulting the town board in which
these roads were situated Therefore
I feel that in all fairness to the conservation
department this statement
should be recalled and I want to
apologize to the conservation department
for having made this statement
without first consulting it as to the
truth o f it 
I would also like to suggest to the
general public that whenever they are
in doubt as to some question concerning
conservation that they stop in at
the ranger station and ask some of
the boys around there to explain
things to them They will gladly tell
you what you want to know and I
am sure we would all understand
much more just what the conservation
department is doing for us i f we
would talk it over with them once in
a while 
I am respectfully vours

The sad news of E rma s sudden
death cast a shadow over the whole
community for all of her short happy

was touched with sympathy for the
stricken ones from whose fireside the
light had fled 
When we see a precious blossom
That we tended with such care 
Rudely taken from our bosom 
How our aching hearts despair!
Round its little grave we linger 
Till the setting sun is low 
Feeling all our hopes have perished

We shall sleep but not forever 
There will be a glorious d aw n 
We shall meet to part no never 
On the resurrection morn!

appreciated 
The first and last directory was
published in 1916 and covered the
classes from 1S76 to that date There
are some names included during that
time on which information is wished 
Anybody who can tell anything about
the present whereabouts and address
may send it to any of the above committee
and it will be more than appreciated 
Time is short and prompt action
in the matter is essential The committee
will be grateful to any reader
of the Banner-Journal who can help
them out

We the white populace o f Komen
sky did not try to deprive the Winnebagoes
of the right to vote as a
challenged vote is not a deprived
vote 
The Winnebago leaders have nothing
to crow about as their force
was gathered not only from the town
of Komensky but Albion Brockway
and even Clark county Their victory
is similar to the victory of H itler
over the Czecho-Slovak Republic 
Mr Red Cloud was right when he
said this was the first time the Winnebagoes
stood together but he omitted
to tell us that the stand was secured
by the promises of the benefits
they would receive if they vote for
their leaders 
We deny that all the white populace
of Komensky were on relief I f
Mr Red Cloud would have had to live
on the relief that all the white people
of Komensky received during the past
seven years his meals would have
been slim and far between 
They want equal rights as the
white man has when it comes to voting 
holding office and other benefits
the white man has but they do not
want our responsibilities such as paying
property taxes financing their
own schools etc The county s expense
for Indians only in 1938 was
over $50 000 besides the federal government
aid for their schools etc 
The expense o f a white child s school
education per year is about $80 00 
The expense of an Indian child is
about $125 00 per year 
Yes we say when Indians get to
be self supporting in all like the
white man then we are willing to
grant him the same rights 
By a Resident of Komensky
H EA P TEPEE TALK
By Smoke Signal Red Cloud
Counting up to ten my dear readers 
is going to be easy Just pronounce
the words as they are written
and you will be counting in W in nebago
language as fluently as I can
speak it 
He-zhaw-key-la that s one Nube 
that s two da-nee three jobe four 
saw-chaw fiv e ha-kay-way six 
shaw-go-wee seven Ha-loo-wunk 
eight He-zhaw-key-chush-koo-nee 
n in e Kay-lay-paw-nye-zhaw ten 
A fte r you have learned to pronounce
the words count by Winnebago words
alone I t ll be easy 
Sorry boys there are some typographical
errors in the Boy Scout
oath and which was all my fault due
to my wretched writing so just disregard
it for the time being and I ll
rewrite it and this time you ll have it
down pat and no mistake I f your
tongue gets tired in the middle of the
oath give it a rest and then go on 
Feeling ran high for a few days
prior and after the spring election
in some localities particularly in our
township of Komensky and I must
say Easter Sunday came just in time 
Friendly and neighborly feeling have
come back into their own again and
all is quiet and calm and any one
with thoughts to the contrary is
caused only by prejudice and self-interest 
The feeling of Christian-like
good fellowship for all mankind has
even found its way into the wigwam 
humble tho the dwelling may be I f
we could all come to the realization 
and impress on our children the necessity
of seeking the Savior in the
early hours o f the Sabbath day of
life that Christianity binds all races
into one brotherhood peace on earth
and good will to all men would become
a reality We would find the
angels Faith and Hope have rolled
aside the stone slab o f ignorance and
show us that the tomb o f unbelief
cannot imprison the life everlasting
and Christ s own promise of resurrection
after mortal death Religion
may be likened to a stalwart tree
with roots running deep into the fertile
soil of the superior intelligence
that seems to permeate the universe 
For it to thrive it must send out many
many branches of denominations and
creeds that it may reach out and
draw unto itself the many types o f
sons o f men The matured tree as
God wants it to be would be symmetrical 
beautiful and strong enough
to withstand the ravages of time 
Next month Hawkin Halverson 
who has been foreman of the Indian
crew since the advent of the Resettlement
Administration into Jackson
county will leave the organization to
take over his new duties o f City Marshal
to which he was elected with
overwhelming majority in the recent
spring election The Indians composing
this crew are wondering who will
next take over the foremanship The
team o f Halverson and Redcloud will
have been broken foreman and timekeeper
respectively after nearly four
r ears of enviable teamwork It can
De truly said that if Hawkin Halverson
performs his duties as well as he
acquitted himself working for the U 
S Government the people o f Black
River Falls will have a marshal of
whom they can be justly proud and
who will substantiate their good jud gment
by unswerving loyalty to duty 
Fred Kingswan the full-blooded
Winnebago chief newly elected as
member of side board of the town of
Komensky was sworn into office last
Saturday morning and officially presided
as one o f the town officers 
Chas Marek took the oath of office
as chairman of the town and officially
took over the duties as such 
The people opposing the election of
Mr Marek accused him o f making
many alluring promises to the redmen
to get their vote Inreality Charley
never spoke to the Indians prior
to the election not even to the writer
who is a near neighbor and was to
some extent responsible to swinging
the Indian vote in that direction We
took Charley fo r a man who was
broadminded enough to be democratic
and I feel certain the Indians will not
be disappointed

games played were by Bob Heath and
Kennie Kolbrak Bob won those 
Kennie had bad luck at first but

although Heath held the lead Bob
Mathews won over Jim Larson Bob

The Neutrality law will soon expire
by limitation unless action by
congress shall continue it by resolution
or supercede it with a new enactment 
It has not been a grand
success but it does establish a few
standards of policy which at least
conformed partially to public sentiment 
I t was worked to prevent shipments
of war materials to Spain but
to all other countries including J a pan 
it has not impeded the shipments
of hundreds o f millions which are
necessary for war and war preparations 
A n attempt may be made to reduce
the neutrality to a mere cash and
carry policy under which even nations
at war may buy all they please
of this country so long as they haul
it away in their own ships and pay
cash for their purchases leaving all
else relating to neutrality in the
hands o f the president and the Department
of State The suggestion is
not meeting with wide approval As
a business policy it might promote a
kind o f prosperity here if war occurs
abroad Nations in control o f the
seas could carry and nations which
have cash could buy while others
could do neither It would make our
present policy toward Japan the general
policy Japan has the ships and
loads them daily with war materials 
It also buys our cotton manufactures
cotton goods on a wage scale about
10 per cent of that fixed by our own
 wage and hour law and sends
goods here while our own textile mills
are running part time It also ships
to us 85 per cent of its silk products 
A dollar received here from its shipments
is the equivalent of ten times
that buying power in Japan Thus
our neutrality serves Japan remarkably
as it expands its power in the
Pacific and shortens our foreign trade
with other Asiatic countries Amending
the Neutrality Act to give such
favorable support to some other nations
will not conform to the general
notion of the public that a neutrality
law should be designed to keep us
out o f all foreign entanglements 
At present we are making warplanes
for France and Great Britain 
and we are at the same time furnishing
plane engines and other plane
parts to Germany Italy and other
European countries Should war come
in Europe it will be fought with materials
produced here in large part 
on both sides of the conflict and in
the main such materials are being
shipped abroad under license and authority
from our own State Department 
Incidentally the financing of
such shipments does not seem to
bother any of the countries purchasing
of us even though they owe us
billions of dollars in war debts International
financing seems to have been
greatly improved in international
banking methods especially since the
last war Under the Johnson Act the
debtor countries which defaulted payment
o f principal and interest on
World war loans cannot legally borrow
any more money here They can
and are obtaining the stuffs which
make wars possible and horrible It
would seem as though the war makers
abroad continue to keep several jumps
ahead of our laws which are intended
to keep us out of foreign entanglements 
The administration is endeavoring
to devise a system of providing credit
for small business firms Several
plans are under consideration By
 small business firms is meant those
having assets o f one million dollars
or less Among the suggestions is that
of insuring loans by banks upon
much the same plan as that of
the Federal Housing Act under which
nearly two billions o f dollars have
been loaned by banks amd associations
and insured for a broad program for
building new homes The Reconstruction
finance Corporation was authorized
by the last congress to make direct
loans to small business firms unable
to obtain credit from local banks 
It surrounded its proposals for such
relief with such regulations that but
few loans have been made 
Along with other suggestions comes
that of Jesse Jones chairman o f the
R F C that the banking methods
should be so changed that local
banks may make long time loans 
even for five or ten years to local
firms and industries under a plan o f
federal supervision and insurance 
The bank reserves have reached even
a higher point than in 1929 Eastern
banks are loaded down with funds 
drawn partially from the smaller
banks o f the whole country One New
York City Bank has deposits of nearly
three billions o f dollars and many
large banks decline to pay interest on
even time deposits Commercial loans
are not increasing over the country
and local banks everywhere have
large amounts in cash and government
securities A way of getting the
bank deposits to work in the communities
in which the deposits are made
might be a practical method of solving
the credit difficulties o f small
firms without the need of another
government plan and bureau to operate
it There are over 380 000 corporations
in the country which come
under the classification of small
business firms 
Both House and Senate are investigating
the Works Progress Administration 
the House by a special committee
recently authorized The Senate
has the W P A appropriation bill
under consideration Its committee
also has before it plans which have
been proffered for changing the program
o f unemployment relief The
House committee will delve deeply
into various phases o f W PA supplementing
inquiries previously made 
Charges o f political influence extravagance
in allotments the merits o f
some projects and numerous other
questions relating to the appropriations
will be gone into It is intended
that the investigation will be completed
before the annual bill for relie
f funds is brought up fo r action 
For many years the matter o f the
importation o f foreign fats and oils
in competition with our own vegetable
and annual oil production has
been before congress Odd as may be 
it is a question over which the various
agricultural sections are in
agreement Still attempts at legislation
continue to fail because of the

Wm McNeel assistant state 4-H
club leader will be with us on Wednesday 
April 19th to assist with the
annual tree planting demonstration at
Castle Mound As in former years
4-H club members who have placed
orders for pine and spruce seedlings
for their forestry project will assist
with the planting 
An order has been placed with the
Conservation Department for 30 000
seedlings for 90 4-H club members 
Club members will be asked to plant
all seedlings in a transplant bed in
the garden where they may be cultivated
for one or two years until they
reach the desired size for transplanting 
Club members who have placed orders
for seedlings will find it worthwhile
to attend the tree planting demonstration
on Wednesday April 19 
Mr McNeel will discuss the problems
concerned in the handling o f seedling
from the time they are distributed
through the transplating date 
Proper planting methods are necessary
if one expects to have success
with the transplant beds and windbreaks 
Those 4-H club members who attend
the tree planting demonstration
next Wednesday will be able to obtain
their seedlings immediately following
the demonstration 
Horse Sleeping Sickness
A new vaccine for Horse Sleeping
Sickness which was tested in certain
territories last year with remarkable
protective results is being made available
throughout the United States
this season in the fight against the
onward march o f this disastrous disease 
The new vaccine which is being
released for use by veterinarians at
last promises success in the farmers 
battle against a disease which has
swept the country during the last
several summers killed literally tens
of thousands of valuable horses and
cost American farmers millions upon
millions of dollars 
This new type o f Encephalomyelitis
vaccine is made from chick embryos 
is prepared only in laboratories licensed
by the United States Department
o f Agriculture Bureau o f A nimal
Industry Two doses of vaccine
administered by the veterinarian 7
to 10 days apart assure a high degree
of protection during the summer
and early fall when most losses occur 
Vaccination should be done early
in spring for best results the
months of April May and June being
most favorable 
The importance of this new protective
measure is seen when a study
is made of the history o f Horse Sleeping
Sickness in this country First
noticed in 1912 a disease believed to
be sleeping sickness attacked horses
over widespread western regions 
Since 1930 the disease has spread
rapidly throughout the west and midwest
and into the eastern states In
1935 about 30 000 cases were reported 
in 1936 7 000 and in 1937
more than 170 000 cases were reported
in 30 states Last year the
disease had spread to nine new states
and latest returns indicate that well
over 120 000 animals had sleeping
sickness last year with a loss o f about
21 per cent 
Dr H W Schoening Chief of
Pathology United States Department
of Agriculture in an address before
members of the Horse and Mule Association
o f America December
1938 stated that the new chick embryo
vaccine will give all season protection
against losses in horses due to
sleeping sickness Measures for the
control of the disease according to
Dr Schoening should be directed
along two lines 
All horses should be vaccinated to
increase their resistance to infection 
Animals should be kept as free as
possible from insects such as flies
and mosquitoes that are known to
transmit sleeping sickness from in fected
to healthy animals The use
of fly sprays fly nets and other
practices designed to reduce exposure
to insects is recommended 
Horse owners will find it to their
advantage to organize in groups when
they ask for the services of a veterinarian 
Vaccinating will be done at
reduced prices where 25 or more
horses can be vaccinated at one time 
I will be glad to help organize groups
by furnishing cards for all farmers in
any community 
For best results hire a reliable veterinary
and use a reliable product

weighty influence of industries thriving
upon such importations Over a
20-year period it has been noted and
commented upon that from the proprietors
of some o f the larger of such
industries come liberal campaign contributions
to the rival parties Whether
or not such contributions are a
factor the only advance made was in
levying the excise tax on cocoanut
oil principally from the Philippines 
That tax amounts to about $14 000 -
000 a year but through the generosity
of the same congress which levied
the tax the receipts are paid to the
Philippine government so our Treasury
has not benefitted Recently an
attempt was made in the Senate to
impose a higher excise tax but it
failed the State Department insisting
that the additional levy would interfere
with certain reciprocal trade
agreements now in effect Cotton
growers dairymen and stock-raisers
are well united in opposition to the
use of billions of pounds of imported
oils annually but as Mark Twain said
about the weather Everybody talks
about it but nobody does anything
about it It is estimated that sixteen
million acres would be required to
produce the amount of oil now imported 
but of course production
here would cost more than in the tropical
countries wtere labor is cheap

A fter rising steadily for seven
years deaths from diabetes in Wisconsin
dropped sharply in 1937 to
773 according to the bureau of vital
statistics 
A t the close of 1935 Wisconsin 
Michigan Minnesota Montana Oklahoma 
Louisiana and Florida had increases
of 30 per cent or more in
diabetes mortality in a period of five
years 
The survey disclosed that elderly
persons suffered the brunt of the in- 
creased mortality while the death
rate among younger persons actually
decreased 
Hence when the steadily increasing
percentage of elderly persons in
our population is considered Wisconsin s
seven-year increase in diabetes
deaths should not cause undue alarm 
according to Dr Cornelius A H arper 
state health officer 
The discovery o f insulin in 1922 
and its widespread use as a means
of counteracting the deadly effects
of diabetes has brightened the lives
of thousands of Wisconsin people who
would be doomed to untimely death
without it A more recent discovery
is protamine zinc insulin for which
several advantages over insulin are
claimed he pointed out 
Those engaged in sedentary work
are particularly susceptible to diabetes 
and should ward it off by exercise 
frugal eating and by keeping
a little under average weight 
Diabetes is sly in its attack developing
slowly and exciting little attention
from its potential victim 
Hence it is important to have occasional
physical examinations which
include the significant urine and
blood tests Discovered early diabetes
yields readily to the alleviating
effects of insulin properly administered

Dr F E Sillick o f Neillsville 
Wis says 
 Sleeping sickness in horses is
purely a diet and system condition 
 Due to abnormal feeds and feedin
g o f the last seven years the systems
o f all animals have become acid
and bacteria grows in acid 
 Be sure that horses have free access
to salt at all times and plenty
o f fresh water also alkalines such as
soda or lime in their feed or water 
 Sleeping Sickness is a new name
for one o f the oldest diseases in veterinary
history and it is not contagi-
! ous and it cannot be carried or given
to any horse whose system is normal
