GLENDENNING TRUCK
TURNS OVER
A Glendenning semi-truck went over
the bank o n German Hill about
3 a  m  Tuesday morning  It was on
its way from Chicago to St  Paul 
The storm was pretty well under way
at that time and the truck couldn t
make the hill  started to back  jackknifed 
and went over the 50-foot
embankment  The two drivers jumped
as it went over and neither of them
was hurt  The trailer was lying on its
side the cab  held up by the trailer 
stood on its back wheels  They called
for the company wrecker and it was
about 9 p  m  when the truck got out
and away last night 
Just to show how fate takes care
o f car drivers and the like it is interesting
to know that the second
driver  who was asleep  woke up at
the depot  The driver suggested that
he might as well sleep but he thought
he would sit up  He put on his shoes
and was sitting up wide awake as the
truck went over 
There were many big trucks held
up here last night  There had been
about 12 inches of snowfall and the
high wind caused many drifts 
NEW TOWN ADDED TO
JACKSON COUNTY
A petition was circulated in August
o f 1937  for the division of the town
o f Albion to create the town of Allen 
That petition came up for hearing
in March  1938  The matter was
referred to Albert Knutson  special
referee  He reported to the court that
a majority of the electors of the town
had not signed the petition and therefore
the petition was denied 
Then a new petition was circulated
to create the town of Adams and at
the first hearing F  N  Nelson  of City
Point was appointed special referee
to determine whether or not the petition
came within the requirements
o f the law  He reported that it fulfilled
all requirements and during November 
1938  the Court signed an
crder creating the town of Adams 
The town will be organized on the
date set for the annual town meeting
which is the first Tuesday in April 
Notice of the caucus for the town of

far as Castle Mound  just east of

road and into a ditch  Fortunately
neither of them or the car were injured
in any way but Judge Crosby
had enough of driving for that day 
He returned to town and waited for

ED LO CK EN   S LIFE STO RY OF
STRUGGLES AND PROGRESS
This is the story of Ec Locken  Not
the Ed Locken we see every day
about 11 o  clock in the morning taking
his quiet and purposeful way
home  but that Ed Locken on the
long journey over an 80-year-long
road  which he has traveled as quietly
and as purposefullly as he takes
his daily trip home for dinner 
Although Mr  Locken still goes to
his store every day he has  happily
turned over the active management
o f the business to his son  Enoch 
One cannot be as busy as he has been
all his life and give up work easily 
So as long as he can  Mr  Locken will
spend time in the repair shop at the
rear of the store  The picture of him
which accompanies this article was
taken in that shop  It is an excellent
likeness of him at his work  It
was taken by Jack Sypulski  of this
city  and appeared recently in the
Milwaukee Journal  The next day
Mr  Locken had a letter from Julius
S  H off  of New Richmond  congratulating
him after seeing the picture
and recalling the pair of finest boots
with green leather top trimming that
Mr  Locken had made for him when
he was confirmed 53 years ago 
The ability to make those boots
was acquired years and years ago in
Norway  by a young man who had
been born January 3  1859  at Gulbrandsdalen 
Norway  the youngest o f
three brothers  sons of Engebret and
Sigre Engebretson  When 19 years
o f age he started to learn the trade
o f shoemaking from his brother 
John  who was six years older  He
had six years of experience before
coming here 
W e were very much interested in
the manner in which he learned his
trade  and the manner in which he
carried it on  In this day and age
when our young people think shoes
are laid in boxes like eggs it is o f
particular interest 
He and his brother traveled from
home to home  making shoes for the
members and the help  They took
the cow hide right from the tannery 
a home product  It took a whole day
to prepare the hide  First they soaked
it thoroughly in water  stripping
it clean on a block especially prepared
for the work  When the leather
was just right for blacking it was
dyed with home-made dye consisting
o f sour whey and scrap iron  They
would heat pieces of iron and throw
them in the whey  Every farm had
a tub prepared for the purpose o f
making the solution and it was an obsolutely
thorough dye  A fter the
leather was just right and only a little
moist  they worked the oil  consisting
o f strong leaf lard and pine
tar  into it  This was a hard process 
The oil was spread on the hide  it
was rolled up and tied and then they
danced on it to work in the oil  re-
Mrs  Net Hostrawser returned Sun
spent the past month with her chil
day from Milwaukee where she had i peating the process several times undren
and their families  Mr  and Mrs    til the oil was mixed in the leather
Clifford Webster  Mr  and Mrs  Har- | and it was very flexible  Mr  Locken
ley Hostrawser and family  and Mr  said he had danced on leather until
and Mrs  Forrest Hostrawser and
daughter  She had a fine time and
stayed longer than she intended  Her
birthday anniversary was Feb  8 and
her children and their famiiles had a
the sweat ran down his face 
A fter the leather was ready they
took the measurement of the shoes 
fitted the last according to the measure 
cut patterns to fit the lasts and
fine party in her honor for the oc- i then cut the leather according to the
casion  When she left Sunday her
son Harley and one of the boys o f
the family were confined to their
home by an attack of flu  which is
prevalent there as it is in so many
places thismonth 
Ole Rockney of Amery  was the
victim of an accident a week ago
Wednesday which his friends here
will be sorry to learn about  He
slipped on tht ice  fell and broke his
hip  He was taken to the Amery
hospital and has not been getting
along too well as pneumonia developed 
Mr  Rockney has been a veryactive
man always  and being laid
up is hard on him  His daughter 
Miss Alma  lives with him in Amery 
and another daughter  Mrs  Robert
Simms  came from Minneapolis on account
o f his illness  They have been
with him right along 
patterns  There were no sewing machines
and they were all stitched by
hand  Some were made with welt
and most of them with wooden pegs 
Most of the sole leather  even then 
was bought from France or America
and they only used hemlock tan  It
took about a day to make a pair o f
fine dress shoes  They could make
two or three pairs of mens every day
shoes  called here a stitchdown  in a
day  sewing them all by hand  They
put several thicknesses of birch between
the outer and the inner soles
to make them water tight  They cost
all the wav from 75c to $3 00 
With repairing  a pair of work shoes
and a pair of good shoes lasted a person
a year 
A fter six years of this work the
young man was stricken with a fever
which had afflicted many of his chums
and friends  It was the top of the
immigration period  C  A  Kuhn invited the graded and   in the early 80 s 
high school children to the Avalon | He wanted to come to America  He
Theatre Monday after school to see I   He borrowed the $57 necessary
the film   Lincoln in the White ! for his fare and arrived in Black
House    The graded school children ! Kiver Falls May 15  1884  He was
went at 3 15 p  m  and the high then months o f
school students at 4 o clock  It was
an unusually fine film and of great
25 years and five
age  He stayed here five days with
Albert Hanson  who lived on German
historical interest  coming as it did Hill and died only a few years ago 
on the month of Lincoln s anniversary 
Mr  Kuhn s kindness in inviting
the students to see the picture
free of charge was greatly appreciated
by all concerned  Hundreds o f
them saw it 
Reserve the evening of March 24
for the Senior class play 
He had $ 6 in his pocket when he
came here  It was not easy to find
a job in Black River Falls and he
went to Eau Claire to stay with an
uncle for a time 
The young man could not speak a
word of English  He had to depend
on his hands for his living  but he
did not lack courage  A fter about
a month he got a job in a saw mill
in June and worked there until August
1 0 th when a terrible flood washed
away the mill on the Chippewa
river  He got only a few days work
helping pick up refuse from the mill
and then the sky indeed looked dark
for there was no more work and that
fall  1884  _ Grover Cleveland was
elected president for the first of two
terms  Business stopped after election 
some dozen saw mills in Eau
Claire being idle and the streets full
o f men searching for work  Signs
were out   No Men Wanted    Our
young friend was out of luck 
He stayed until late in November 
constantly looking for work and not
finding it  Then he met an old
friend  Lars Halverson  who was on
his way to Black River Falls and took
Mr  Locken down with him  feeling
sure he could find a job for him in
the woods from here  Mr  Halverson
worked for Mr  Homstad at that time 
They arrived at midnight  staying
at the passenger depot until morning 
Again Mr  Locken began his search
for work but did not find any until
December 10th when about a dozen
men hired out to the late W  T  Price
to work in the woods   on the Bruney 
(The Brunnette river  a tributary
o f the Chippewa entering it
north of the Flambeau and Thomapple
rivers ) They left here on the
train and went to Bruce  the end o f
the railroad on the Chippewa river 
They stayed over night  Next morning
they started out through the
woods for their destination two days
away  reaching the camp about 7 at
night  Some of the men had not
been able to stand the long trip and
were delayed in Arrival for a couple
o f days more 
All that winter our young friend
pulled a saw with a friend of his 
Christ M  Gunderson  the same friend
who sent him money for his fare to
this country  About the middle o f
March cam{  broke and they returned
to Black River Falls where Mr  Locken
got his pay from the late Dick
O Hearn at the old Jackson county
bank  _ He had $25 coming and was
paid in gold  They handed him a
$20 gold piece and a $5 gold piece 
He turned to his friend and handed
him the $ 2 0 gold piece 
The next day he hired out to the
late Iver Erickson  father of Mrs  Lillian
Erickson Hochberger  of Chicago 
and Mrs  Edna Erickson Hanson  o f
Culver City  California  to work in
his shoe makers shop  The shop was
then where Matt Christianson's tavera
now stands  The late J  J  Mc-
Gillivray built a big building on the
site a little later and Mr  Erickson
moved his shop to the west end o f
the river bridge  where it now stands 
Mr  Locken hired out for a year  as
he was used to doing in the oid country 
for the sum of $150 and board
and room  He worked two months
over the year  When he quit he had
$ 2 1 coming and in making a settlement
he took three pairs of boots 
which he afterward sold  About then
he raffled a small sewing machine
which he had been given by a man
who was selling them  in exchange
for a pair of boots  He got $15 for
the machine 
Although he did not have money
to do it  friends persuaded him to
start a shop of his own and his first
one was in the Ned Clapp building 
on the present site of Dr  Gebhardt s
home  "piat was in 1886 and he
started in June  In September he
moved to the Art Werner building 
where the Rosmenoski building now
is  then known as the old Snyder
building  The Jackson County Journal
office was in the rear of the same
building  In the spring he moved to
the John Bakken shop  the site of the
present Freeman hotel  He was there
about a year and then moved to the
Elias Johnson byilding  where Merlin
Horswill s barber shop is now located 
In the fall of 1890 he was married
to Miss Anna Ringstad who had been
here from Norway only about two
years  At the same time he bought
the place where he had his shop  as
he had always been against paying
rent  He paid $950 00 for the building
and had saved $500 for a cash
payment  borrowing the remainder 
He and Mrs  Locken lived up stairs 
He fixed up the building  He added
factory made shoes to his stock  the
shoe making business having become
crowded out by factory made shoes 
Along about that time he took in
Louis Liillehammer as a partner  The
flood of 1911 destroyed the store and
stock  Mr  Locken estimated his loss
at $1 0  0 0 0   He and Mr  Lillehammer
dissolved partnership and the latter
moved to Elrov  where he is now 
Mr  Locken bought a lot where his
present store is  and erected the

Everson was the orator 
Banked about the flag-draped casket
were wreaths of floral pieces
from the Masons  the Elks  the
Eagle  the American Legion  other
organizations  relatives and friends 
Kindly were the words of Bishop
Wilson  spoken with the sincerity of
a friend of Mr  Stolts  He pictured
him as the service man of 2 0 years
ago  and then as the active ex-service
man willing to assume his place in
civil life and to assume the responsibilities 
The changes a war brings
to a certain generation were noted 
with reference to the service of the
deceased as district attorney  a leader
in the American Legion and a
willing helper in civic undertakings 
Life did not stop for him at 46 
said the bishop  for here the Christian
faith contributes the answer 
that in the future  the greater life 
there is an increased services  The
high qualities of service we recognize
here are the qualities that continue
hereafter  he said 
The pall-bearers were Max Lasker 
Victor O  Trousdal  Harley Brook  Alex
Gamock  Roy Charleson and Donald
Farr 
The remains were taken to the
home of his mother  Mrs  Rose Stolts
at Sechlerville  where further services
were held on Wednesday afternoon 
and which were attended by a large
concourse of friends of his old home
community  Bishop Frank E  Wilson
officiated  Included among the many
who attended were more than two
hundred World war veterans  including
many from Eau Claire and Chippewa 
Interment was made with military
honors at the Sechlerville cemetery 
where also lie the remains of his
father and brother and sister  his
grandparents and great-grandparents 
The Stolts family was among the first
to locate in the Trempealeau valley
in 1856 
Victor was born on the family
homestead at Sechlerville on June 2 
1892  the son of Mrs  Rose and the
late F  J  H  Stolts  His boyhood days
were spent on the farm and n attendance
at the Hixton schools  Following
his graduation from High school 
he entered the law department of the
| University of Wisconsin  He graduated
from the law school and was
admitted to the bar  Following his
graduation he enlisted for service in
the World war  After the war he
entered the practice of his profession
at Eau Claire  His sterling character
and excellent ability quickly won him
recognition and professional success 
and in 1920 he was elected district
| attorney of Eau Claire  He served
three terms with distinction  and declined
further preferment  devoting
his attention to his private law practice 
Referring to his successful career
in that city  the Eau Claire Leader
briefly recounts his experiences  as
follows 
  Establishing a law practice here
in 1919  at the close of the World
war Mr  Stolts became active in legal 
fraternal  political and civic affairs 
He became immediately active in the
American Legion and remained so
until his death 
  He was a Scottish Rite Mason  a
member of the Eau Claire Elks lodge
and a member of the Eagles lodge
here 
Mr  Stolts began his political career
with election as district attorney
on the Republican ticket in 1920 
He served three terms and then did
not seek re-election 
  In 1934 he won the Republican
nomination for attorney general but
was defeated in the general election 
He was a member for congress in
1928 
Mr  Stolts was the second commander
o f the William C  Johnson
post  American Legion here  being
elected in 1920  and had served on
the post s executive committee since
then  He was elected tenth district
commander of the Legion in 1938 and
was serving in that capacity at the
time of his death  He was general
chairman of the American Legion
state convention when it was held in
Eau Claire in 1935 
  During the war Mr  Stolts was a
regimental sergeant-major in the
Judge Advocate General s department
at Camp Grant  He enlisted at
Madison after graduation from the
University of Wisconsin law school  
Apparently in the best of health
and robust strength  death came to
him suddenly  at the Memorial hospital
at Wausau on Saturday afternoon 
February 18th  1939  of a
heart attack  at the age of 46 years 
8 months and 16 days 
He had gone to Wausau  accompanied
by Attorney Donald Farr  on
the previous afternoon  He became
ill on the way  but revived  and until
Saturday morning his condition was
not regarded as serious  He was taken
to the hospital in the forenoon 
but did not long survive 
He is survived by his mother  Mrs 
Rose Stolts  and one sister  Mrs  Erwin
Bills  of Sechlerville  His sister 
Mrs  Raph Ashton  of Ypsilanti 
Michigan  passed away in 1938  He
is also survived by an uncle  Charles
B  Stolts  and three nephews  Wendell
Ashton  of Ypsilanti  and Donald
and Willard Bills  of Sechlerville 
Though the activities of his busy
adult life were in other places  Mr 
Stolts never lost interest in his old
home community  He frequently visited
his good mother and sister  and
kept in contact with the many other
friends whom he had known from
boyhood  He also retained their constant
interest in his progress and
their warm regard for him 
As a man  lawyer and public spirited
citizen Mr  Stolts fully earned
the success which came to him and
the loyalty and confidence in which
he was held  of strict integrity and
high ideals  he was also generous and
faithful in all his associations  He
was loyal and constant in his friend-

A P P E A L S FOR INDIAN AID
From La Crosse Tribune
Efforts of Wisconsin congressmen
to impress the federal Indian bureau
o f the dire poverty of Indian federal
wards in 25 Wisconsin counties have
proved unsuccessful 
The Indian bureau blandly says it
has no money with which to extend
succor to the Indians 
Congressman Merlin Hull headed
the delegation of Wisconsin congressmen
that visited the Indian bureau 
He received the same answer that has
been accorded by the federal authorities
when appealed to on behalf of
sufFering Indians during the last quarter
o f a century 
Congressman Hull said many Indians
were living in tarpaper wigwams
and practically feeding on berries and
the little game they can find at this
time of the year  He said food  better
housing  and better medical care
are necessary immediately for these
Indians 
It is time the federal government
waked up to the condition of Wisconson
Indians still in tribal relation 
Those on reservations are being meagerly
cared for but they are in better
shape that those living outside o f
the government areas 
Many Indians have been robbed of
their land  which the government allowed
them to sell for a mess of pottage 
Now that they are suffering
because the government has been a
negligent guardian  offi ials sitting in
swivel chairs in warm Washington o ffices
say no federal moneys are available
to provide even bare necessities
for the Indians the government promised
to protect 
The situation of m aiy Indians in
Wisconsin is deplorabls and a blot
upon the nation  The government is
duty bound to care for these people 
Somehow its officials seem utterly
blind to the obligation

the work  The paper on which it is
sent to press is one-third larger than
the finished work  All the typing
must be absolutely perfect  It must
be perfectly arranged becaus eit is

BLACK RIVER FALLS
FOREIGN N E W SPA PERS
When reading one of our daily
newspapers  one often wonders what
sort of newspaper they have in Europe 
A talk with Mrs  Nellie Mitchell
who traveled in Europe for
three years  helped to answer this
question 
By profession Mrs  Mitchell is a
linotype operator  so naturally she
took particular notice of the European
papers  especially from a printer s
angle 
Mrs  Mitchell visited about sixty
daily newspapers while in Europe  On
the whole  they are as modem and
they are similar to those in America 
Most of them are published tabloid
in size which is the same as our
American papers 
The papers in England are much
like our Chicago Tribune  They are
well advanced  or are they  Several
o f the leading ones are the   Daily
Mai]      Daily Telegram  and   Daily
Times   
Mrs  Mitchell had tea with nine
men from a London paper 
The largest newspaper office which
she saw in Europe was in Manchester 
England  where 89 linotypes
clicked together on one floor 
As in other occupations in Europe 
the number of women in the business
is relatively small compared to that
o f America  It was in Copenhagen 
Denmark  that Mrs  Mitchell saw the
only woman linotype operator during
her travels  Her picture was taken
with the woman and published with
an article in the Danish paper 
We have always heard much about
Adolph Hitler s newspaper in Germany 
Mrs  Mitchell visited this also 
Hitler s   Voelkescher-Boelbacher))
(People s Observer) is five years old
and is the National Journalist organ 
It is very modern and has 15 new
linotypes  She received a cordial
welcome from the German papers 
Press censorship in Germany is as
strict as the reports have been  Nothing
is printed without the government s
consent  Last year after Germany
had annexed Austria an Austrian
newspaper refused to follow
this censorship  Shortly afterwards
the whole office  except for the machinery 
was destroyed  So the papers
know better than to defy the
Nazis 
The German people read nothing
but that which the government wishes
them to read  Foreign newspapers 
particularly English  come in by
train  Government officials search
the paper and if there is something
in it that the Germans shouldn t read
they destroy the lot of papers  The
prospective buyer is then told   there
are no papers today  
We in America can be thankful
that we still have that great privilege
of   freedom of the press

years  the Black River Falls High
school belongs to the Wisconsin High
School Forensic League

For spring contests Black River
Falls is placed in the group with Augusta 
Durand  Mondovi  Neillsville 
and Osseo  If we were to compete
in the spring forensic contests for
which we are now eligible  the above
schools would be our opponents

TU E SD A Y EVENIN G LECTURES
For the past eight weeks on Tuesday
night residents and students o f
Black River Falls have been meeting
in the Physics room of the High
school to listen to discussions by
Professor Adolfson of the University
o f Wisconsin 
These discussions dealt with modem
  national  and international topics 
For instance  the study of Fascism
and Communism were carefully
covered 
Prof  Adolfson gave the theory o f
each and then went on to show how
it had developed in the respective
countries 
Five students of the High school
attended  They w ere  Aleen Trask

SECOND SIX-W E EK S EDITORS
TO TA K E CH ARGE
Starting Monday  March 6   a new
group of editors will take charge o f
the Oriole  The Staff will have the
same people on it  but in order that
a greater number of students may
have the experience of responsibility
o f getting out a student newspaper
the editor positions shift each six
weeks  During the school year there
is one exception to this  That exception
is that the editors of the
final six weeks in May will remain
editors for the first six weeks in the
fall  The reason for this being that
the Oriole wishes to have experienced
editors in charge after the long
vacations 
LIQUID AIR
Last time in the   Oriole  there was
a little written about Mr  Elliot
James but I don t think that was
enough  When a superman (not
from the green sheet) comes to
school it should be recalled  Never
before did we have a person who
made us feel cold for a time after
his experiments  I wonder if it is the
looks of the cold liquid air and its
works  It was hard to believe our
eyes  when the cold air boiled on
water  or having corks flying about
and a little airplane flying around 
I m glad we are not driving cars
with liquid air because we would
never get anywhere because the car
would freeze up  so would the tires 
With liquid air you can make rubber
nails  I wonder who would wish they
could build a house with a mercury
hammer

River Falls High school will see the
last home game of the year  This
is a non-conference game with Neillsville

Senior students in each high school
choose by vote four girls whom they
believe best qualify as good citizens j
on the basis of the above  From the
four girls thus selected the high
school faculty selects one who becomes
the   good citizen  of the
school  Her name is sent to the State
Superintendent of Schools and the
names are drawn from the entire list
by lot  if the girl whose name is
drawn first is unable to go  the second
may take her place and if she is
unable to go  the third is given the
opportunity  The Wisconsin girl will
meet the representatives of other
states in Washington where three full
days of sight-seeing make up the pilgrimage
and each girl is awarded the
good citizenship pin 
The class of 1939 choose as its outstanding
students  Mary Boyer  Aleen
Trask  Betty Thomas  and Jane Davis
from which list the faculty selected
Mary Boyer  Let us hope that Mary
may be the lucky girl to be drawn
to represent Wisconsin on the good
citizenship pilgrimage to Washington

Hiyo Silver! The Rambler rides
again (destination unknown)  Hiyo!
It s the Haralson family again 
They can always be relied upon  Now
its Jean and Norman Martinson  tho j
that isn t particularly new  And
Poozle Hoffman has been shining
around lone  but she still is very satisfied
with her blond  Oh  and incidently 
watch for an important romance
among the upper classes to
break soon  None other than bassslappin 
Erwin Peterson is in the lime
light this week  We thought his
charms were pretty well taken care
o f by Donna Quackenbush and Jeanette
Lee  However  rumor has it that
none other than Merle Halverson
planned on taking him to the senior
party! Could be 
What s happened to all that pep
the basket ball team had at the start
o f the season  Granted  we can t always
win  but there s nothing like
being a good loser 
Question of the week  Has the
Junior class president chosen his
queen yet  What s the matter  Stan 
can t you decide or are you just bashful 
O
ne bright young -miss about
school was wondering why we don t
have a   Sade Hawkins Day    If you
read Lil  Abner in the comic strip
you ll know that such an event (an
old hillbilly custom) is one day in
which the girls all run after the boys
and date the one they catch  (Does
this mean that the girls do the financial
honors too ) Anyway  not a bad
idea  but some gals don t need a special
day for it  (       )
It seems that Butch Carish was so
sleepy in geography class the other
day that he just couldn t keep his
head up or eyes open  Mr  Jorgenson 
hoping to catch him  suddenly
said   Robert  what s the shape of the
earth    Little Butch surprised every
one by correctly but sleepily answering
  Round      And how do you
know its round Bob    continued Mr 
Jorgenson    All right    said Butch 
  it s square then  I don t want to
start any argument about it  
With winter here  can spring be
far behind  And then  tis when a
young man s fancy turns to love 
This promises to be  well  interesting 
to say the least 
When we ramble  even we don t

The Only Tire Made with the'
NEW  SAFETY-LOCK CORD BODY
and NEW GEAR-GRIP T R E A D      
N e v e r before in our experience has a tire
met with such instant and unanimous approval
as the new Firestone Champion Tire  It s the
Safety Sensation of 1939! Our customers have
started a word-of-mouth campaign
that is making this the biggest
selling tire we ve ever had  Motor car
manufacturers have been so impressed
by its superior performance that they
have adopted it for their 1939 models 
W hy  Because the Firestone
Champion Tire is an entirely new
achievement in safety engineering 
S t r o n g e r C o r d B o d y   This
is accomplished first  by the use
o f a completely new type of tire cord
called   Safety-Lock   in which the
cotton fibers are more compactly
interwoven to assure cooler running
and provide greater strength  Then 
the fibers in each individual cord 
the cords in each ply and the plies
themselves  are all securely locked
together by a new and advanced
Firestone process of Gum-Dipping
which provides amazingly greater
strength  And greater strength
means greater safety 
M o r e N o n -S k id M ile a g e   The new Safety-Lock cord
construction provides the extra strength needed for the use of
the new  thicker  tougher  deeper Firestone Gear-Grip tread
which delivers remarkably longer non-skid mileage  Thi 
sensational new tread is called   Gear-Grip  because of its
unique design   it has more than 3 000 sharp-edged angles
which grip the road with a sure-footed hold to protect against
skidding and assure a safe stop 
Drive in today and equip your car with a new set of
Firestone Champion Tires   the only tires made that are
sajety-proved on the speedway for your protection on the highway

The new   Wisconsin Agriculture   
Bulletin No  188  is now available to
those who are interested in the state s
largest industry  farming  According
to the Crop Reporting Service of the
Wisconsin and United States Departments
o f Agriculture here are some
o f the many facts about Jackson
county which will be found in this
economic summary of Wisconsin agriculture 
About 60 per cent of the land in
Jackson county is used for farming 
With about 2 528 farms in the county
the total amount of land in farms
is 381 286 acres  According to the
last census the value of the land and
buildings was more than $11 073 088 
Estimates show that there are about
38 100 head of cattle in the county
o f which about 24 400 are milk cows 
The farm value of the dairy herds in
the county on January 1  1938  was
$1 781 200  Farms in the county
produce about 117 million pounds o f
milk annually 
In order to feed the livestock 
farmers in the county raise large
quantities of feed crops  Esctimates
show that the average acreages o f
some of the feed crops for the 2 0
years  1917-36  were 28 370 acres o f
corn  45 132 acres of oats  5 156
acres of barley  and 38 586 acres o f
tame hay 
About 22 percent of the farms in
Jackson county are operated by tenants 
O f the 78 percent of the
farms operated by the owners  54
percent are mortgaged  The study o f
farm mortgage debt on these owneroperated
farms in the county shows
that it is about 51 percent of the total
value of the farms 
  Wisconsin Agriculture    Bulletin
No  188  was edited by the Wisconsin
Crop Reporting Service and is a
publication of the Department of Agriculture
and Markets  A copy of this
bulletin may be obtained by writing

Madison  Wisconsin 
RICHES
  A ll you can hold in your cold  dead
hand
Is just what you ve given away  
I had been listening to the Gospel
broadcast from a nearby station 
The speaker  a minister of the Church
o f God  had read a poem appropriate
to the message of the hour  the stanzas
o f which ended with the above
lines  in effect  Their import struck
me  altho always have we been admonished
to lay up treasures in Heaven
that when we re ease our hold on
earthly things there will be hoarded
up in Heaven the substance of the
good deeds we have done in the flesh 
Our community had recently been
plunged into sadness by the passing
o f one whom every one loved and respected 
Jennie Merrill  It was a
tremendous struggle to reconcile and
adjust ourselves to the void caused by
her absence  Quietly and without ostentation
Jennie had lived among us
all her life and she had so wound
and woven herself into the web o f
our community life  that we wondered
how we could release her from the
fabric and get along without her  In
the contemplation of this problem
and the thought contained in the Gospel
Hour verse my ideas merged and
standing out alone was this conclusion
  How rich is Jennie! 
Only a day or two before Christmas
she had accompanied our family
to Black River Falls to deliver a basket
o f Christmas goodies and cheer
to loved ones there  I am sure similar
gifts from her hand found their
way to other destinations  Only a
repetition of dozens of holidays in
her life 
Jennie had many talents which she
employed generously  She contributed
freely of her cultured mind and
could always be depended upon to
do her share  when her health permitted 
in the activities of the organizations
o f the town  She lent her
voice in songs of com fort and cheer
on innumerable and varied occasions 
She gave of her possessions  her
time  her home  I have more than
once heard mention of the hospitality
o f the Merrill home 
About all she gave of her heart
and soul  Who  that have had the
care and rearing of infants to maturity 
be they one s own or orphaned
babes  have not  at times  been required
to lay their very selves upon
the altars of sacrifice  She and her
sister Agnes brought a brother s two
motherless children from babes to
adults as tenderly and devotedly as
any mother  an admiration to all witnesses 
My contemplation has only touched
here and there on the extent to
which her talents were utilized and
increased  We are impoverished bv
the loss of her  but we concede with
confidence    How rich is Jennie!

The outstanding feat of the past
weeks bowling was contributed by
I Don Nanstad  subbing for B  A  E  
j on the first shift Wednesday night
when he hung up a fine 256 game for
the season s second high single game
as well as the second highest game
bowled on Nemec s new alleys  The
season  high of 269 was established
by the writer early in the season 
In spite of Don s high game the
Larkin Hardwares trimmed B  A   E  
in the odd game largely due to Myrle
Haralson s 234 game giving Larkins
916 to 902 for B  A  E 
The week s schedule tightened the
race into more of a knot than ever
with Chaimson Maytags still leading
only one game ahead of Moe Clothing 
two games over Millis Contractors
and three games over Hagen
Clothiers  B  A  E   and Tollack Coals
and S  C  S 
In Tuesdays matches Millis Contractors
won three from Hagens and
S  C  S  followed with three in a
row from the Maytags  this by the
way runs the Conservation crew 12
straight wins 
Wednesday night Larkins took two
from B  A  E  and Moe Clothing won

COMMON SENSE CO N SERV ATIO N
By L  H  Kingston
Senator Ingram has introduced bill
198 which will license the hook and
line fisherman in Wisconsir  Under
his proposal no person 18 years o f
age of over and under 70 who has
resided in this state for a period of
one year shall take  catch or kill fish 
or fish for fish with hook and line
rod and reel unless a resident
fishing license has been duly issued
h m 
The great majority of anglers in
this state are hoping that this bill
will be enacted into the law  There
is hardly a hunting and fishing club
in the state that has not endorsed this
proposal  The Conservation Congress
composed of committeemen
from every county has in every instance
unanimously favored this proposed
law 
The hook and line fisherman is recognized
as the only sportsman in
Wisconsin who does not have to pay
his share toward the maintenance of
his sport  The hunter has been buying
his hunting license for years without
a murmur  the rod and reel fisherman
does his share  the trapper
pays to trap but the cane pole fisherman
gets away scot free 
It is a common sight in the summer
to see dozens of cars  big new
ones  coming down the road carrying
s bundle of cane poles that looks
like next winter s supply of firewood 
Watch them out on the lake in a boat 
poles spread out like spider legs  each
pole baited with a live minnow and
you will see each one of them catch
more fish than any six rod and reel
fishermen  Yet the rod and reel man
pays and the hock and line man does
not 
This is an injustice to sportsmanship 
Here we are trying to get people
to go fishirg for fun  and not
for meat on tie stringer  yet our
present rod and reel license law penalizes
the man who gives the fish a
fighting chance 
I know there are a good many anglers
who feel assured that the fight
is won  that the bill is bound to pass
this legislature and be signed bv the
governor  A fter all the votes  that
have been taken among sportsmen
and all the work that has been done
by conservationists it does seem that
there is little question as to what is
in the minds of the citizens of Wisconsin
on this question  But we have
been disappointed before and it may
happen again  Right now before the
showdown we should redouble our efforts
in behalf of the hook and line
license law  Write to your legislators

W ISCO N SIN  S H EALTH
(B y Cornelius A  Harper  M  D  
State Health Officer)
The conversation got around to
comparison of the old days with modern
times  and it sounded something
like this 
Old Wisconsin surely must have
looked beautiful in the early 80 s  before
much of a dent had been made
in the virgin timber 
(In 1881 diphtheria took the lives
o f 2 202 Wisconsin persons  mostly
beautiful babies and young toddlers 
For 1938  only 17 deaths from diphtheria
have been reported in the
state )
Forty years ago  before the automobile
came into its own  the hunting
and fishing in old Wisconsin were
certainly fine 
(Another thing about that period
was the poor defense against typhoid
fever  In 1910 Wisconsin reported
2 446 cases and 558 deaths of that
disease  The typhoid fever record for
1938 shows only 57 cases and five
deaths) 
Well  which is better  being one
o f the 558 who died of typhoid in
1910  or one of the 687 reported to
have been killed by autos in 1938 
all in Wisconsin 
I ll take 1938 as the better period
o f the two  Look at the average age
at death in Wisconsin  In 1910 it
was 40 years  In 1937 is was 57 7
years 
It is pleasant to read about and to
remember the more primitive days of
Wisconsin history  but these days are
better still  We know mo-e about
how to live healthily  We have begun
to replace the forests that were
originally the crowning glory of Wisconsin 
and we practice conservation
o f fish and game

MERLIN H ULL  S LE TTE R
A war boom has started  according
to a prominent eastern economist 
whether or not war is likely to occur 
this summer or next  The immense
sums being appropriated for war preparations
do seem to be boosting
prices on commodities used in making
ready for the conflict  if and when
it does come  Speculation in such supplies
has increased the price of copper 
tungsten  leathers  scrap-iron and
numerous other products  in some instances
by 100 per cent or more  As
the many nations interested in preparations
continue to raise every
dollar they can beg or borrow  the
boom may continue  At the same time
the prices of other commodities seem
to seek lower levels in the world markets 
indicating the sacrifices people
are making for the war boom 
Last year  the world armament
programs called for seventeen billions
o f dollars  This year twenty billions
will be required  a larger amount than
the farm cost of all the food supplies
o f all nations  If there is a war-boom
commencing  it will follow the course
o f other war-booms  and it may end
in both w ar and economic collapse 
Our own country will spend about 10
per cent of war allowances of the
world  this year  Naturally such an
expenditure will expand industries
producing the materials  A very interesting
treatise comes from our own
Navy department  explaining how increased
appropriations for the navy
will help business in all the states 
how it will prime the business pump 
It reads like an argument for the war
boom 
The mails of senators and representatives
are heavily laden with the
propaganda of preparedness  Some of
it comes from government departments 
but much of it seems   inspired 
from sources unknown  The
fear of war is world wide  and we
may have more of it here  Still nobody
o f high or low degree comes
forward to state with authority what
country may be seeking to make war
upon us  Nor  do they explain why 
when a confict in Europe is presumed
by them to be only weeks away  we
are appropriating billions for preparations
which cannot be made or completed
for five or six years hence 
There seems to be a screw loose somewhere
in the propaganda  the cost o f
which seems to be amply financed 
Notwithstanding the flow of arguments
for preparedness  there seem
to be fewer petitions flowing in  protesting
against expenditures for war
purposes  Somehow  peace advocates
are relatively silent  The war scare
may be more far reaching than people
know 
Our   good neighbor  policy toward
South American countries seems to
have struck a snag in Argentine  That
country has ordered a reduction in
imports from our industries by thirty
millions of dollars  particularly imports
o f automobiles  radios and electric
refrigerators  That country owes
us a couple hundred million dollars 
borrowed a number of years ago  for
local improvements which called for
loans with which to pay for them 
Much of that indebtedness is in default
in both principal and interest 
as investors in the bonds of Argentine
well know  It is reported that
an endeavor will be made to complete
the negotiation of a trade treaty with
Argentine  and restore that good
neighborly feeling  But Argentine
wants the treaty to reduce tariffs on
corn  wheat  meats and dairy products 
all of which would compete
even more strongly with mid-west
farm products  particularly those o f
Wisconsin and Iowa  Those two states
purchase more of the commodities o f
our industries in one year than A rgentine
in ten years  and there is no
default on their indebtedness  The
  good-neighbor  policy might well
start here at home 
The Treasury department is reported
to be preparing to ask Congress
to increase the limit on the national
debt from 45 to 50 billions of dollars 
The increase to 45 billions was authorized
only a couple of years ago 
when the debt was under 32 billions 
At that time it was predicted that returning
prosperity and increase of revenues
would prevent the debt increasing
to 40 billions  It now is 39
billions  going up by millions monthly
and with armament expenditures
in prospect it will reach close to 44
billions by July first  With all the
talk that there is no limit to which
national credit may not be expanded 
one naturally wonders what might be
the case in case our country should
get into war 
Debts have a way of growing rapidly 
A few years ago  under the
AAA  loans were made to cotton farmers
on their cotton  The first year 
loans of 1 2 cents per pound were
made  to the extent of 3 000 000
bales  Now the government has
#560 000 000 loaned on cotton  and
is still loaning more on last year s
crop  which was nearly a record
breaker  Though the loans now are
only 84 cents per pound  the costs
for interest  storage and insurance
have brought the average of the loans
to 15 cents per pound  The acreage
o f cotton will be reduced for 1939 
but with a steady increase in yields
due to the greater use of fertilizers 
the crop may not be so greatly curtailed 
Lands that formerly produced
a half-bale per acre have been made
to raise more than a bale to the acre 
In all  the government has about
$750 000 000 loaned out on farm
products  about $190 000 000 on
other than cotton  Wheat loans aggregate
$40 millions  corn loans $90
millions  and peanuts $5 millions 
Loans on turpentine and rosin also
run to $13 millions  on wools $9
millions  The entire loans on dairy
products are about $19 millions  on
butter  Tobacco loans are close to $5
millions  and prunes are covered by
indebtedness of $2 358 000  Aside
from the steadily increasing account
for cotton  most of the loans are liquidated
more or less promptly  the
farmers paying in $547 millions on
those made in previous years  If all
our foreign loans were paid as fully
as have been loans obtained by farmers 
there would be no call made for
increasing the limit of the national
debt 
Rev  A  M  Romstad announces the
first of a series of five Lenten ser
 ices to be held Thursday evening at
S o  clock  The sermon this year will
be based on   Five Great Experiences
in the Life of Jesus    The first of
this series will be on the subject   The
Decisive Start '
Since five years ago when the first
o f these mid-week Lenten services
was announced by the pastor  the
congregations and friends of the con
gregations have responded splendidly
to these calls for special Lenten worship 
This year again the pastor is
anticipating a fine response 
There will be special music at
every service and a free will collection
will be received 
  See from His head  His bands His
feet 
Sorrow and love flow mingled down!
Did e er such love and sorrow meet 
Or thorns compose so rich a crown 
  W erfe the whole realm of nature
mine
That were a present far too small 
Love so amazing  so divine 
Demands my soul  my life  my all  
Rev  Romstad wishes further to announce
that all are most cordially
welcome at the Lutheran church 
whether Sundays or week-days    The
Christian Church is essentially the
fellowship of all true believers in
Jesus Christ as God and Savior    he
declares    It is a community of believers
meeting together for prayer 
praise and worship  The Church is
truly to be found wherever the sacraments
are rightly administered and
the Word of God rightly taught 
 Where two or three are gathered together
in my name  there am I in the
midst of them   Jesus is God's Word
to man  He is God made manifest
in the flesh  He is  the Way  the
Truth and the L ife    Neither is there
salvation in any other  for there is
none other name under heaven given
among men  whereby we must be
saved   Start with the first of these
mid-week services  attend them all 
and you will have received five
glimpses into the life of Jesus Christ
and His work for the salvation of the
soul  
Every one is also most cordially
invited to attend the Sunday morning
services  The next two Sundays
will conclude the series on the Ten
Commandments  after which there
will be sermons on   The Human
Jesus  and   The Divine Jesus

Madison will miss a well known
and honored citizen in the death of
Bryan J  Castle 
For many years Mr  Castle has
been a familiar figure to the citizens
of Madison  Although he lived to the
advanced age of 90 years  he retained
sufficient health up to within a
few months ago to be often seen  an
erect and tall figure  walking with an
alertness of much younger men 
Madison knew and loved h m and the
greetings citizens gave him were always
cheerily answered 
Mr  Castle was for many years in
state service  His work was always
valuable in any department to which
he was attached  He came to the
capitol in 1882 and he served in the
department of public lands from 1882
to 1890 and from 1899 to 1918 
During the war stress he was attached
to the adjutant general s department
and later he was a member
o f the rehabilitation board which
looked after the needs of the returned
World war soldiers  Former Gov 
Emanuel L  Phillipp placed him on
the civil service commission and for
12 years he was a member of that
board 
Now Mr  Castle has passed to his
long rest  He was not only an able
and efficient public servant but a
good citizen  His friends  who were
numerous in all parts of the state 
will feel a personal loss 
Bryan J  Castle throughout his entire
life was not only a faithful servant
to the trusts imposed upon him
but a man who won a well deserved
public esteem 
Mrs  Rose Clarin and daughter 
Miss Anna Elsie  who have been
spending the winter in California 
plan on leaving for home tomorrow 
according to a letter received by Miss
Junettie Erickson  If they could look
in today we are of the opinion that
they would postpone their return for
a time as Black River Falls and vicinity
are tied up in the heaviest
snowstorm of the season in this section 
Mrs  Berthilde Johnson is reported
as improving in condition and feeling
fairly well in spite of the fact that
she is still in bed  Her family and
friends are much encouraged as to
her condition  She collapsed following
the death of her daughter  Mrs 
Hubert Johnson  and has since been
seriously ill 
BIRTH S
A ten pound daughter was bom
February 19  1939  to Mr  and Mrs 
George Avery  at the Deaconess hospital 
Milwaukee  The mother was
formerly Miss Charlotte Fremstad 
daughter of Mr  and Mrs  Stener
Fremstad of Winegar 
A son  James Walter  was bom at
the hospital  February 23  1939  to
Mr  and Mrs  Walter Neiderloh  o f
this city 
A daughter  Mary Alice  was bom
February 26  1939  at the hospital
to Mr  and Mrs  Lester Wagner  o f
this city 
A daughter was bom at the hospital 
February 24  1939  to Mr  and
Mrs  Lawrence Murphy  of this city 
The economic experts are turning
a bit of their attention to the
money question  bringing out the fact
that in bank accounts and in currency
outside banks there are more than
32 billions of idle cash  This amount
is 5 billions more than was the case
in 1929  If all that idle capital were
to be put at work  the depression
soon would quit our shores  Still with
all the idle cash now in banks  government
agencies continue to press
small farmers and home owners for
payments on their indebtedness  so
that the same agencies may turn more
money into the banks and into idleness 
The life insurance companies
are doing likewise  Such corporations
now hold $800 000 000 of farm real
estate  obtained at foreclosure sales 
In Iowa  two per cent of the farms
now are owned by the insurance companies
and two per cent more by the
federal land banks  More foreclosures
mean more idle capital  and more
idle men  If half as much attention
could be obtained in government circles
as has been given to fortifying
the Island of Guam  the past month 
it might be possible to bring the foreclosure
question to the front  but the
war people now have the stage  and
the publicity  MERLIN HULL 
A t the weekly meeting of the Lions
club held Monday night at Lloyd s
there was the usual good attendance
and unusually good entertainment 
Following dinner and the business
turned the meeting over to Warden
meeting President L  D  Anderson
J  W  Jonas  who had four interest
ing reels of film along conservation
lines  He showed scenes of fishing
on the Flambeau and Brule rivers 
setting seines for wall-eyed pike on
Big Pine Lake  and the Poynette
game farm  You could see them really
catching muskies on those reels 
The pictures were as educational as
they were entertaining  and were very
much appreciated 
At the business meeting of the club
that night M  W  Marquardt was
elected tail twister for the organization
and Cortez Hahn was eelcted a
member of the board of directors to
replace Dr  Harry Mannis  who had
moved to Sparta 
County Supt  Millard  of Clark
county  and Conservation Warden A1
va Clurrpner had driven down from
Loyal that night with the projector
used to show the films  and remained
for the program 
REPU BLICAN R A L L Y D RAW S
GOOD CROW D
The Republican Rally and banquet
held last Friday night at the Freeman
hotel proved to be a very interest
ng affair  There were about 75
present 
Carl Peterson  of Milwaukee  the
speaker of the evening  gave a very
interesting talk which had the close
interest of his audience 
Lots of people will remember the
two young men  Carl and Rudy Schubert 
who stopped over night here
with their 7-dog team and five
month-old puppies about two weeks
ago  They kept them over night at
the Hoffman   Hollenbeck bam 
They spent the afternoon at school 
and practically all the children had an
opportunity of examining the outfit
first hand  The leader was a big
black Labrador  the other dogs Huskies 
They had traveled about 1500
miles when here and it had taken
them two months to come from Cumberland
House  a small trading post
in northern Saskatchewan  They had
set out with Chicago for their destination
and an ambition to see if they
could make it  Friday night of last
week we (the proverbial editor and
the proverbial flea) were returning
to the Sherman Hotel in downtown
Chicago about six o  clock  A huge
crowd of spectators packed the curb
at the entrance  We had a hunch it
was the dog team and sure enough
it was  When we got near enough to
see what was the center of attraction
there they were  The team had dropped
in its tracks  The two bareleaded
young men looked equally
worn out  The only signs of life
were in the five puppies  now about
six weeks of age and pert as you
jlease  standing on their hind legs
in the long narrow box in which
they rode in state and with their
noses between their paws on top 
The sledge had been equipped with
small rubber tired wheels  The door
men slammed open the revolving
doors and along with a freezing gale 
the dog team swept into the lobby
and dropped on the floor without a
flicker of interest in the curious
crowd  the reporters or the flashlights

last Wednesday in the church parlors 
The ladies having birthdays in
the first six months entertained those
whose birthdays come in the last six
months  There were 36 ladies present

event

1898 he bought a lot in the first ward
and built the fine home where he
and Mrs  Locken now live  which they
have occupied for 40 years  As he
says  he had no business education
and it was hard  and that he had always
believed in doing business on a
  pay as you go  basis and consequently
things went slow  In 1915
Mr  Locken changed to a cash business
and has been carrying on that
way ever since  He found it paid because
he could always pay his bills
and take every cent of discount 
He has been a member of the
Lutheran church for the past 45 years

faithfully in various offices  and although
still a member he has retired
from holding office

C O O P E R A T IV E NEW S
  Cooperative Week  for 1939 has
come and gone  but the memory o f
the events that took place will long
remain in the hearts of the people
o f Jackson county 
One of the interesting points disclosed
is the amount of business
transacted by our cooperatives during
1938  A fter checking over the totals
carefully and not counting the business
done by the Credit Union or the
Jackson County Electric Coop   it totals
approximately one and one-quarter
million dollars 
The home talent play   The Spider s
W eb    presented by the Coop 
Study club of Black River Falls  was
played twice during the week  It enacted
on the stage the dramatic tragedy
that is taking place in every
community  The play is well directed
and acted  and those taking part are
deserving of much praise and favorable
comment as to their theatrical
ability  It was played Wednesday
evening at the Falls theatre and at
York Saturday  as well as making a
Maying tour of the county  They
lave playing engagements at Galesville
and Fall Creek  It is hoped that
they will make another presentation
at Black River Falls 
Thursday they will present the play
in Minneapolis at the West hotel ball
room at 9 15 p  m  It will be sponsored
by the Midland Coop  convention
which is being held there 
The Coop  film    The Lord Helps
Those Who Help Each Other  and a
conservation film   The River  was
shown two times during the week 
at North Bend Wednesday and Alma
Center Friday  Large attendances
were reported at each showing 
For the past four weeks_ the Cooperative
Publishing Association o f
Superior has been sending the   Cooperative
Builder  without charge to
all the directors of our cooperatives
in the county  It is hoped that the
  Builder  has made many new friends
in Jackson county and that the_ leaders
o f our cooperatives will decide to
make it a weekly visitor in their
homes

TRIB U TE TO
MR  AN D MRS  LAU GH NAN
The following was written in commemoration
o f the golden wedding
anniversary of Mr  and Mrs  Daniel
E  Laughnan  which was celebrated
February 19  1939  It was sent by
the Charles McDade family  of Chicago 
They were at one time residents
o f Shamrock  but moved to
Chicago when their children were
small  Mr  McDade is a cousin o f
Mrs  Laughnan and they have often
visited at the Laughnan home  It is
a nice tribute  one that their friends
will enjoy  It follows 
Daniel E  Laughnan is the second
oldest of four sons  He was bom in
Rockford  111   in 1861  While a
young man he acquired a homestead
in Jackson County  Wisconsin  about
40 miles northwest of La Crosse  deciding
to wrest his fortune from the
soil  and with such success that he is
today rated among Wisconsin s successful
farmers  On February 19th 
1889  at the age of 28  he married
Anne O Connor  a daughter of the
famed old Badger state  who was
then 17  The ceremony was performed
in St  Patrick s church at
Sparta by the Rev  Henry Flock  the
pastor 
Mrs  Laughnan 
As a bride  she was just a shy slip of
a girl
With hair dark as midnight  with a
wee bit of curl 
With black eyes always shining with
mischief and fun
And a smile always kindly  and
bright as the sun 
A good wife and mother  a good
neighbor  too 
To husband and children she always
was true 
Her home was a castle  always spotless
and clean
Where love always reigned  she the
sovereign queen 
Mr  Laughnan 
A man of sterling qualities  respected
and admired 
To be just to all his fellowmen  was
one thing he desired 
A good husband and good father  he
labored through the years
To shield his loved ones from life s
cares  its trouble and its fears 
A good neighbor and good citizen 
does his duty to the state
And like all good loyal Americans 
thinks the U  S  A  is great 
May he live to be a hundred  and
his good wife Anne the same 
And may the name of Laughnan always
be an honored name 
Their Children 
First came Daniel Junior  and  cause
he was a boy
Both parents were so happy  their
hearts were filled with joy !
Then Teresa and Grace  Ruth and
Florence  that s four 
All arrived on the scene for their dad
to adore 
Next William and Leo  making three
sons to date 
And last  but not least  Miss Edna
made eight 
All fine boys and girls  with a bit
o f the Blarney 
Sure their ancestors all must have
hailed from Killarney 
F E B R U A R Y W EA TH ER

SE K O V REDUCING STUDIO
122H South Barstow Street

A V IS IT TO THE
TO M AH INDIAN H O SPITAL
Last Thursday afternoon the writer
had the privilege and pleasure of
a visit to the big Indian hospital  located
north of the city  and spent upwards
o f an hour with Dr  A  E 
Winter  inspecting the hospital and
interviewing several of the patients 
We were impressed with the building
and equipment  which is entirely
modern and complete in every detail 
and still more impressed with
the atmosphere of thoroughness and
care which pervades the hospital and
is extended on toward the comfort
and welfare of the patients 
There were 39 patients in the hos
pital Thursday  that total being reached
about a half hour before our arrival 
when a baby was born  There
are old and young  suffering from
various ailments  being treated in
this fine hospital  and all with whom
we talked were highly pleased with
the place and the treatment they received 
Two or three patients had
been transferred there from other
hospitals and they were apparently
gratified with the agreeable change 
Every means known to modern medical
science is being used to make
these patients comfortable and every
effort is being employed to relieve
and remedy their ailments  all of
which is under the intelligent and
sympathetic guidance of Dr  Winter 
Equipped with all that is new and
available for making examinations
and treating the various ailments is
supplied the doctor  the equipment including
a complete operating room 
x-ray and the various lights in diagnosis
and treatment 
The hospital houses a complete
kitchen for the preparation of meals
for the patients and workers and a
home for the staff of nurses  o f
which there are five  Dr  Winter resides
in a snug dwelling that is separate
from the hospital 
Great stores of food  medical and
linen supplies are kept in store-rooms
at the hospital  Oil furnishes fuel
from two big boilers 
The east end of the main floor of
the big fireproof building is given
over to quarters for the nurses  The
entire basement is used for kitchen
and storage rooms  while the other
floors are occupied by patients and
operating rooms  The west end o f
two floors is occupied by tubercular
patients and this part is kept closed
off from the other wards  There are
several tubercular patients at the
hospital now and all appear to be
making headway  although some were
so far advanced before coming to the
hospital that progress is slow 
There were several cases of varying
bone ailments and many other
cases of which we did not learn the
trouble  All of these are being given
the very best of treatment and the
response is encouraging 
In all this maze of scientific treatment
and illness and repairing of human
bodies  we were impressed with
the personal interest of Dr  Winter
in the welfare of his patients and the
pride with which he pointed out the
progress of this or that patient  Here 
we could readily understand  was a
doctor whose utmost interest lies in
diagnosis and cure of those intrusted
to his ministrations and his neverfailing
interest is doing much to accomplish
some remarkable rescue work in
this government Indian hospital 
Dr  Winter has been employed as
a doctor among Indians since February 
1909  a matter of 30 years  He
started as physician at the Indian
school at that time  and when the
district Indian hospital was erected 
he was selected as the physician in
charge  He understands these Indian
people and their problems and they
are surely fortunate in having a man
o f Dr  Winter s interest and temperament
to treat them during illness 
And the government is also fortunate
in having him on this important
detail   Tomah Monitor-Herald
IN TEREST RA TE REDUCED
The Neillsville Production Credit
Association reduced interest rate to
members one-half of one per cent on
all money advanced beginning Feb 
24  Mr  Horswill  secretary-treasurer 
announced for the board of directors 
  This is made possible    said Secretary
Horswill    by the continued
ready sale to the investing public o f
federal intermediate credit bank debentures
bearing low rates of interest 
and by the favorable operating
results of the intermediate credit
banks and production credit associations
during 1939   He explained that
the farmers  notes which the association
takes are discounted with the
Federal Intermediate Credit Bank o f
St  Paul 
  The new rate will he four and
one-half per cent a year  and as usual
interest will be charged only for the
period which the members actually
have the money  The reduction is
also effective in all the other production
credit associations throughout
the country    
  This is the lowest rate at which
production credit has been made
available and the lowest discount rate
made by the federal intermediate credit
banks  Based upon the present
volume of business this interest reduction
will result in annual savings
o f approximately $800 000 to the
243 000 members of the 535 production
credit associations in the United
States  
The Neillsville Production Credit
Association  according to Secretary
Horswill  last year did a business totaling
$384 221 00    These loans   
he said    are made for agricultural
purposes  and repayments are made
at the time when the member is best
able to pay  either from the sale o f
crops or livestock or other operations
financed  Some loans are made on the
so-called budget plan in which members
get a commitment from the association
to advance to them sums
covering certain periods  thus enabling
them to be sure of sufficient
funds to carry them through their
agricultural operations and yet not
have to pay interest on the entire
amount for the whole season  The
budget plan provides for advancing
part of the entire amount as needed  
Bob Virgin  local representative o f
 the Purity Baking Company  of Minneapolis 
was here recently with advertising
for his Taystee bread  copy
for advertising of which begins this
week and will carry through for the
year of 1939  They find advertising
in local papers is a paying business
for their product

IS IT W O R T H W H IL E  
Is it worth while  Will it pay 
Thousands and thousands of young
American students have asked this
question and sincerely so  because
they wanted to know just a little
more about the musical opportunities
to be presented to them 
The demand is oniy for the best 
They must keep that m mind  espe
cially when they stuuy and their stu
dy becomes boresome and tiring 
Modern scnoois have promoted
their instrumental departments  class
music history and appreciation  Ail
instruction  theory Classes  harmony 
these are ottered today to the young
student  Community bands and orchestras
are waiting for the young
graduate student  fraternal bands are
also waiting to give  he young musician
a lilt  Proiessional playing is
coming back with much better salaries 
Television is just about ready
to use many thousands more of
graduates 
Some people will tell you that music
is a disheartening art  Don t you
believe it! In this day and age  music
is given an equal chance and only the
narrow-minded individual will try to
discourage you from taking up music
as either a vocation or avocation 
io u shouldn t think of music for
its financial opportunities oniy  all
the music lovers who are acquainted
with the lives of Bach  Shubert  or
Weber  know that these great composers
were not rewarded in dollars
alone for their manuscripts  Money
doesn t buy personal satisfaction 
The world's most profitable song
ever written was   Listen to the
Mocking Bird    The publishers realized
over $300 000 000 on it while
Septimus Winner  the composer  sold
it for only $35 00 
Will there be room for you after
you graduate   I  ll say there will  for
the great musicians are as scarce as
  hen s teeth    The more practice
you do  the more pleasure you will
derive from this art 
Opportunity is knocking at your
door  Some advice to all young students 
  take advantage of every opportunity
to play    When you better
yourself  give some help to the band
and orchestra  Be true to yourself
and your music  You will win  music
will pay  and it is worth while

A review of the B  R  F -Merrillan
basket ball game shows a victory for
Black River of 22-15  Both teams
made seven field goals  the rest o f
the points were made on free throws 
Altho the team does not try to use
foolish excuses for the loss  it can be
partly blamed to the large gym floor
on which Merrillan was not used to
playing  Carroll Olson was high
point man for Merrillan with seven
points  Tommy Horswill was high for
B  R  Falls with 8  
Thursday night the boys go to the
tournament at Eau Claire  The first
team they are to play is Elk Mound 
In the preliminary Merrillan s 2d
team was victorious  They have won
several of the last games

lor a novel annual  luucn of wmch is
to be printed in the iugn school here
by mimeograph process 
Early in tne term the Seniors became
interested in publishing an annual 
but tney were discouraged because
o f the expense involved in a
printed yearbook o l usual proportions 
ih e nnmeograpned idea lurmsned
a pian lor publishing an annual
that will be just as valuable as
a keepsake aithougn not so elaborate 
instead of usmg nalitones lo r lllustrauons 
actual photographs of the
classes  buildings  teams  and activities
will be pasted in the book  it is
estimated the book can be produced

' The price you pay for your farm
is always a big facor in your success 
Too high a price is like paying for a

Too heavy a debt load likewise
sink you   finance authorities

Results of farm records on thousnds
of Wsconsin farms show that it
pays in net farm income to have a

H IXTON HIGH SCHOOL
Martin Jacobs has presented the
school with a lovely oriental tapestry 
At present it adorns the back
o f the history room  We are extremely
grateful to Mr  Jacobs who
has always signified his intentions to
do something for the high school  Mr 
Jacobs has been interested in and a
loyal supporter of our school 
To date our Forensic entrants are
Virginia Bergerson and June Letson 
oratory  Mildred Gillis and Ivadelle
Hanson  serious declamations  and
Elva Schoengarth  humorous declamation 
It is expected that these individuals
will have most of their respective
pieces learned by the end o f
this week 
Six weeks examinations are the order
o f the week  With the basket
ball tournament at Whitehall at hand
this proves to be a busy week indeed
for students and faculty  Bring home
the bacon  boys!
What makes a school  Go up to
school some week end when the building
is empty  or linger long after dismissal
on a school day  and you will
answer   It s the students and teachers
that make the school  
Facilities and equipment  it is true 
add much to the efficiency and effectiveness
o f its operation  but the individuals
within the school make it
what it is  Not one individual  not
one class or group but all determine
the progress that is being made 
Those students who keep their
scholastic record high  and who have
the initiative to take part in some
o f the many activities that a school
like H  H  S  has to offer  are the determiners
o f the success of education 
The type of student who does
only enough to barely get by  whose
laziness makes him look with scorn
upon those worth while activities
which require effort  is a type that
tends to pull down the reputation o f
the group as a whole 
That is true as it is in life  _ The
man who is successful in business 
the professions  or farming  has gained
that success by enriching society
with his services or goods  He becomes
a leader in his chosen field and
 s held in high esteem by his fellowmen
The neer-do-well renders little
service to society  nor as a result  to
himself  and few will miss him when
he Is gone 
We are proud that we have students
that are showing the qualities
all admire  We are not so prour o f
a few of the others  To all of us
this is indeed food for thought  Let
us continue to do even better than
we are doing  Let us take care of the
details as well as the seemingly more
important things  let us strive for
greater dependability  resourcefulness 
initiative and courtesy    Let us
be the best of whatever we are

  I make my living pulling wool
over people s eyes  
  That s odd  What are you  a confidence
man  
  Naw  I sell slip-on sweaters   
W H A T AM I 
I am no giant nor monster  but
my back is good and strong 
I carry heavy loads from morn
through all night long 
I carry loads that weigh three ton 
and others many more 
The strangest thing about me is
my work is never o  er 
I carry weary travelers whose feet
are tired and sore 
I carry the rich and famous  I carry
the very poor 
I ve carried the young  I ve carried
the old 
I ve carried the timid  I ve carried
the bold 
I ve carried maidens in distress 
and others that were gay 
I ve heard many lovers name their
wedding day 
I ve carried soldiers who start out
so brave 
I ve carried them again to their
lonely grave 
I am so old  so very old  and yet
I never die 
What am I 
People take no heed of me  nor
think of how I feel 
They put scars upon my back  scars
that never heal 
But when my back gets rough and
sore  one doctor ne ed will do 
I have to have so many that you
might call it a crew 
They dig it and they scrape it and
they make it oh! so flat 
Then they put a sticky plaster in
the middle of my back 
The way they dig and scratch me 
they think I m mighty tough 
The worst thing about the plaster 
they forget to take it off 
The doctors are so rough and they
have a lot of nerve 
They shortened my back and left
out many a curve 
When I was young  so long ago 
my back was just a line 
But now that I am older  it is so
broad and fine 
I am so old I give a little sigh  yet
you do not believe me when I say I
never die 
What am I 
I ve traveled over marshy lands and
over rambling brooks 
I ve traveled through the desert 
and again through shady nooks 
I ve traveled far  I have traveled
wide 
 Tis many a tree has fallen before
my mighty stride 
I ve traveled o er the rockies  I almost
ran in the soa 
I ve traveled far in every land 
they are all home to me 
Sometimes I soar up in the air and
there s a loud refrain
For underneath my feet you hear
the rumble of a train 
Sometimes I carry you where you
cannot see the sky 
Yet as far as I have traveled  yet
I shall never die 
What am I 
I have seen many tragedies  I m the
cause that many die 
Yet they do not heed me when they
know I do not lie 
I m a dumb mute as you know  I
have to talk with signs
If only you would heed me  there d
not be so many fines 
Still they do not heed me  or else
understand the dumb 
Then again I think too many are
too heavily filled with rum 
When you see my signs  stop and
read a line 
I m sure you d save your back and
less blood be shed on mine 
I do a little part too  you know
I am no shirker 
I help to balance the budget  and
give jobs to many a worker 
I have one fault  I know  I make
your taxes higher 
But then you cannot say too much 
you do not care to mire 
I give you jobs  you heard me say
I help to keep the W  P  A 
O f course vou know that I am a
