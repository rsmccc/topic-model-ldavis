$40 Pension Plan
Final senate action is expected this j
week on a pension bill proposing to |
increase maximum monthly aids from j
$30 to $40 per month. The bill is a |
product o f the joint house committee
on pensions and if passed will enable
the state to become eligible fo r the $20
per month maximum federal aid
January 1, 1940.
B efore adjourning fo r the week-end
the senate disposed o f nearly a dozen
amendments to the bill, the most important
o f which proposed to remove
liens on pensioners homes valued up to
$5,000. The amendment was offered
by Senator Ben Gettleman, Milwaukee,
and was beaten by a single vote.
Senator Cornelius Young. Milwaukee,
chairman o f the joint house pension
committee, explained that the
removal o f liens on homes valued up
to $5,000 would add 10,000 persons to
Wisconsin old age pension rolls at an
annual cost o f more than 2bk million
dollars.
B efore the senate votes engrossment
o f tho pension bill it w ill consider an
amendment offered by Senators Roethe
and White proposing to finance the
increased costs o f boosting old age
pensions by raising the state liquor
tax from $1.00 to $1.50 a gallon. This
tax, which is estimated to bring in 3V4
million dollars fo r the biennium, was
included in the first tax bill sent to
the senate by the assembly. The senate
defeated this plan by a close vote.;
H owever, an increased liquor tax earmarked
fo r pensions, now appears
possible.
The estimated total costs to the
state if pensions are to be raised to
the $40 maximum is $10,332,050. The
H eil budget now appropriates $7,786,-
400 fo r pension aids. I f the new bill
passes, the state must add an additional
2 % million dollars to that already
appropriated in the budget.
Facts and Figures
The legislative pension committee
report which recommends that old age
assistance aids be increased to a maximum
$40 per month and a monthly
report by the state pension department
reveals the follow in g facts,
figures, and estimates on Wisconsin’s
pension problems.
During July social security aids of
sligh tly less than lVfe million dollars
was paid to beneficiaries, o f which 1
million dollars was paid to 47,042 old
age recipients.
The average state payment was
$21.27. County averages ranged from
$26.89 in Milwaukee county to $15.58
in Vilas county.
I f the new bill is passed, the comm
ittee estimates that the average pension
payment in June, 1941. will be $25
per month. The county share o f old
age assistance costs will be reduced to
15 per cent. The county now pays 20
per cent.
On June 30, 1930, there w ere 990 old
age assistance recipients in Wisconsin.
In 1935 the number had increased to
5,176. in 1938 to 43.508. Estimates
are that in June, 1940, there will be
53.000 recipients fo r that fiscal year.
Total assistance paid in 1930 was
$156,525. It is estimated that 13H
million dollars will be paid out in the
1939-40 fiscal year.
Reorganization Jobs
F ive major appointments to new
state administrative posts set up
under the 1939 legislature’s reorganization
program have been announced
by Governor H eil and submitted to the
senate for confirmation.
Col. George W. Rickeman. Racine
w ill head the new motor vehicle division,
which consolidates all the motor
licensing and regulations form erly
scattered around in half a dozen state
departments. Rickeman, who is 64
years old, a retired postmaster, and
a m ajor o f the 121st Field artillery
during the world war, w ill receive
$5,000 a year.
Stephen J. McMahon, Wauwatosa,
has been named commissioner o f the
tax commission fo r a six-year term.
He replaces the form er three-man
board abolished in favor o f a oneman
commission and a three-man
board of tax appeals. McMahon, who
is 55, has been a high school principal
and a member o f the Marquette college
o f law faculty, From 1911 to 1912 he
was assistant U. S. district attorney
o f the Eastern district, and from 1929
to 1935 he served as a member o f the
U. S. board o f tax appeals a fter having
been named to the post by President
Hoover. In 1938 he was an unsuccessful
candidate fo r the U. S
Senate on the Republican ticket.
On the board o f tax appeals, if the
senate approves o f them, will be
W illiam J. Conway, Wisconsin Rapids,
fo r six years; H arry Slater. Milwau
kee, two years; and D. L. Broadfoot,
Mondovi, four years.
Conway, a form er judge, is a mem
ber o f the present tax commission.
Slater is a Milwaukee attorney, •
form er Republican assemblyman and a
brother o f Assemblyman Ben Slater.
Broadfoot, who is 46 years old, is a
prominent Republican in Buffalo county
and has served as district attorney
o f that county.
Tax Bill Indefinite
There still is nothing definite about
the 1939-40 tax measure. The assembly
is expected to complete action this
week on the substitute bill sent to
them by the senate.
O riginally the assembly sent to the
senate a bill calling fo r a reenactment
o f the 60 per cent surtax, a two
cent cigarette U x , increased wine and
liquor taxes, and increased corporation
income taxes by proposing a general
6 per cent corporation tax.
The senate disagreed. It turned
down the liquor and wine tax, withdrew
the increased tax on corporations,
and substituted a hill calling
for highway diversion at the rate of
7H million fo r the biennium. C igarette
taxes and the 60 per cent reenactment
surtax remained in the bill. I t
also has a fight on its hands as to
whether or not the state would assume
the responsibility fo r 15 per cent o f
local relie f costs.
The tax bill must return to the senate
again. I f the senate fa ils to agree
with the assembly amendments this
time, the bill w ill be sent to a joint
reference committee.

Communication
A Short Course for an Old Teacher
Many teachers at the age o f sixty
sre interested in reading to their
classes “ The Christmas Carol” by
rVffcon*. rev iew irg heroic deeds o f
Washington and Lincoln, dressing
children in costumes used in other
countries, dramatizing “ book learning”
and givinsr expressions to their
knowledge o f the wavs and emotions
o f people in other lands through folk
d»nc°s. songs and instrumental music.
Old. or shall we sav. experienced
teacher® believe in having narent* and
community people v is it their classes
at apv time and come to these activities
often to see children • perform
“ book learning” and not to see children
at their desks filled w'ith fear lest by
a partial w rone answer, accordine to
the old nuestion and answer method,
the wrath o f the “ old teacher” might
be invoked. Evidentlv some teachers
arp mentallv much older than sixty
and have not kept abreast o f present
dav educational methods.
Book learning is being stressed
more than ever. In almost everv field
o f education m^re nnd better book«
are published, but, stranire to say. all
new books advocate activities. The drv
atmosphere o f the “ old teacher” is
lo«*t and children do not learn by force
and fo ar but hv a livin g spirit of
activities. Call it “ fan fare.” “ frills ”
or what p vo r you please: undoubtedly
thrcn “ old fashioned teachers” are
afraid to have visitors. Thev do not
know how to dramatize, make proiects
and program* from thc wonderful
“ book learning” .
Some people complain about the
weather even if it is an ideal day.
They love themselves and everything
else tastes sour. L ife must be terrible
for such people.
Congratulations to all communities
that employ teachers that are believers
in that community, and create
activities fo r young and old, so that
the children perform under supervi
sion and are not reasoning “ book
learning” the entire day fo r the pur
pose o f planning activities miles away
from parents and that “ old teacher”

Sincerely.

Senator Met W ith Progressives
Senator Robert M. La Follette, Jr.,
Wisconsin’s senior representative in
the U. S. Senate, conferred last week
with Progressive leaders of Shawano
county during a motor trip through
the county.
On his w ay from Waupaca to Shawano
on Saturday he had an informal
conference with Wittenberg Progressives.
A regrettable mistake was
made when cards were sent out from
Shawano to a number of people giving
the impression that Sen. La Follette
was scheduled fo r a speech at K ersten’s
hall. A s a result of the notice,
several men and women were disappointed
when they came to the hall
and learned that such was not the
case.
The purpose o f the informal conferences
was to swap ideas and information
on the m ajor state, national,
and international issues.
The Senator told his Shawano county
associates that he was determined
to do everything in his power to prevent
the involvement of the United
States in the European war.
Pointing to the great fight his fa ther,
the late Rob* i t M. La Follette,
made to prevent American entry in the
last World W ar, Senator La Follette
said that he too would judge every
question laid before the Senate on the
single criterion o f whether it tended
to involve the American people in
European violence and bloodshed.
He maintained that American entrance
in the w ar would seriously endanger
our democracy and the Am erican
w ay o f life and would bring economic
chaos in ita wake.
A rtificial wartime booms would be
followed by complete collapse o f world
economy. Senator La Follette pointed
out, and the rank and file o f the nation,
the farm ers, the wage-earners,
the small business men and professional
men— the very group which will
furnish its sons to die on foreign
battlefields— w ill pay and pay dearly
fo r the tremendous cost o f modern
warfare.

Capitol Notes
By only a one vote margin the state
assembly killed a joint resolution
which would have proposed to amend
the state constitution so as to limit
regular legislative sessions to six
months. The present legislature is in
its ninth month.
When Governor H eil’s new ninemember
university board o f regents
came before the senate fo r confirmation
the senate approved all but one
o f them, Judge A. C. Backus. Next
day Senator McDermid asked that the
votfc disapproving Backus’s appointment
be reconsidered. Senator Coakley
objected, said there was no precedent
for such action. The presiding
officer took the matter under advisement.
Governor Heil has signed a bill
which abolishes the directorships of
the tax, public service and mental
hygiene departments. A secretary
from civil service rolls will be chosen
to head the public service commission,
while the mental hygiene department
as a separate unit is abolished and its
functions are returned to the board of
control.

Use More E lectricity
Wisconsin residents are using more
electricity and paying less per kilowatt
hour for it than the average customer
in the United Suites, a public service
commission bulletin shows.
Home use o f electricity for the past
four years has jumped about 26 per
cent, with users paying an average of
only 3.52 cents per kilowatt hour compared
to a national average of 4.15
cents. Energy cost in Wisconsin has
decreased 2.2 per cent since the first
o f the year while the national figure
show.s a decrease o f only 1.2 per cent.
Despite the decreased cost of energy,
utilities have benefited during the
first six months o f 1939 over 1938 because
o f increased consumption and
more favorable water conditions which
resulted in savings in the cost o f coal.
During the first half o f this year operating
revenues fo r the 10 largest utilities
increased 4.1 per cent while total
revenue deductions were increasing
only 1.6 per cent.
The commission explained that the
conclusions were based on records of
the eight largest electric utilities in
the state which make 86 per cent of
the total electric sales to ultimate consumers
in the state.

Rooster or Coop, Sir?
C. C. Peterson has just completed a
new chicken coop. As he was putting
on the finishing touches, he was surprised
to find the new hen house occupied—
and not by one of The Chosen
but by a neighbor’s hen. Recognizing
the color and breed, our honest friend
returned the fowl to the Martin Carlson
farm about half a mile away, but
lo and behold! when Mr. Peterson
reached his home, “ Henny Carlson”
had arrived ahead o f him and was
chuckling contentedly in the new coop.
This time Mr. Carlson came over to
Peterson’s to claim his own, and Dame
Hen was hustled back to the Carlson
farm. But next morning, when Mr.
Peterson came out to his chicken coop,
he discovered that the persistent
creature was back again. “ Henny1
Carlson was in full occupation o f the
new hen houee. What is the attraction,
Mr. Peterson? Is it entirely the new
coop, sir?

Beauty Under a Tent—
We wonder how many W ittenbergers
have visited our greenhouse lately
(w e are very lucky and proud to have
o n e !)— if any haven’t, we would urge
you to go down without delay to see a
strange, most beautiful sight. Under
a huge tent o f cotton gau tc grow
hundreds o f the loveliest o f asters
deep pink, snowy white, and a royal
blue. They stand waist high and
higher, tall and handsome. The handsomest
thing for the pocket book is
their prices! Now mind, we haven’t
been asked to advertise the Green
House in our column. W e dare say no
one w ill he more surprised to see these
words than Mr. ami Mrs. Hanson, but
loving flowers ourselves, we would
pass on two tips to other flower
lovers:
1. Hundreds of gorgeous asters
under a tent are a sight worth seeing
2. A lartre bouquet of asters in one’s
home is a g ift worth having, and these
are so reasonable they seem a g ift!
Gentlemen, here is your chance to
bring your wives and mothers a hit of
joy at very little cost. I t ’s too good U>
miss!
And speaking about beauty in Wit
tenberg. We look with pleasure and
pride on the well tended lawa. trim
shrubs and flow er beds in Washington
Park. How often wo have watched
Mr. Berbaum with love and infinite
care plant and tend to the flow ers.1
W ittenberg owes Mr. B'-rhaum a
heartfelt ‘Thank You’ for the faithful.
loving work he has put in on the
park.
The whole business section has had
“ its face lifted ” so to speak, by the
improved condition of the lot between
Turecek’s and A r s o n ’s stores this
summer. The mere fact that the grass
has been kept cut has reflected fa vo rably
on the whole appearance of the
business section. There are a number
o f other eyesores down town that need
considerable attention before we can
point to our town as a town where
“ civic pride” is evident and public
spiritedness reigns supreme! We
think it could be done— if individuals
would cooperate.

class “ C” district basketball tournament
be held at W ittenberg next
spring. Because o f its spacious new
gym and its cent ral location in respect
to the small high schools o f this district
it is likely that the request will
be granted.
Music Groups Organize
Mr. Born called the first meeting of
the hand on Monday o f this week and
fifty students responded. About an
equal number o f high school girls met
with Miss Enger on Tuesday fo r first
glee club meeting. The band w ill meet
from 3:30 to 4:15 on Monday. Wednesday
and Friday, while the Glee clubs
will meet at the same hour on Tuesday
and Thursday.

Rehearsal Tim e Is Here Again
Eleven seniors le ft the band this
spring, and surely we will miss them
I'rontlv. but many new members have
taken their places and fifty members
are ready to attack new overtures,
exercises, and marches. Most o f the
new members have had less than four
months o f training and nearly all
eleven graduates had played four
vears in the band. Such members as
Marcella Bloecher, George Leo Voelz.
M arjorie Hitzke, Arlene Black. John
I .arson, Ray Oestreich. Bernhard A n derson.
Lois s.Tohnson, Violet Iverson,
Dorothy Plesser, Marilyn Maack. and
Ed. Sell, are now veteran members.
E very program contains music, and
the study of music Requires just as
much thinking ability as any other
subject.
The band appreciated the fine cooperation
and morale backing the
community in general showed last
school year and are sincerely hoping
fo r a repetition this coming year.

“ Widow M aker”
He l l o e v e r y b o d y :
W illiam PeU egrinetti of C hicago comes to bat today with
a yarn about a place w here tree stumps grow on trees.
You know, at first glance a fellow would be liable to say that
a tree is a natural place for a tree stump to grow . I ought to
explain that these stumps didn't grow down at the bottom of
said trees, where they w ere supposed to. N o—you found them
hanging in branches o f other trees— trees they didn't even belong
to.
The fellow s had a name for those dangling stumps. B ill Pellegrin
etti w ill tell you about that later. But now let’ s get on
with the story of how B ill won the reputation of being a man of
iron nerve.
B ill says he doesn't deserve that reputation at all. It's true,
1 he stood his ground when death cam e bounding toward him —
but B ill says he stood there for a totally different reason from
; the one the other fellow s attributed to his action. It was in
August, 1933, that it happened, and Bill was a m em ber o f a CCC
) outfit in a cam p twenty-three m iles from the town of M eham a,
Oregon.
Th ey w ere building a mountain road, and B ill explains
j that the road builders worked in three crews. The fir s t gang
to follow up the m arkings m ade by the surveyors w ere the
timber fellers. Th ey went up the line cutting down all the trees that
stood in the way of the road.
Then follow ed the dynam iters, who blasted all the stumps and roots
out o f the ground. A fter the dynam iters cam e the laborers.
C rew Ordered to L a y Small. Tem p orary Bridges.
B ill was w-ith the laborers. H e was with a crew whose job it was
to la y sm all, tem porary bridges o ver all the mountain stream s that the
road crossed. And now, before we go any farth er, w e ll let B ill him self
take the floor and tell us about those tree stumps.
"W h en the bla ster, w ere dynam iting the stumps,” he says,
“ la rg e parts of them flew into the air. Often stumps, with the
roots still on them , flew great distances, and becam e lodged in
the tops of standing trees. W e railed those hanging stumps
‘ w idow -m akers’ and they w ere rightfully named. F or a slight
breeze would often dislodge thrm , and when they cam e crashing
down, it was very bad luck to be on the spot they picked to
land on.”
It was one o f those w idow -m akers that started all the trouble for
B ill. Th ey w ere laying a cedar log foundation for one of the bridges
they had to build when all of a sudden things began to happen.
Th e stream they w ere bridging ran through the bottom of a deep
gully. T h e mountains rose sharply above them and the trees, at that

one tree, standing by itself, with one o f those large stumps sw aym g from
its upper branches.
It was about three feet in diam eter, and parts of its roots
w r f still sticking nut like the tentacles of an octopus. Nobody
paid any attention to it until, suddenly, as the boys w ere working
busily aw ay at their bridge foundation, they heard a loud crackling
noise above them.
“ W idow M aker” Crashes Down Through Branches.
It w as the stump— crashing down through the branches. Once It hit
the ground it would com e hurtling down that slope at express-train speed.
And it w as right above the spot w here that crew was working One
o f the men yelled, “ W id ow -m aker!” And im m ediately every one in the
crow d started m aking fo r shelter.
Th at is, everybody started m aking for shelter but Bill Pelleg
rin e tti!
H e w as absorbed in his job and didn't see the stump coming until
he heard the first man cry out. Then he looked up just in tim e to see
the stump m ake its first bounce.
“ It cam e down that slope,” he says, "ga in in g momentum
with e v ery fraction of a second. It bounded in enormous leaps,
straight toward me. F or a moment it fascinated me. Then, I
tried to run and found to m y horror that I couldn’t. I couldn’t
m ove a m u scle!”
A fterw a rd , Bin's pals called it cool nerve. Th ey told other
fellow s in the cam p how he stood still, never flinching, while
that grea t stump cam e hurtling right at him. But B ill says it
w asn't nerve at all. In fact, it was just the opposite of nerve.
B ill w as scared stiff.
“ It kept right on com in g,” he says, "lookin g b igger at every bounce
it took. Somehow those long spidery roots shooting out from its sides
looked like arm s reaching out to grab me.
" I t all happened in a fe w brief seconds, but in that time a m illion
thoughts raced through m y mind. A lread y I was figuring that I w as a
goner. I wondered what people would say about m e, and recalled sm all
incidents, long since forgotten, about m y patents and other m em bers
o f m y fam ily.
The Hurtling Stump Was Taking Its Last Bounce.
"S om e folks say that when you’re faced with death you think of
all the evil things you’ve done in the course of your lifetim e. M aybe I
had never done anything rea lly evil.
" A t any rate, all my thoughts in that long, ageless moment w ere of
m y home and loved ones. I realized, then, how much I wanted to live.
But up ahead of m e that hurtling stump was taking its last bound before
it would reach m e ."
That stump was high in the air, and coming down again
straight at B ill, when all of a sudden, he snapped out of it.
In that instant the power of motion cam e back to him. He
flung him self down and to one side with the speed of lightning.
And as he fell, he could hear the stump whistling by in the very
spot where, a second before, his head had been.
The fellow s all said that B ill stood his ground and dodged that
stump like a bull fighter would dodge a bull. Only B ill knew that he
stood there because he sim ply couldn't m ove from the spot.
"N o w , when things go w rong,” he says, " I recall that picture of the
■widow-maker’ bearing down on me. I rem em b er all the things I thought
I w as leaving, and how much I wanted not to lea ve them. Then I say
to m yself, ‘B ill, you dope, you 're not so bad off a fter a ll.’ ”

Captain Carl Norwood has been sent from

Captain C arl Norw ood was in nothing
y et that he or anyone could recognize
as trouble. On horseback,
follow ed by a mounted native orderly,
he was entering the ancient gate
o f Kadur City. A good-looking fellow,
young to be a Captain of R oyal
Engineers. He looked m ore like a
cavalrym an . Inside the city gates,
there w as a stinking herd of loaded
cam els. They blocked the street.
N orw ood’s horse that wasn’ t used
to cam els went into a panic. When
he had calm ed the horse he dismounted,
gave the reins to the orderly,
and told him to let the horse
get used to the sm ell of cam els and
follow as soon as the cam els w ere
out of the w ay. He wanted to
stretch his legs anyhow. It was only
a m ile w alk to the Residency, on the
fa r side of the city. Th e sw arm ing
streets w ere interesting, just before
sunset, with the night life just beginning.
The R esidency stood in a vast
compound amid neem trees. Guardhouse—
flagpole— Union Jack. The
Residency guard o f native Indian infan
try was turning out to pay the
custom ary honors to the flag at sunset.
The Resident was on the front
steps, m iddle-aged and m ilitary
looking. N orwood had to w ait until
the b rie f cerem ony was over. His
reception was not cordial. The invitation
to dinner was perfunctory,
so phrased that it was easy to refuse.
“ I ’m tired, sir. Long march. I
would like to turn in e a rly .”
“ V ery w ell, Captain Norwood.
Don’t let m e inconvenience you. I
was informed, of course, that you
w ere coming. Can’ t say that I approve
of this survey of the Kadur
R iv er. The priests w ill resent it bitterly.
Th ere nray be trouble enough
as it is over the tem ple boundary
dispute. The M aharajah claim s ownership
of certain buildings, beneath
which it has been an open secret for
centuries that the priests have a diamond
m ine.”
“ Th at’s w hy I ’m here, *ir. I was
told that P rin ce Rundhia started
the argum ent.”
“ Yes, he’s heir to the throne. He
had to start it in the M aharajah’s
pam e. but it waa Rundhia s idea.
Th e M aharajah is a quiet old gentlem
an, thank heaven. No initiative.
Satisfied to let things take
their course. I believe the quarrel
would settle itself, if w e would let
it alone. Th e diamond mine is one
of those open secrets that do no
harm until they’ re aired by busybodies.
Th e arrangem ent has
worked perfectly w ell all these
years. Th e priests don’t win many
diamonds from the mine. Som etim es
years go by without their finding any
stones worth putting on the market.
But they m ake an occasional find.
Th ey turn over a certain percentage
to the M aharajah, and sell the rem
ainder for tem ple revenue.
“ Yes. T h ere’s a rum or the mine
is dangerous.”
“ Good God, m an! Th ey don’ t let
anyone near the m ine— not everr the
M a h a ra ja h !”
“ Provision has been m ade for
that, s ir.”
The Resident squirmed. “ W ell,
take ca re that your— ” he selected
a w ord; he used it tartly: “ —spies
don’t m ake trouble.”
Norwood returned to the city. The
new street lights had been turned
on. T h ere was a sw arm of homing
traffic — bullock carts, cam els,
droves o f pedestrians, scandalously
noisy and decrepit autos. Norwood
stood on a sort of traffic island in
m id-street— an oasis of palm s with
an ancient fountain and one big glaring
arc-light. H e could see the orderly
bringing the horses; he m ight
just as w ell w ait for them.
Th reading its w ay through the

take the air. It was m agnificently
horsed. Tw o mounted men
rode ahead to clear the w ay, and
they w ere followed by two runners
arm ed with sticks. Tw o men in
splendid liv e ry on the box. Tw o
footm en on a platform behind the
ca rriage. T w o m ore horsemen
bringing up the rear.
As the ca rriag e drew near N orwood,
a terrifica lly noisy truck
frightened the horses. Alm ost at
the sam e moment, two elephants
loom ed into view from a side street.
Th e horses plunged. The d river had
hard work to control them. Th e ca rriage
swayed violently. Th e right
front wheel struck the curb, close
to N orwood. The shock jerked open
the door. The electric arc-light
shone in, revealin g the occupants.
The coachman reined the horses to
a standstill, shouting to the footmen
to seize their neaas.
Diamonds, pearls, zephyry silken
saris o f the hue of H im alayan dawn.
Tw o women. The older, stout one
raised a fan to hide her face. It
was the other who held Norwood
spellbound.
She w as young. She was full of
laughter. She had mocking, excita ble,
generous eyes that looked wild
to lose their innocence and rev el in
w hat shouldn’ t be, but is, and is
amusing. She saw no evil, only
humor in being stared at by a man
who shouldn’t see her, and hadn’t
expected to. Indian zenana ladies
are supposed to shrink from m en’s
eyes. Hers m et Norwood’ s full, and
full o f laughter.
N orwood, of course, recovered
self-possession. He was in uniform,
so he saluted. He was about to
speak; he had thought of a properly
gallant rem ark that would sound a lmost
like a quotation from the “ A ra bian
N ights.’ ’ when the palace servants
took the situation in hand.
•T h e d riv er recovered command of
his horses. The ca rria g e m oved
on. The footmen jumped up behind.
Norwood was left wondering.
He had had a vision. He had never
seen such a beautiful girl.
Th e older, stouter woman, who
had used the fan to hide her face,
should be the Maharanee of Kadur.
But Norwood knew she was childless;
otherw ise P rin ce Rundhia, the
M aharajah’s nephew, would not be
heir to the throne. The ladies of
Kadur have black, not golden hair.
so the younger g irl could hardly be
a relative. She m ight be a princess
on a visit from some northern Indian
State.
The orderly, selected because he
was a native of Kadur, rode up with
the led horse.
“ Has P rin ce Rundhia taken a
w ife ? ” Norw ood asked him.
“ No, sahib.” One does not discuss
zenana ladies—not with men
of an alien race. Th e orderly grinned
him self into the kind of silence that
suggests the subject is forbidden.
N orwood rode back to his cam p,
w here Moses L a fa yette O ’L ea ry
lied, like three men of three d ifferent
races, about who had drunk
the whiskey.
“ It was an em ergen cy,” said
O ’ Leary. “ Y es. sir, I took the liberty.
But how can I get inform ation
if I m ayn ’t count on your knowledge
o ’ m y honesty, and take a
chance now and then on your o verlooking
what would be impudence
if someone else should do it? I have
to treat m y informants decent. H ave
you heard who’ s staying at the palace?
T h ere’s a guesthouse in the
garden full o’ women. Am ericans.
Tw o. A young one. And an aunt
who’d fill a hotel. Truck-loads o ’
luggage. I ’ ve heard say the aunt
could m ake a brace of tigers wish
th ey’d looked the other w ay. They
say she’s a holy terror. But they
tell m e the young one ’ud m elt your
heart to look at her. Th ey call the
young one Miss Lynn H arding.”
“ What else have you found out?”
“ Not m uch.”
“ Y ou ’re about due for an Irish
promotion. Y ou ’re getting too fat.
I ’ve m y ey e on a man who knows
what w ork is.”
“ A ll right, sir. I f you want m e
to talk before I know what I ’m talking
about, I ’ll do it. Here goes.
Th e whole bazaar’s as full o ’ dirty
rumors as Stoddart’s dog is o’ fleas.
T h ere’s a gam e on, and it’s all set.
T h ey ’re laying for us, and the w ay
they figure it w e’ re in the bag already.
I ’ve been offered a bribe to

“ Cash?”
“ No. Prom ises. Man name o’
N oor M ahlam .”
“ Beyond that you w ere offered a
bribe, did you get any other line
on their intentions?”
“ No. I know w e ’re being spied
on. T h ere’s a saying in Kadur that
diamonds see in the dark. W e're
being watched now. We can’t afford
a mistake. But they’ll try some

“ Don’t take their money. Don’t

“ M e ? ”
“ Y es. Y ou .”

M rs. Deborah Harding, in le g gings,
a short skirt, and a w ide pith
helmet, w earing goggles, and with a
cam era suspended somehow from
her portly figure, prodded ruins with
the ferru le of a green silk sunshade.
Tw o palace servants danced attendance
on her, doing their obsequious
utmost to prevent calam ity.
“ Sahiba! N ot good! Much too
many cobra—kerait— scorpions— too
bad. Come, look this way. Plenty
ruins this w a y .”
But Mrs. Deborah Harding w asn’t
in the habit of taking the advice of
anyone less than a Supreme Court
Justice; nor would she hesitate to
question that if it didn’t agree with
her own convictions. She was dynamic,
opulent, w illful dignity personified.
As honorary special co rrespondent
to The Woman Citizen, of
Aaronville, Clarendon County, Ohio,
she was being an authority on ruins.
She looked like authority. She had
authoritative gestures, and a notebook.
It was close on sunset. Mrs. D eborah
H arding's goggles w ere dusty.
Th e blood-red sunrays confused her
vision. She was one of those people
who always believe what they see
but nothing that they don’t see. She
saw a cobra. She did not see that
the stone, on which she set her foot,
was loose, curved on its under side
and resting insecurely on a flat rock.
So she twisted her ankle and sat
down— hard. It jolted every bone in
her corpulent body.
Tw o hundred and eight pounds of
widow with bankers’ references and
one hundred per cent opinions, can
sit down harder than a crate o f
groceries.
“ I never saw such people—such
a country. I have travelled all
around the world from A m erica. I
have visited numbers of countries.
I have not seen your equals anyw
here for inefficiency and lack of
human intelligence. What shall I
do now? I am in pain. H ave you
no ideas? C an’t you suggest something?”
One of them mounted the pony
and cantered aw ay for assistance.

herself and making im potently

The cantering servant ^rew rein j
at an outlying police kana and, a fter •
a heatedly uncom plimentary debate I
with the policem an in charge, \
phoned the palace. The Maharanee j
was out. It entered no one s head to j
consult the M aharajah; it was hia j
hour o f the day to study postage
stamps, so he was incommunicado, r
except to the physician who should j
bring him his evening tonic. How- :

that afternoon, from a visit to Delhi, j
Someone phoned him. Things happened.
Th ere are two palaces. Rundhia’s

only by a high w all and two widths
o f glorious garden. Rundhia’s im- i
ported patent automatic garage-door
swung open. His imported ex-Czarist
chauffeur w hirled a Rolls-Royce
to the front door. Rundhia took
the wheel. Th ey opened the front
gate just in time. Another split
second and he would have crashed
it, sacked the lot of them, and j
bummed a new ca r from his aunt.
Th ere was a w hirl of dust, a din
of tooting. Headlights flooded the
narrow roads with blinding glare. |
Th ree dogs and som e belated chick- !
ens died the death. Th ree villages
gasped and called on thirty gods to
witness their piety. Rundhia
ram m ed on the brakes and got out
of the car to bow to Mrs. Harding
just as ca lm ly, as blandly, as amusedly
courteous as if he w ere entering
her draw ing room.
“ Well, I am glad to see you ,'’
said Mrs. Deborah Harding. “ I don’t
know who you are, but— ”
“ P rin ce Rundhia, your host’s
nephew.”
“ How d ’you do. You took your

TRUTH about ADVERTISING
By CHARLES B. ROTH
An accumulation of rubbish near

Ashes, falling from the shovel, can

MEMORY COURSE
THE G erm an psychologist, Ebbinghaus,
a careful, scholarly observer
o f the workings o f the human
mind, has said that w e fo rg e t 90
per cent o f what w e learn within
24 hours. F rom your own experience
you know that what he says is
true.
The business man, noting this, understands
why he must advertise,
not occasionally nor sporadically,
but all the tim e. I t ’s the only w ay
he can be o f the greatest se rvice to
his customers.
His advertising reminds us o f him
and o f the things he sells, and
though w e m ay forget
him and those
t h i n g s between
times, every a dvertisement
he publishes
renews the
im pression and creates
recognition of
his business.
His problem is to
find the m ost econom
ical w ay o f reminding
us that it is
to our advantage to
trade with him.
He discovers soon that nothing is
so econom ical a m edium for this
purpose as the newspaper Th ere
he advertises. We read. Both he
and ourselves benefit by his repeated
advertising.
He benefits in the obvious #a>,
by winning -is as steady customers.
We benefit .u equally obvious

to m ake our lives m ore interesting
and com plete.
A dvertisin g Is the news of business.
O ften that news is o f fa r m ore
im portance to us than any other
news in the paper.
F o r exam ple, if a w om an needs
a new coat and scans the a dvertisements
to see what is being offered,
the business news she reads is of
fa r grea te r moment in her life right
then than the story on page one of
a w ar in A sia Minor or o f an oil

Stripped o f all glam or and m ystery

Th e a d vertiser uho keeps telling
the story o f his ad\antages naturally
gets the bulk ol the trade, because,
as you have just learned, w e

continually if w e are to act.

a long enough time, the nam e o f the

pan. w ill speedily sm other flames,
cutting off necessary oxygen. MR. L. D. G R E E N
Many people here w ill be interested
in the experience o f Mr. L. D. Green,
25 Fifth street. Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.
He says he suffered stomach gras
and bloat, and some foods lay on his
stomach like a heavy load. He found
ready re litf in Williams Formula, and
wants to tell others about it.
He says he can eat many foods
now and is grateful fo r the opportunity
to endorse such a fine medicine
as Williams Formula.
Williams Formula is a pure, powerful
medicine containing valuable
herbs and other ingredients which
start to work in a few minutes to
help relieve burning acid stomach
pains. It stimulates muscle action in
the intestines, and acts as a tonic la xative
to relieve sick headaches or that
loggy feeling and dizziness caused by
constipation. A mild diuretic on the
kidneys. Helps build up the quality
of iron-poor blood. Get a bottle of
Williams Formula T O D A Y at Maack's
Drug Store. A $1.50 bottle o f this
poweiful concentrated, taken in water,
makes a F U L L G A L L O N o f medicine,
therefore, it is economical to take.

I t ’s not a long step from horse-farming
to power-farming w ith the John
Deere. Farm boys hardly old enough
to drive three horses operate this
tractor. And it doesn’t require a mechanic to keep
it in good running order. Y o u can do it yourself,
right out on your farm.
The John Deere gives you everything you want
in a tractor for your heavy farm jobs— adaptability,
jnm-er, economy, light U'etght, simplicity, and accessibility
. I t supplies drawbar, belt, and power takeo
ff scrvice to reduce your labor costs, to do your
w o rk when it should be done, to give you more time
for other duties or for recreation.
Investigate the John Deere fully. Ask any one
you know who owns one. Come in and let us show
you why the new model is better than ever.

P O E T W AS ONCE A L A W Y E R
O E A D this story of the conventional
la w y er who becam e one
o f our m ost fam ous poets. N ot a
dream ing, unsuccessful law yer, but
a m an with a profitable and im portant
law practice, important enough
to associate w ith Clarence D arrow
at one time. A busy man of com m
erce who becam e a w riter of
songs and poems, sonnets, essays
and dram a!
E d gar L e e Masters was born in
the little town o f Garnett, Kan., in
1868. His father was a descendant
o f old V irgin ia stock; his m other,
the daughter of a Methodist m inister
and descendant of Israel Putnam of
A m erican Revolutionary fam e. The
fa m ily m oved to Petersburg, 111.,
and later to Lew istow n, where Edg
a r was raised in the typically respectable
atm osphere of sm all town
A m erica.
H e did newspaper work fo r the
local w eekly, learned the printing
trade, and studied law under his
father, who w as one of the leading
la w yers in the state. In 1891 Edg
a r L e e M asters was adm itted to
the bar and practiced in partnership
with his father. The follow ing yea r
ht opened his own office in Chicago
w here he was a highly successful
la w y er until 1920.
But even in high school, E dgar
L e e M asters w as interested in w riting
and he n ever forgot his am bitions.
H e contributed to the Wa*
ve rly M agazine of Boston and the
Saturday Evening Call of P e oria ; he
w rote poems fo r a Chicago newspaper.
His first book, published in
1898, while he w as struggling to establish
a practice in Chicago, was
called sim ply “ A Book of V erses.”
“ Songs and Sonnets” followed, but
none of them attracted much attention
until his “ Spoon R iv er Anth
ology” w as published in 1915. Poem
s, stories ana philosophy follow
ed rapidly.
Those of you who lam ent your
unexciting lives and yearn for opportunity,
look at his dual personality,
the poet who has won such
h:*h awards in the realm s of literature.

Desserts Th at A r e
D ifferent
Build up your menu to an interesting
clim ax with a new and delicious
dessert!
Desserts really play an important
part in the menu, and in nutrition,
too
Sweets, provided in proper
amounts and in the proper place in
the diet, are just as necessary to
good nutrition as m ilk, meat, fruits,
vegetables and cereals.
Plan the dessert to fit the menu—a
light sweet for the close of a hearty
dinner, and a richer, h eavier dessert
to wind up the m eal that is
fa irly simple. Consider the weather,
too, and when it’s hot and humid,
serve sweets that are temptingly
dainty. When the tem perature drops
and appetites perk up accordingly,
desserts m ay be sweeter, richer and
m ore substantial.
Y ou ’ll find in this collection of
tested recipes from m y own kitchen
a dessert for almost any occasion.

U. S. Already Discusses Peace
Allies Will Impose on Germany
In Event Hitler Is Vanquished
(EDITOR’S NOTE—When opinions are expr«M»#ed in theae column*, they

West wall: *'We won’t shoot if you
don’t.”
But there was good evidence that
this evident lack of hostilities appeared
only on paper. The lid of
censorship clamped down over both
France and Britain, screening what
the French war office called “ contacts”
on the western front. All
three m ajor powers were evidently
reluctant to invite revenge by bombing
London, Paris and Berlin, yet
the Germans admitted British bombers
had attacked their fleet at Wilhelmshaven.
T H E W A R :
Good Start
*7 rrgret that after 2,000 yran of mankind,
Sunday mttrning should find tha
prime minister in the pitsition of announcing
that men are on the eve of lit inn like
beasts."
Such were the sentiments of John
McGovern, leader of parliam ent’s
independent labor party. His was
the lone dissent that fateful morning
when Neville Chamberlain, his
peace efforts at a hopeless end, declared
war on Germany. A few
hours later France followed suit and
by nightfall most of the British empire
was also in line. By that time
the rest t>f the world clamored to
declare its neutrality.
Too busy was Neville Chamberlain
to notice that Barbara Hutton
Reventlow fled the romantic isle of
Capri, or that American radio sponsors
were about to complain over
too many program interruptions for
CBS and NBC news bulletins. Nor
did he notice that thousands of London's
pet dogs and cats were pain-

A fine Sunday morning.
lessly exterminated lest they prove
a burden during evacuation. Said
one weeping pet owner: “ I t ’s a
d am n shame. It ought to be Hitler
on the end of this leash.”
Such was the man-on-the-street’s
background for war. Since 1936 he
had accepted its inevitability, yet
the awful reality of legalized brute
force somehow left Itim benumbed.
He watched without passion as B ritain’s
popular Winston Churchill and
Anthony Eden—both foes of appeasement
— were given cabinet
posts to solidify public sentiment.
He slowly built a halo around the
head of Prime Minister Chamberlain,
whose frantic umbrella waving
of the past two years had at least
postponed the war. He may have
wept over the news that French
troops marched to the front “ almost
tenderly,” hating war yet fervent
in their ambition to “ smash
H itler and all that he represents.”
But as such things happen, B ritish
and French men-on-the-street
were whipped into war frenzy the
next morning. Steaming to Montreal,
the liner Athenia was torpedoed
off Ireland with 1,450 refugee
passengers aboard, providing
enough provocation to make even
the “ tender” French soldiers hate
Germans in general as well as Der
Fuehrer. Paris and London heard
Polish civilians wrere suffering
“ frightfully” as Adolf Hitler headed
for the eastern front and the first
m ajo r battle, just getting underway
in Upper Silesia.
After two days of “ fighting,” the
World war of 1939 had developed
into a decidedly unorthodox conflict.
British warplanes flew over Nuremberg
but dropped nothing heavier
than propaganda leaflets urging the
G erm an people to discard Der
Fuehrer. Nazi anti-aircraft guns
failed to bark back. The same day
French soldiers on the Maginot line
were reported to have set placards
atop their pillboxes, carrying this
message to German soldiers in the
Chronology
These were the events and dales that
led to uar in 1939:
AVGUST 21 — German-Soviet
non-aggression pact announced,
day after trade pact is signed.
AUGUST 23 — Hitler expands
demands on Poland, which are
refused.
AUGUST 27 — Hitler outlines
policy to French Premier D aladier.
AUGUST 28 — Britain stands
firm on negotiation for all points.
AUGUST 29 30 — Notes exchanged,
but peace dwindles.
AUGUST 31 — Hitler invades
Poland without declaring war.
S E PT EM B E R 1—France, B ritain
send ultimatums, demanding
Germany withdraw troops from
Poland.
S E PT EM B E R 3—Receiving no
answer, Britain declares war at
11 a. m., France following qt 5
p. m.
Where arul How?
If France and Britain had any cut
and dried plan for rushing aid to
their beleaguered ally, Poland, they
took their time executing it. Best
guesses held both democracies were
stymied, not only by Hitler but by
the silence of other key nations.
Germ any’s West wall and France's
Maginot line apparently made the
western front a bulwark of staticism.
Both other routes of getting
to Poland were perilous:
Via the Baltic. Though British battleships
blockaded that sea, a Baltic
expedition would be no pushover.
Troop and supply ships must fight
the Reich’s famous and pestiferous
submarines, must hold their breath
against cunningly placed mines, and
m ust land at Gdynia (Poland’s only
port) which might be in German
hands by that time. Landing
against an enemy has always been
a m ajo r m ilitary problem, and already
the Polish corridor has been
nipped by German troops. Not only

in the Baltic and might decide to
join the R e ich ’s cause.
Via the Mediterranean. Strangely
silent as war opened were both of
H itler's erstwhile continental
friends, Spain and Italy. The allies
hoped H itler's sell-out to Russian
C om m unism would keep Spain’s
Francisco Franco and Ita ly ’s Benito
Mussolini out of the conflict, but no
one could tell despite Spain's neutrality
proclamation and Italy's resumption
of sea traffic. With Mediterranean
neutrality, French-British
aid to Poland might go through the
Mediterranean and Black seas, land
at R u m a n ia ’s port of Constanta and
thence reach Warsaw. But Rum ania,
like all Balkan countries, was intent
on neutrality.
At Home
In the U. S., which has w'atched
Europe’s wars for almost 200 years,
observers were far enough from the
forest to see the trees. Though
President Roosevelt pointed out no
American has the “ moral right” to
capitalize on the conflict, every
economist knew it would probably
start a boom. “ Cash-and-carry”
neutrality would make the U. S.
support B ritain and France, which
dominate the seas, opening new
markets for farm products and
steel. But such a neutrality would
also accentuate the already marked
P O L I T I C S :
Neutrality
Well remembered in Washington
is the hot Ju ly night F ranklin Roosevelt
called the senate foreign relations
committee into his White
House Oval room, discovered he
had insufficient votes to force a
change in the present neutrality
law, and sent the senators away
with acknowledgement that full responsibility
for the “ failure” rested
on their shoulders.
Even better remembered is the
August day at Hyde Park when
Franklin Roosevelt tiraded against
an adjourned congress, pointing out
it had made two enormous “ bets” :
( 1 ) that his lend-spend bill was needless
because private enterprise
could do the job alone; (2 ) that no
neutrality revision was needed, because
there would be no war in
Europe before next January when
congress meets again.
By September 1, four months before
the next normal session, the
President m ight have boasted that
congress had already lost one bet.
There was war in Europe (See Column
One), which gave Mr. Roosevelt
and Secretary of State Cordell
A N T H O N Y E D E N
Winston Churchill also came.
U. S. sentiment against Hitler, confounding
isolationists by making the
nation a virtual silent ally of the
allies. Should enough American
non-combatants be killed via torpedoes,
the flame of 1916 and 1917
might again blot out reason. Hence
the President urged the U. S. to
weigh its facts with care.
The End?
Next to neutrality, the most moot
question among Americans concerns
the eventual end of hostilities.
No longer does anyone but a fanatical
anti-German see justice in the
Versailles treaty of 20 years ago,
which wrung lifeblood from the
Reich and placed it in such dire
straits that a Hitler was welcomed
with open arms. But will Versailles
be repeated?
Unless Russia jum ps to Germ
an y ’s aid, unless Mussolini and
Franco junk their apparent neutrality,
a war to the end would probably
find Germany collapsing under
economic stress. Hitler No. 1 would
be vanquished, but can anything
short of another “ peace without honor”
(such as Woodrow Wilson suggested)
keep a Hitler No. 2 from
rising out of the ruins?
K E Y PITTMAN
But does the public agree?
Hull a severe headache. Under the
present neutrality law, they had no
alternative but to declare an embargo
on “ implements of war” for
belligerents. Just as good a neutrality,
in the eyes of Messrs. Roosevelt,
Hull and Sen. Key Pittman,
chairman of the senate committee,
is the “ cash-and-carry” variety under
which any belligerent able to
reach a U. S. port could buy ,and
carry off all the “ implements of
w ar” he wanted.
Not at all impossible as war broke
out was the special congressional
session Mr. Roosevelt has long
threatened in such an eventuality.
But if he thought congress would
give him a free hand, indeed, if he
thought this free hand might help
h im keep the U. S. out of war and
thus pave the way for a third term
in 1940, he was badly mistaken.
Gallup polls of public sentiment
found such an assumption wrong on
two counts:
(1) Last April a Gallup poll
showed 57 per cent favoring a
change in neutrality. By early September
it had dropped to 50 per
cent, indicating the nation was less
and less sure that the administration
is right.
(2) Also in early September, another
poll showed 71 per cent favored
a special congressional session
in case of war. comments revealing
that the public would feel
“ safer” that way. Whether this
sentiment discredited the President’s
ability, constituted a vote of
confidence in his rebellious congress,
neither, or both, was anybody’s
guess.
Em phatically minus political im port,
however, were the steps Mr.
Roosevelt took. Clamped down im mediately
was the arms embargo.
Confiscated were the passports of
all Americans returning from E u rope,
while the state department
terminated all U. S. tourist travel
to the continent. Belatedly came the
official proclamation of American
neutrality. Next day the navy department
pondered the advisability
of assigning naval convoys to merchantmen
transporting U. S. citizens
from war zones. At the same
time Attorney General Frank Murphy
began seeking ways to tighten
statutes regulating profiteering during
war time. Still to come were
new farm policies to deal with the
new situation, though an advisory
council was being formed.

A S I A :
About Face
Most embarrassed by Russia's
non-aggression treaty with Adolf
Hitler were Communists in other
lands, who talked themselves silly
trying to justify their new bedfellow,
socialism. Second greatest em barrassment
fell to Japan, which only
a few weeks ago was busy insulting
U. S., British and French interests
in the Orient. Confident of her anti-
Commitern pact with Italy and Germany,
still more confident after she
signed a trade treaty with Germany,
Tokyo suddenly found herself friendless
when the Reich adopted Comrade
Stalin.
Highly nervous was the Japanese
press as European hostilities got
underway. While war planes continued
to bomb Chungking in an effort
to close the Chinese war
promptly, the Tokyo cabinet sat in
extraordinary session.
“Splendid isolation” was the advice
of Tokyo newspapers, but there
was good evidence Ja pa n was w illing
to turn about and woo for
democracies’ friendship.
WASHINGTON.—The whole course
of United States relations with Ja p a n
may be changed as a result of the
about face of the Hitler and Stalin
governments. When congress adjourned
Secretary of State Cordell
Hull had already served the necessary
six-months notice of abrogation
of our commercial treaty
with Ja p a n . Not only was this action
highly popular in the country,
to judge from comments at the time,
but it was approved on Capitol Hill
by almost every faction and group
of congress—from the vigorous partisans
of B ritain and France to the
most extreme pacifists and isolationists.
Not only that, but it was obvious
that if congress had stayed in session
much longer there would have
been serious attempts, which might
have proved successful if given the
slightest encouragement by the administration,
to take further steps
against Ja p a n . This move might
not have gone as far as was advocated
by Sen. Key Pittm an , chairm
an of the senate foreign relations
committee, who wanted an outright
embargo against Nippon, but it
might have approached it.
Obviously President Roosevelt,
seeing that his first move against
Ja p a n had been so popular, might at
any time have declared that he recognized
that a state of war existed
between Ja p a n and China. This
would have meant, under the present
neutrality law, that this country
could no longer ship “ arms, am m u nition
and implements of w a r” to
Ja pa n. The only reason this is not
in effect today is that Ja p a n has
never declared war, and because of
fear that such an embargo might
hurt China more than Ja p a n this
government has never officially recognized
that war in the Orient exists.
Obviously, also, congress was set
to take some step in this direction
when it reconvenes, either in
Ja n u ary at the regular session, or
earlier if the President should call
a special session.
O p p o s it io n to C lo s in g
T r a d e D o o r ft i t h C h in a
This feeling, which has been widespread
in the country, has been
based on two factors. First, there
is very general sympathy in the
United States with China as against
the aggressions of Ja p a n . But second,
Ja pa n has been the ally of
Germ any and Italy, and as such has
been disliked by all partisans of the
“ democracies.” Up to the Hitler-
S talin pact this dislike was shared
by the Communist element in this
country also. In fact Ja p a n simply
did not have any friends in this
country, and had hosts of enemies,
whose feelings had been fanned by
the various incidents, including the
sinking of the gunboat Panay, and
outrages on civilians.
B u t now the whole situation has
been changed. There is no evidence
that there is any friendlier feeling
for Ja pa n. Certainly there is no
more sympathy with her aspirations
to subjugate and govern eastern China.
And there is certainly just as
m uch violent opposition to her closing
the door to United States trade
with China.
But Ja p a n is no longer the probable
adversary of B ritain and
France in a World w a r—a war into
which the United States m igh t easily
be drawn. So she is—for the
time being certainly—no longer a
possible enemy of the United States
in open warfare in the pending
emergency.
Many astute observers have long
felt that war between Ja p a n and
the United States is inevitable eventually.
That may or m ay not still
be true, but in the present situation
it is not a factor to be considered.
Ja pa n has already, since the
announcement of the Stalin-Hitler
pact, given evidence of a desire to
plaoate Britain. Naturally she does
not like the thought of Germ any’s
giving the Soviet a free hand in
the Orient. Having obtained what,
according to Gen. W. G. Krivitsky
and other observers, Stalin has
w anted for a long tim e—a tieup with
H itler—Stalin may easily decide
now to slap down Ja p a n in her attempts
to overrun China and encroach
on territory that Stalin desires.
P o u r e d W a te r o n W h e e ls
O f th e Is o la tio n is t B lo c
Curiously enough the Stalin-Hitler
agreement poured a lot of water on
the wheels of the isolationist bloc.
They are not doing much screaming
from the housetops about it, yet,
but they are studying it quietly,
gathering ammunition for their own
battle with the White House and
state department in the event that
congress is called back to Washington
and the heat turned on to get
rid of that embargo provision for
“ arms, am m unition and implements
of w ar.”
If the Stalin-Hitler pact proves to
be only temporary, the isolationists
will argue that it’s fair warning of
the danger of monkeying in power
politics. If the pact proves to be
durable as well as logical, producing
peace by winning for the dictators
just what they want without
war, they will argue that Roosevelt’s
effort to define neutrality as a policy
of preventing war is superfluous.
The immediate reaction in Washington
to H itler’s coup is chagrin
that the blind spot in a policy of
defending democracy wherever it is
attacked was so quickly and brutally
exposed—reliance on participation
in this policy of a dictatorship
generally included verbally in the
list of “ democracies.”
Of course this inclusion of the Soviet
among “ democracies” has always
been a laugh to everybody
except the so-called liberals. U nless
one is for wie Soviet lock, stock
and barrel, one is not apt to consider
Russia under its present government
as anything but a dictatorship.
Most people in this country
do not approve either the Hitler or
the Stalin methods of government.
In fact the dissenting majority, who
always wondered why the Soviet
was called a democracy, have also
been hard put to it mentally to understand
just why those in this
country who favor the Soviet have
been so bitter against the Nazis,
and why those who favor the Nazis
are so bitter against the Com m unists.
l l a n l to F ig u r e D iffe re n c e
B e tw e e n S t a lin a n d H it le r
If one eliminates the fact that
the Stalin government has never
been excited about what race a p articular
person springs from (not
what religion, because both Stalin
and Hitler have been rather tough
on all religions) whereas the Nazis
have no use for Jews, Negroes, or
in fact any non-Aryans, the difference
between the two governments
is a bit hard to figure out.
So perhaps it should not have been
such a blow to certain observers,
including the United States state department,
that the Stalin and Hitler
governments have been getting together,
despite the utmost efforts of
Britain and France to bring the Soviet
into their alliance against H itler.
However, all these developments
are making it more difficult for the
President to get what he wants on
neutrality legislation. They are cited
as demonstration of the instability
of the promises ot European governments;
as proofs that the United
States will do well to keep out altogether.
R e e d s P o o r B u sine ss a n d
A S u bm is s iv e Congress
Whatever critics of the New Deal,
in or outside of business, may figure
about what a boom between now
and next Janu ary w'ould mean politically
to Franklin D. Roosevelt and
the New Deal, it is a very real question
to the President.
The problem is that it is not a
simple question. To attain his m ax im
um strength from now until November,
1940, Roosevelt should have
very poor business from now until
January, then an utterly submissive
congress to vote all the appropriations
for government spending that
Roosevelt may want early next
spring, and finally a very real revival
of business during next sum mer
and fall.
The bad business from now until
Janu ary is necessary in order to
frighten congress into giving Roosevelt
his own way when the law m akers
meet again. It is also necessary
to prove to the country that
Roosevelt knows much better than
congress what is needed. Besides,
it is necessary in order to put the
would-be budget balancers and economy-
minded group headed by Sen.
H arry Flood Byrd of Virginia, Sen.
Josiah W. Bailey of North Carolina,
Walter F. George of Georgia, Alva
B. Adams of Colorado, etc., in their
places.
The good business that is necessary
to the m ax im um Roosevelt
strength after the new appropriations
are made by a submissive congress
next Ja n u ary is essential to
provide good times so that the country
will be satisfied with the New
Deal when it goes to the polls in
November, 1940, to elect a new' President,
and will vote either for Roosevelt
himself, for another term, or
for some candidate Roosevelt has
picked.
P re s id e n t B e lie v e s th e
O l d D o c tr in e S t i l l W o rk s
It is perfectly true that m an y of
the New Dealers know little of practical
politics, and do not agree with
the doctrine that there must be good
times if the party in power is to be
retained by the voters. But Roosevelt
is no tyro in politics. He knows
his way around pretty well, and
there is very little doubt among political
observers that the President
believes the old doctrine still works.
They point to the condition which
was allowed to prevail during the
summer and early fall of 1936. The
administration so tempered the wind
to the shorn lam b during that period,
and for a few months prior to
it, that the country had a mild
boom. A great many business men
decided that the Roosevelt adm inistration
was not so bad for their
own profits— the only thing that influences
any business m an in the
conduct of his business and political
operations—as the Republican ora-

By G R A C E A R C IIB O L D
«• V O U are a very naughty boy,”
* said Mrs. Wilson to her little
son, as she looked with dismay at
the mutilated magazine she had
just taken from him . “ If Donald
were not on his way to tea with you,
I would put him off and punish you
severely. You know this magazine
belongs to his mother and was only
lent to us. I shall have to explain
to her, and what will she think? It
is not easy to get another copy.
Run away, I am out of patience with
you,” she added, flushed and greatly
annoyed.
It was an unhappy and sullen child
that slipped oil to his playroom.
A little later a ring of the bell
announced the arrival of the visitors,
Mrs. Macgregor and her son
Donald. The boy was carrying a
large parcel and looking very happy
about it.
“ May I see Harry at once, Mrs.
Wilson? I have a present for h im /*
said Donald eagerly.
The two mothers listened for a
few moments, and excited exclamations
of joy soon reached their ears.
“ You look disturbed and worried.
I hope you are not in trouble,” said
Mrs. Macgregor.
“ Yes, I am . Sit down. I am so
glad you have come, though 1 did
think of putting you off, to punish
Harry for his naughtiness. First of
all I must confess to you about this
magazine of yours,” responded Mrs.
Wilson. “ I have just caught Harry
in the act of cutting the picture of
a dog out of it. I am so sorry.”
Mrs. Macgregor laughed. “ It does
not matter in the least. I wonder
what made him do it,” she added
thoughtfully.
"T hat is just what I should like to
know. It is not the first time he has
done that sort of thing. He has a
perfect passion for cutting out. The
strange thing about it is, that though
I have given him old magazines to
clip to his heart’s content he does
not confine himself to them. When
the impulse seizes h im he is liable
to cut from any paper or magazine
without any scruples whatever.
Only the other day, I found his sister
Ethel terribly upset. Harry had
cut the picture of a spaniel out of
the book her father gave her on her
birthday.”
Cutting No Idle Impulse.
“ That is bad. He must be taught
to respect other people’s property.
You said it w'as the picture of a
spaniel? Another dog? Is he fond
of dogs?”
“ Yes, he is devoted to them. Unfortunately,
we cannot let him have
one because we live in an apartment.
What can I do? A few days
ago I found a little collection of dog
pictures hidden away in one of his
own books.”
“ That is the explanation!” exclaimed
Mrs. Macgregor. " I t is not
a mere idle impulse, you see. He
cannot have a real dog, so he is
doing the best he can with pictures
of them. Why not help him to turn
his thwarted devotion into a scrapbook
hobby? As it happens, Donald
has brought him a large scrapbook
like his own. The very thing for
his dog pictures.”
Mrs. Wilson gave a sigh of relief.
" I like that idea,” she said. “ Harry
will love to fill his book with stories
and pictures of dogs. I ’m afraid I
haven’t been sufficiently sympathetic
with this urge of his. But of
course he must learn to restrain
himself when the pictures are in
books and magazines, especially
when they belong to other people.”
“ Certainly he must. Why not encourage
him to ‘take you to see’
each new dog before he appropriates
it? Show him that if it were a real
dog he would have to consult you.
Then you two can talk over Ihe possibilities.
If he may not have some
particular dog that he wants for
his scrapbook, explain the owner’s
rights and help him to find another
very much like it. Children are not
unreasonable. It will make a great
difference to him when he feels he
has your co-operation.
“ He could color the pictures realistically;
that will add to the interest.
He w’ill learn much from the
m aking of his book, and the mental
training will be invaluable.”
“ Yes, I ’m sure you’re right. Thank
you.” said Mrs. Wilson, smiling
gratefully.
