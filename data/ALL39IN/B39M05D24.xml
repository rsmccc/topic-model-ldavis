         <p>BLACK RIVER WINS
HONORS AT LA CROSSE
Honors were divided among high
schools at La Crosse Saturday where
27 bands of the district appeared in
concert and in the big parade and a
number of orchestras and glee clubs
competed 
Honors may have been divided but
we feel that a very generous share of
them were brought home by Black
River Falls Every one is more than
proud of the band orchestra and glee
club The reason is self evident Miss
Keefe and Mr Jorgenson were two
very appreciated people Saturday
night 
The band received first in march-
ing first in concert and second in
sight reading 
The orchestra received first in con-
cert and first in sight reading 
The girls glee club received second 
In addition the American Legion of
La Crosse awarded marching honors 
There were four awards Sparta was
first and Black River Falls second in
class A-B In the C-D class Blair re-
ceived first and Gays Mills second 
There were many Black River Falls
visitors who watched the parade
which took place in down town who
were more than proud of Wayne
Glennie our efficient drum major 
and his able lieutenant Howard Har-
alson Their work as leaders of the
band attracted plenty of attention 
Thousands were thrilled by the sight
of the marching bands 
Miss Keefes orchestra was invited
to play in the evening concert where
only outstanding numbers were on
the program but in view of the fact
that it would make it so late in re-
turning home the invitation was not
accepted However Erwin Peterson
was one of the early numbers on the
program playing a bass viol solo 
The school as well as many pa-
rents wish to express appreciation to
the many who kindly contributed
their cars and their time in transport-
ing students Among those who drove
there taking a number with them
were Mrs L D Anderson Rev H 
A Allison Ben Arnold Gust Berg 
Adolph Borufka Leslie Bowen Geo

P L MOE IN BUSINESS
HERE 58 YEARS
Seventy-nine years ago on March
28th twin sons were born on a farm
in Rendalen Norway to Lars and
Helen Peterson Life was not too easy
for them Their mothers health was
poor Their father lost his farm and
it was some time before he obtained
another One of those sons the one
in whom we are most interested 
started at the early age of ten years
to take care of himself He herded
cattle in the summer and worked do-
ing chores in the winter The years
passed by one by one and by-and-by
he was 20 years of age and an op-
portunity offered to go to America 
That waS in 1880 1716 man was
Peter L Moe veteran hardware mer-
chant of this city 
Young Peter had a place to come
to in the new land An aunt a sis-
ter on his fathers side was among
the early settlers here She was Mrs 
Jacob Hanson Her husband had ar-
rived in America as early as 1853
and had hewn out a home and farm
in Pine Grove He built a 16x20 log
house cleared the virgin timber and
started to farm His oldest daugh-
ter was the wife of the late Peter I 
Peterson parents of Mrs John Haug-
stad of this city He has one daughter
now living in Seattle Mrs Ida Foss 
Mr Hanson sent his wifes nephew
a ticket and on May 1 1880 he ar-
rived in Black River Falls owing his
uncle $48 00 for his ticket and with
ten cents in his pocket 
His early months in the new land
were not happy ones He did not
know the language he had no money
and he had no friends It was two
years later that he mustered enough
courage to send for his twin brother 
Henry Larson now a resident of
Wausau His only other brother 
Olaf Larson lives in Klamath Falls 
Oregon where he moved in 1889 for
his health 
The first winter in the new land
he obtained a job in the woods in
Clark county working for the late
W T Murray of this city then ex-
tensively engaged in lumbering in the
adjoining county The young man
had a job assisting the cook He sent
to Chicago for a book and during his
spare time had his nose buried in it 
studying Learning the new language 
the new ideas of the new land Peel-
ing potatoes frying fried cakes prop-
ped in front of this young man was
his book He attracted the attention
of his employer when he visited the
camp Apparently he saw a future
for the ambitious young newcomer 
The next year in May 1881 just a
year after arriving here he was of-
fered a position in the Jones Mur-
ray hardware store occupying the
same site as the present Moe hard-
ware business 
The hardware store now occupied
by P L Moe Company has been
in existence since the early 50s 
when it was owned by J V Wells 
The firm of Jones Murray was
formed October 21 1875 when they
succeeded Mr Wells and in turn
were succeeded by P L Moe Com-
pany in 1896 when Mr Moe bought
the interest of the late W T Mur-
ray The late R B Jones felt oblig-
ed to retire on account of failing
health although he retained his finan-
cial interest in the store He felt free
to turn the complete management of
the business over to the young man
who had proved so efficient and ob-
tained such a mastery of the business 
The same year 1896 he was mar-
ried in the fall to Miss Anna Jerm-
stad at Taylor She was a daughter
of the late Mr and Mrs Ole P Jerm-
stad among the early pioneers of that
section Her mother died January
16th this year at the age of 91
years Mr and Mrs Moe purchased
the home and lots of Rev Ronneberg 
consisting of a small one-story house 
The lot was 90x90 He paid $810
for it In 1905 he built on the same
location the fine home in the second
ward which they have since occupied 
Mr Moe has made a fine success
in his business The fact that he has
not bought a dollars worth of goods
in 40 years that he has not discount-
ed gives one a pretty good idea of the
manner in which he carries on his
operations His store built new in
1912 after the flood of 1911 stands
on the same location it has had for
better than 80 years Generations
have come and gone with that store
always in operation and Mr Moe 
since he has been in it has gained an
acquaintance throughout the county 
Few of the old timers and even the
new timers but what stop for a chat
with him about old times and to en-
joy a joke or twq He states that he
is going to work as long as he can 
and that is the thing for Mr Moe-to
do He is not of the retiring type 
however well he may have earned the
position which fits him to retire 
Moes store without his genial cour-
teous pleasant personality would not
seem the same to his host of old
friends They wish him years more
of work among them providing he
passes over the hard jobs to his able
sons 
Speaking of sons he has six Six
fine fellows not a one of whom he
has ever discounted a cent let alone
a dollar There is little question but
what those six sons are his pride and
his joy in spite of the fact that he
passes on the credit of their upbring-
ing to their mother Rollin Price 
Lawrence Philip Alvin and Oswald 
all were born in Black River Falls 
Four of them are in business here 
Rollin and Alvin in the hardware
store with their father Price and
Oswald in the Moe Clothing Company 
another well-known business house
here Rollin and Price each have a
fine home in the city Mr and Mrs 
Moe have taken great pride in educat-
ing their sons Lawrence is now in

Americas war dead But the traffic
war slaughter of the last five years
was greater than Americas loss of
life in all wars and the last 18
months saw more people killed in au-
tomobile accidents than America lost
in the 18 months of the World war 
The State Highway commission ap-
peals to motorists and pedestrians to
hold accidents in check this week end 
Avoid fast or careless driving allow
plenty of time for that trip and
stay off crowded streets and highways
whenever possible If you walk keep
to the left side of highways avoid
any walking on rural highways at
night 
As Wisconsin pays tribute to its
war dead dont fall a victim of the
traffic war the highway commission
urges

DISTRICT LIBRARY MEETING
DRAWS LARGE CROWD
Fifty-two librarians trustees and
library friends attended the annual
regional library meeting of this area
held at Black River Falls recently 
The conference was held in Arcadia
last year with 32 in attendance and
even greater interest was taken in it
this year It will be held in White-
hall next year the invitation of that
city to entertain the meeting being
accepted at the business meeting with
which the conference closed 
The visitors were welcomed by Mrs 
P W Dickey secretary of the local
library board The meeting was held
in the library which was closed for
the day to the usual library activi-
ties The program was opened after
Mrs Dickeys welcome by Miss Jen-
nie T Schrage of the Traveling Li-
brary Department of Madison with
a discussion of rural library service 
She stressed the fact that 800 000
persons in the state still have no local
library service of any kind She ex-
plained the Louisiana system of ser-
vice which she recently had an op-
portunity to study and suggested the
many possibilities of bookmobiles 
which bring service to rural patrons 
A representative of the WPA sup-
plemented Miss Schrages talk ex-
plaining what that organization can
do to aid libraries The district
WPA office at Menomonie will fur-
nish detailed information to any one
who desires it 
Mrs Winifred L Davis library vis-
itor then presented the subject of
Childrens books She discussed the
ways for giving better service with
the materials at hand with the li-
brarians present and advised ways of
improving juvenile collections to meet
present day needs 
Luncheon was served by members
of the Methodist Ladies Aid in the
church dining room during the noon
hour and an interesting musical pro-
gram was enjoyed There were selec-
tions by the string ensemble from
the high school under the direction
of Miss Verna Keefe and solos by
Joe Johnson Winnebago baritone 
with Miss Verna Carlson as accom-
panist 
After luncheon the visitors again
returned to the library where the af-
ternoon session opened with a ques-
tion box the discussion being led by
Miss Nellie Lees of Fountain City 
Both librarians and trustees freely
expressed themselves on such ques-
tions as extension of service beyond
municipal boundaries rental books 
attendance at board meetings pay for
apprentices etc 
The open forum was followed by
Miss Mary K Reelys review of re-
cent books Miss Reely is head of
the book selection department of the
library commission 
That this feature of the program is
always anticipated with much inter-
est is readily understood by any one
with a good fortune to hear Miss
Reely With a dozen or so strokes of
a verbal paint brush she makes a
word picture of a book that is out-
standing She leaves you not with
an overburden of detailed informa-
tion concerning a book but with an
appetite for more Book reviewing
is a gift and she is certainly endow-
ed with it She mentioned in particu-
lar the many fine biographies and
books of historical fiction now ap-
pearing and which are written so
that they have a wide appeal The
titles and comments may be learned
by inquiring at the library 
At the business meeting which clos-
ed the conference the final vote for
a name for it was the West Central
Library Conference Mrs Clara Lie-
berg of Wihtehall will act as chair-
man and hostess at the 1940 confer-
ence meeting in Whitehall Miss Er-
na Mathys was reelected secretary
and treasurer
The conference expressed its sym-
pathy for Miss Annie Wylie our li-
brarian who because of illness was
unable to act as hostess and the Madi-
son delegation called on her to take
the message of the meeting It also
extended its thanks to Mrs Jennie
White and to Mrs Harold Wike of
Melrose who acted in Miss Wylies
stead Miss Wylie deeply regretted
the fact that she was unable to of-
ficiate at the conference for which
she had made plans throughout the
year Much to the regret of her
many friends she has had to make a
brave fight again against a strepto-
coccic infection following a sore
throat She is slowly improving

WE HAVE A DEBT TO PAYÄî
Poppy Day May 27 is the symbol
of a solemn obligation we are pledged
to meet 
For the youth they gave and the
blood they gave 
For the strength that was our stay 
For every marked or nameless grave
On the steel-torn Flanders wayÄî
We who are whole of body and soul 
We have a debt to pay 
When we have justly given back
To the maimed body and bewildered
brain 
New strength and light and will to
take ones part
In the worlds work at field or desk
or mart 
When this old joy of living we restore
We shall have paid a little of our
score 
What do we owe How shall we
pay Ponder the lines above writ-
ten by Theodosia Garrison and pub-
lished in The American Legion Aux-
iliarys National News They are the

tals They will ask every one to put
on a poppy as an individual act of
tribute to those who gave their lives
in Americas defense and to contrib-
ute something toward the Legion and
Auxiliary work for the disabled vet-
erans and dependent families 
The poppies will be crepe paper
replicas of the wild poppies which
grew in such profusion along the bat-
tle front in trance More than ten
million of them have been made by

Marcella Gill Relyea
Today is Mothers Day I keep re-
membering that caustic remark which
appeared in Smoke Signals last week 
to the effect that Mother is spending
the week in her kitchen concocting
new and delicious foods to feed her
family when they assemble to honor
her on Sunday Personally my idea
of an ideal Mothers Day gift would
be a vacation with pay even if it
only lasted that one day Stockings
and candy and beautiful cards are
lovely remembrances for the Mothers
of yesterday whose families are
grown into self-reliance but young
mothers would appreciate even more
the luxury of just one day of freedom
from responsibilities of any sort That
is the sort of a gift the poorest fam-
ily could afford to give Mother and
in doing so they would gain a new
appreciation of just what her daily
job amounts to Being a Mother isnt
just a matter of preparing and
clearing up after three meals sweep-
ing the floor and making the beds It
is the one job on earth which calls
for 24 hour duty and no afternoons
off nor vacations 
It combines the careers of nurse-
maid diplomat cook teacher seam-
stress washerwoman financial wiz-
ard and psychologist to mention just
a few and it pays the lowest wages
on the scale if we measure the pay
in coin Mother in her kitchen may
be queen of her domain and have no
time clock to junch night and morn-
ing like the poor working girl but
the fact remains that she doesnt get
any Äútime offÄù So if you cant af-
ford a fine present next year give
her one that doesnt cost a cent but
one that she will look back on with
pleasure Give her a day in which she
can do just as she dam pleases and
not one that she prepares for all day
Saturday and cleans up after all day
Monday 
Father Day being just around the
corner lets not forget that he could
use a day off too Turn him loose
with a fishpole and a growth of
whiskers if his taste runs in that di-
rection If he comes home with a big
catch brag him to the skies but if
he arrives disconsolate feed him well
on his favorite dishes and brag him
up anyway!

KROZE KOLUM
How to Hear
If you will turn to the Bible the
second section the third book of the
section and read the first twenty-
four verses of the fourth chapter of
The Gospel according to Mark you
will there read of four kinds of hear-
ers They may be separated into two
general classes Äîthose who hear but
do not heed and those who hear and
hold because they both hear and
heed 
It would be both interesting and
instructive to analyze each of these
four kinds of hearers We would
pause and picture the wayside Äîand
the wayside hearer And todays
world is full of wayside hearers su-
perficial listeners who catch a bit of
truth as in a daze or dream who
never retain more than a hazy recol-
lection of what they have heard 
whose memory is faint and futile 
And the world has lots and lots of
shallow hearers today They hear
gladly even with enthusiasm gladly 
but not deeply Changeable people 
these are swept about by every wind
of doctrine or suggestion Too many
things to be interested in Äînothing
much to be concerned about or to
concentrate upon 
Nor can we overlook or forget the
thorn-choked hearer Fine mental
soil Stirred by profound emotions 
Sound principles and high ideals 
Loves the good and the true and the
beautiful Hates the wrong But he
is too busy too bothered too harass-
ed by things as they are Essentially
all right is his mind but already fill-
ed with too very many other things 
How many things we could write 
about the deceitfulness of riches and
about the cares of this world and
about the lusts of other things Some
day we will write about these things 
for no one of us lives a life free from
the entanglements of these very riches
and cares and lusts 
In our time especially we are be-
set with the thorns of doubt and the
rank weeds of superficial un-thought-
of philosophies and sophistires We
doubt our country We doubt our
friends We doubt our faith We
doubt God Himself and doubting
Him we doubt all It is an impossi-
bility to cultivate sound character in
doubt-infested soul-soil 
There is not much hope in our first
class of hearers Äîthese three we have
thus briefly suggested If any hope 
it much reside in the other group 
those who both hear and hold because
they both hear and heed They Äòbring
forth fruits said Jesus 
There is much to hear in our time 
Many speak many speak much they
speak endlessly They speak of them-
selves and of the others like to them-
selves They speak of their own
remedies for whatever it is they think
is the matter They speak of new
brands and types of religion They
speak of new brands and types of
economies They speak of new brands
and types of governmental oversights
and managements 
They speak of recovery by aggra-
vating the illnesses that already afflict
us They speak of reform by at-
tempting to destroy every sure found-
dation upon which the feet of men
have ever stood as they have reached
upward to bigger and better and high-
er and nobler things They speak of
progress by pushing us backward 
backward morally by the repudiation
of debt and currency backward mor-
ally by the urgings to narcotize our-
selves with doles and booze and what-
not backward economically by the
insistent destruction of values of
every sort of growing things of life
itself four-footed life thus far Äî
but who is to say when the order will
be given to cut off tens of millions of
human lives (for that is about all a
war would accomplish) so that there
may be more work and more food and
more money for the remainder It is
naught but the logical follow-up of
destroyed cotton destroyed cattle de-
stroyed values destroyed idealisms 
destroyed constitutional guarantees 
destroyed liberties destroyed hopes 
destroyed faith 
Yes yes there is plenty to hear 
How do we hear What does our
hearing get us What does our hear-
ing amount to Where are we at
And where do we go from here
Have you heard of governors and
senators and assemblymen and oth-
ers who follow presidents one hun-
dred percent God save us from hun-
dred percent followers For I say to
you soberly and solemnly that I
would not follow even the angel Gab-
riel himself if my own best judgment
told me he was not right I have no
time at all no sympathy at all no
vote at all for the leader who is an
unhearing unheeding unthinking 
partisan follower of some other lead-
er I do not propose to be such a
follower myself of any leader and
I want no such leaders to follow
either from choice or from necessity 
We need to take time to prepare
to hear I know ears are provided us 
and auditory apparatus is a natural
heritage Nevertheless it makes a
tremendous lot of difference who
speaks as to the weight and value of
what he says Know who it is that
speaks let his life and his works 
his Äòfruits as well as his voice speak 
and hear both life and voice Read the
author before you see the play Study
the libretto before you attend the
opera Familiarize yourself with the
history of the country before you tra-
vel there Know the man before you
support his program or his candidacy 
Prepare to hear by knowing who
speaks and out of what background
and from what constructive living of
life in this human world 
Take time to hear Dont half
hear Half truths are mightily dan-
gerous under any circumstances You
cant get information on the run You
have to take time to listen and then
some more time to think it through 
Time to hear the voice that speaks 
and then time to hear your own bet-
ter judgment comment upon that
which was spoken by the speaking
voice 
Hear with a purpose When you
listen listen with something definite
in mind Does this lecturer have
something upbuilding for me Does
this preacher have something I can
build into my everlasting character 
Äîsomething that will help me to be
a world-builder Does this candidate
have something that will help me and
that will help me to help all the
other millions caught in the same
whirlpool of events in which I strug-
gle Does this public servant have
a report to make of which I can ap-
prove or what could be done to im-
prove the affairs over which he has
charge A purpose in hearing listen
to learn listen to be informed lis-
ten to be convinced listen to be en-
listed listen with a purpose 
ÄúHeed what we hear!Äù That is the
important thing Do something about
it Not like a certain young man a
splendid youth I see him in the
trappings of a ruler with clean face
and clear eye and voice ringing with
eagerness and truth stand in the
presence of Jesus the Galilean And
that One who speaks as never man
spake said to him ÄúGo sell all that
thou hast and give to the poor Äù Does
he hear Of course for he stands
face to face with Jesus Äîclose Yes 
he hears But what is the answer
Thus far nineteen hundred years of
silence His failure was not in his
ears it was in his heart He had
ears to hear but he lacked the will
to heed 
 Is it so with us As to our citizen-
ship in this present world As to our
citizenship which is both for nor and
hereafter forever in heaven As to
our nation in this strange generation
Are our ears all right but the dif-
ficulty with our hearts that we will
not heed
ÄúHeed what ye hear!Äù Heed it well 
my friend And listen with increas-
ingly great care and thoughtfulness 
in this day of over-enthusiastic un-
der-scrupulous propaganda

PIONEER STRIP CROPPING
FEATURED WLW BROADCAST
Jacob Von Arx who wrote his re-
cord in Äúcurving bands of colorÄù
around the hills of his Minnesota
farm will be featured in a drama-
tized radio presentation over station
WLW Cincinnati on Saturday May
20 Howard P Gutgesell project con-
servationist for the Soil Conservation
Service here has announced 
The broadcast presented by profes-
sional studio actors will tell the Äúdra-
matic storyÄù of a Swiss immigrant
who began strip cropping his sloping
land 65 year sago-Äîlong before that
erosion control practice was gener-
ally known in America Gutgesell
said 
It will go on the air at 5 45 p m 
central standard time and may be
carried by several stations of the Mut-
ual Broadcasting System The script
was prepared by the regional infor-
mation section of the Soil Conserva-
tion Service in Milwaukee 
ÄúThe broadcast will be of special
interest to farmers in this locality
because it will tell of pioneering soil
conservation effortsÄù Gutgesell stat-
ed 
He added that Von Arxs system of
strip cropping was the first such sys-
tem laid out in the upper Mississippi
valley so far as Soil Conservation
Service technicians can determine 
The practice is now extensively used
by farmers in this area 
Von Arx modeled his farming prac-
tices after thos eemployed in his na-
tive land Switzerland Recently sur-
veys revealed that yields are much
higher and topsoil much thicker on
this farm than on neighboring land
planted to straight rows in rectangu-
lar field 
Though Jacob Von Arx died in
1912 his conservation farming prac-
tices have been carried on by his
descendants who now operate the
land Gutgesell said

At the beginning of the season it	
was agreed that the six lowest give
a dinner to the six highest so on Sat-
urday night they all went to Camp-
bell cafe where the winners were en-
tertained right royally by one of the
finest dinners ever put on a table 
Then the boys adjourned to the home
of Harry Hendrix where the six high
played the six low and the low fel-
lows won by a score of 703 to 490 
The score of each was as follows 
The winners Gibson Gile 195 Ed
Persson 148 Eric Erickson 113 Joe
Stiehl 105 Harry Hendrix 81 and O 
M Rickard 61 The losers O F Pet-
erson 133 R H Hamilton 118 C A 
Nolop 109 C J Johnson 59 Fred

The season has been most interest-
ing furnishing entertainment of that
kind all winter and they all hope to
be able to start again next fall 
John Stiehl came from Madison
last week for a couple of days of
trout fishing but all he got was a
good old-fashioned ducking He
caught hold of a big German Brown 
weight unknown but large enough so
that he thought it must have been
over five pounds In trying to land
it he got it near the shore when his
reel broke John jumped in to get the
fish when Mr Fish gave one last reef
and broke the line John by this time
was up to his neck in water and con-
sequently had to go home and change
his clothes But his dad who always
gets his fish hooked one and landed
him and he tipped the scales at five
pounds and measured 23 inches
long So the Stiehl family had fish
after all

defeated the city team 18-19 The
first inning the city team led 6-2 and

decided to get busy and in two inn-

HEAP TEPEE TALK
(By Smoke Signal Redcloud)
Lives there a man whose soul is so
dead that he takes no pride in his
surroundings and dumps tin cans and
rubbish along the highways 
My idea of a good patrolman is one
who does away with tire bruising and
pleasure jarring stones and rocks of
the highways and byways 
It just cant rain here in Jackson
county The thunderbirds seem to
follow only the Federal Highway 12
east from Tomah and County Trunk
ÄúOÄù east from Millston and north of
here they follow Highway 10 from
Fairchild east to Marshfield These
thunderbirds know a good highway
when they see one They shy away
from Highway 54 
The writer invited a friend () out
at our place for fishing Normally
there is always good fishing at ÄúOx-
bowÄù But I did not guarantee any
catch The evening was cold just
before one of the cold nights we had
a few days back This friend and a
pal of his failed to make a catch so
their host was a calloused fabricator
and was reckless with the truth and
even the sons took after their dad 
It just doesnt pay to invite any one
for fishing as it jeopardizes ones in-
tegrity 
The head of the reconstruction pro-
gram in Jackson county with his
chief engineer were out on an inspec-
tion tour last week Wednesday after-
noon The sky was steel blue with
not a cloud in sight The sun was
brassy yellow The heat waves were
shimmering from the ground up to
about two feet The ground was so
dry the sand over which the dump
trucks traveled flowed like water 
The chief official inquired of me when
it was going to rain I replied it
would rain the next day He asked
if I was sure I said Äúoh yesÄù He
said ÄúWell take your word for it 
so well know whether you speak the
truth or notÄù The next morning it
started to sprinkle rain drops about
five oclock It didnt last long But
it was rain same as a few pennies is
money alongside of a thousand doll-
ars A man is taking grave chances
forecasting rain during a drought 
but I thought I knew my weather-
signs Far sooner I would forecast
change of weather than prophesying
a catch of fish for any one Its
much safer 
Oh sure we should have a centen-
nial to celebrate the founding of
Black River Falls Wis a hundred
years ago So why put it off for an-
other year as some people suggest 
To drink hot coffee and enjoy it the
most drink it when its piping hot 
To put off the Centennial another
year is just like drinking hot coffee
after its cold No amount of cream
or sugar can make it taste like when
it was hot

MERLIN HULLS LETTER
The study of monopolies by the
special Senate committee has delved
into the subject from various angles
for months It has discovered much
that other investigations had already
revealed in recent years In a general
way its activities have not made front
page news in the press The subject
is old and the methods and practices
of combinations in restraint of trade
are quite common to nearly all of
them In most court actions the gov-
ernment has been successful The
law still stands in about the same
form as originally There is nothing
to prevent other actions being started
except the delay occasioned by the
department Were all the monopolies
which have been discovered to be
prosecuted the courts would be busy
for years to come Still the subject
is being seriously investigated to find
out what could and should be done
to monopolies 
The investigation now is about to
take another twist It will endeavor
to ascertain why bank reserves con-
tinue to pile up in the reserve centers
while unemployment continues farm
values and prices are still on the to-
boggan and industry works only part
time The reserve banks now have ov-
er four billions of dollars of excess re-
serves or nearly double the legal re-
quirement Bank deposits continue to
roll in while commercial and indus-
trial loans are not in such demand
as to stop the rolling 
For ten years endeavors have been
made to restore prosperity and now
the recovery seems to be impeded
by too much money in banks and not
enough of it working to provide em-
ployment and put business on the up-
turn It is a situation so unusual the
world over that experts with their
many differing reasons as always 
and apparently even the administra-
tion and the senators are anxious to
find out the wherefore and what to
do about it With proper deference
to the wise folks in finance they seem
unable to be at sea in the matter 
And if the Senate committee finds out
why excess reserves are becoming
more and more excessive what will
they do about it 
Another special committee selected
by the House is investigating another
phase of monopoly It is trying to
learn why milk is selling at 14 cents
per quart in Washington while states
like Wisconsin have rivers of the
white health building liquid selling at
less than two cents per quart It has
much to go on from other investiga-
tions into the same subject It may
discover to what extent the monopoly
of distribution is aided by so-
called regulation of health depart-
ments which many think are drawn
more for the protection of dairy com-
pany profits than for the protection
of public health The grand jury
which indicted 92 corporation and
public officials in Chicago came to
that conclusion and brought in the
indictments In fact the investigation
of monopolies by grand juries seems
to be more effective than legislative
inquiry 
The Navy department wants to
economize upon expenditures The
particular economy recommended was
the purchase of canned beef from Ar-
gentine for the naval forces It ex-
plained that canned beef from Ar-
gentine can be bought at 9 cents
per pound on which there is a tariff
duty of only six cents Good beef
raised on the farms of our own coun-
try costs 23 cents in cans 
But the House of Representatives
bucked It inserted an amendment in
the Navy bill prohibiting any of the
funds being used to purchase canned
beef from Argentine or any other
foreign country along the same lines
as the amendments attached on ap-
propriation bills ten years ago pro-
hibiting the purchase of oleomargar-
ine by government departments Un-
der the amendment the Navy will be
supplied with canned beef from our
own farms 
The president did not share in the
opinion of the House and desired that
the Senate kill the amendment To
that purpose he let out a blast
through the press insisting that
canned beef from Argentine was not
only cheaper but better than that
of our own country The protest from
the cattle raisers and many others has
been prompt in coming and telegrams
are pouring in upon the senators and
representatives accordingly The sen-
ate also opposes the Navys plan of
economizing by purchasing canned
beef from Argentine 
Speaking of meat importations in
competition with our own production 
it might be well to mention that last
year over one million head of foreign
cattle were brought into this country 
mainly from Canada in addition- to
90 million pounds of canned meat
from Argentine pork from Poland 
and much else Over eight million
foreign acres were used to raise that
beef and fit it for the markets of
this country But for such importa-
tion eight million of our own acres 
now under crop restriction might
have been given over to raising cat-
tle Furthermore cattle prices might
have been considerably higher but for
foreign competition Our farmers can-
not produce beef pay the freight 
costs of processing and putting the
canned product on the market for
only 9 cents per pound 
Eight million acres does not seem
to be a large acreage relative to our
total but that many acres added
150 000 000 bushels of wheat to our
surplus last year The government
has sold 100 000 000 bushels abroad
at a loss of $20 000 000 to reduce
the surplus That many acres in the
south produced four million bales of
cotton last year Now it is planned
to spend $75 000 000 on subsidies to
sell the surplus cotton at a loss to
foreign countries More cattle might
have reduced the surplus of wheat or
cotton 
COOPERATIVE NEWS
By Earl Hornril1
The first cooperative refinery in
the United States will be built at
Philipsburg Kansas by the Cooper-
ative Refinery Association a subsidi-
ary of Consumers Cooperative Asso-
ciation North Kansas City Mo A
70-mile gathering pipeline will be
built at the same time connecting th
refinery with oil fields in Rooks and
Ellis counties 
The building of the refinery and
pipeline costing $700 000 altogether 
will be completed within 100 working
days after work is started The plant
will use 3 000 barrels of crude oil
every 24 hours and will have a daily
output of 11 carloads of refined fuels
and three or four carloads of locomo-
tive fuel a day The refinery will
supply about 40 per cent of the re-
fined fuel needs of the 440 local
cooperatives that own Consumers Co-
operative Association 
The members of our local oil co-
ops have a direct interest and part
ownership in this new refinery and
pipeline through their wholesale lo-
cated at the Twin Cities Any prof-
its that are made in this refinery and
pipeline is prorated back to the
wholesales and they in turn prorate
it back to the local coops and hence
on down to the consumer 
Three bills have been introduced
in our Legislature which if passed
would have a very detrimental effect
upon the cooperatives of our state 
These bills would take away from
the state department of agriculture
and markets its authority to promote
cooperatives and would remove the
income tax exemption now enjoyed by
cooperatives The third bill would
repeal the act providing for the teach-
ing of cooperation in the public
schools 
All three bills were introduced by
a committee at the request of Mar-
keting Association Inc Milwaukee
a group of private middlemen All
three bills coincide with the first
three demands of a bulletin put out
recently by the Wisconsin Chamber
of Commerce Other demands in the
bulletin are that the College of Ag-
riculture and the county agents cease
to promote cooperatives 
Cooperation has become an import-
ant part of the economic life of our
state and nation and it is hoped that
our legislators will weigh the bills
carefully and consider the source
from which they originated and deal
them a death blow that will long be
remembered 
South America has about 90 mill-
ion head of cattle raised principally
for beef In Argentine beef is selling
from the ranges at from $2 50 to
$3 50 per hundred as compared with
prices three times as high in our own
markets This country has 66 million
head of cattle of which nearly one-

ing the meeting in an effort to bring
to the members a better understand
ing of their duties and responsibilities
as stockholders of the association

half are dairy stock On account of
the prevalence of the foot and mouth
disease in Argentine that country can
ship only canned meat to our mar-
kets It is easy to imagine what would
happen to our cattle raisers were the
State department to succeed in rais-
ing the embargo on fresh beef from
that country The freight rate on beef
is much lower from Argentine to our
seaboard cities than it is from Chi-
cago It is not likely that Congress
will raise the embargo The canned
beef episode seems to have demon-
strated what is the sentiment of the
country regarding importation of
foreign farm products at a time when
the government has a billion-dollar
loan on surpluses of our own

fine pitching of Ernie Rudolph the

sent home on the short end of a 7
to 1 score Rude set them down with
only four hits and 13 of them went
down by the strikeout route The
B R F boys played errorless ball
and at no time was there any doubt
in the minds of the fans as to the out-
come of the game Royce Hoard hit
one over the fence for a home run
as the highlight of the game 
Sunday May 21 the Merchants
met a strong club from Reedsburg
and beat them easily 8 to 3 Rudolph
pitched his usual fine ball and had
some exceptionally fine support H 
Eleven made a fine running catch
such as is seldom seen outside of big
league ball and Ward Randalls also
came up with a fine play that brought
the crowd to their feet He picked a
low line drive off his shoe tops for
one of the best fielding plays of the
day Dale Hauser led the Merchants
attack with a triple double single and
walk for a perfect day at bat There
were 9 strikeouts by E Rudolph 
This years team looks better than
any we have had in the last ten years
and deserves your support so lets
get behind them and go places

morial day afternoon at 2 30 Tues-
day May 30 Watch the B-J from
now on for all the writeups on the

A person generally trades a car off when it is no longer an asset to him but a
liability because of heavy repair costs This then means a used car dealer has
to completely check these cars over for resale market In order to do this he
must have complete equipment such as factory trained mechanics completely
equipped body shops complete stock room expert grease rack service and
also B LINE service After checking completely with the use of such equip-
ment a dealer can put his used cars on the market and easily give his written
guarantee for complete satisfaction 
A potential buyer must consider price as well as condition of the used car 
THEY WORK HAND IN HAND As a result if a person can get an O K used
car at rock bottom price he has a BARGAIN So then if a bargain is what you
are looking for come in and see our guaranteed O K used cars

Soil Program
On Thursday May 25th all town-

representative of the state office will
be here to instruct the reporters in
the procedure to be followed in
checking farm compliance under the

The checking of compliance is to
be done during the month of June in
order that a portion of the payments
may be made during the fall or early

much easier to be away from their
farm work during June than any
other month 
Second inspections will be made
during September or October in all
cases where the farmer expects to
carry out additional soil building
practices during the early fall months 
Farm reporters will use the regular
farm maps since the aerial maps have
not been completed for Jackson coun-
ty

giving them this thought in the form
of a poem 
To live as gently as I can 
To be no matter where a man 
To take what comes of good or ill 
To cling to faith and honor still 
To do the best and let that stand
The record of my brain and hand 
And then should failure come to me 
Still wprk and hope for victory!
To have no secret place where in
I stoop unseen to shame or sin 
To be the same when Im alone
As when my every deed is known 
To live undaunted unafraid
Of any step that I have made 
To be without pretense or sham 
Exactly what men think I am 
This is the last week of school and
consequently the last issue of the
school news Mr and Mrs Pauli and
the faculty wish to express their ap-
preciation for the splendid spirit and
cooperation shown at the picnic given
in their honor at the Hixton park last
Friday evening We especially wish
to thank the committee members who
were responsible for the success of
this very enjoyable event Over 90
people were seated at one long table
and enjoyed the many good things to
eat The balance of the evening was
spent reminiscing and planning for
future good time until gradually the
various cars left homeward each oc-
cupant feeling that it was an evening
well spent and thoroughly enjoyed by
all 
Many new faculty members will
greet the students of the Hixton High
school next fall on the opening day
of school The ÄúoutgoingÄù faculty
members have served in this com-
munity for five four three and
one years respectively There have
been many pleasant associations in
the years past and the outgoing facul-
ty wishes to leave you with this
thought in mind which is so ably ex-
pressed by Edgar A Guest 
Wouldnt this old world be better
If the folks we meet would say
ÄúI know something good about you!Äù
And then treat us just that way 
Wouldnt it be fine and dandy
If each handclasp warm and true
Carried with it this assurance 
ÄúI know something good about you!Äù
Wouldnt life be lots more happy 
If the good that in us all
Were the only things about us
That folks bothered to recall 
Wouldnt life be lots more happy
If we praised the good we see
For theres such a lot of goodness
In the worst of you and me 
Wouldnt it be nice to practice
That fine way of thinking too
You know something good about me!
I know something good about you!

WHERE SHALL YOU GO
When the day is long and dreary and
you need a bit of balm 
Just turn there in your Bible to the
twenty-seventh Psalm 
When your funds are low and youre
down and out 
Turn to Psalm thirty-seven and see
what its all about 
If people turn you down and unkind
they seem to be 
Read John the fifteenth chapter and
there I know youll see
A remedy for your troublesÄîIt did a
world of good for me 
If youre out of sorts in general go
to Hebrews chapter twelve 
Youll see your doubts will vanish 
when here you think and delve 
If your own way doesnt seem to
come in everything youd like 
The chapter three of James will cause
your doubts to take their flight 
And in the days when work is scarce
and everything goes wrong 
The hundred twenty-sixth Psalm will
give you a new song 
And last of all when men seem to fail
and your faith in man does fall
Just read First Corinthians chapter
thirteen and we know youll have it
all 
Now when you read this Book of
Books and youre wrestling with
your mind
Just keep on searching day by day
and all solutions you will find 
It was written as a guide for jour-
neymen who travel on Lifes way 
It will set you right and fix your
plight and give you comfort every
day 
Consult The BookÄîyour chartÄîyour
map It will fillÄîrefill your soul 
Put yourself There with the Master
For He has remote control
