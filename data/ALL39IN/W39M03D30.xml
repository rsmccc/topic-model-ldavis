State Road Aid
This week state aid in the amount of
$4,101,666 will be distributed to local
treasurers of towns, cities and villages.
The allotment has been certified
by the state highway commission
and represents the state’s annual contribution
to localities for the maintenance
of roads and streets.
Under the state law, these allotments
must be spent for improving
roads and for the removal of snow
from roads and streets which are open
for travel and which are not portions
of state or county trunk highway systems.
As one of several shares of state
highway dollars (collected by gasoline
taxes and auto license fees) which
are returned to the local communities,
the statutes provide how the allotments
are to be made. By law towns
and villages receive $50 per mile for
roads and streets within their limits,
cities under 10,000 population receive
$100 per mile, cities under 36,000 get
$200 per mile, cities under 150,000 get
$300 per mile and Milwaukee receives
$400 per mile. Shares sent out in
January were for reimbursement for
automobile personal property tax and
the Ju ly share will be for county
trunk allotments.
Seek to Increase Aid
With the announcement of allotments
for local roads and streets it is
significant to note that the legislature
is seriously considering a bill which
proposes to increase the state money
shares to the local governments.
Backed by the County Boards Association,
one of the most powerful I
and influential lobbying organizations,
the bill authored by Assemblymen
Nelson, Hipke and Hanson proposes
to raise county, town and village
shares from $50 to $65 per mile, cities
under 10,000 to $130 per mile, cities
under 36,000 to #260 per mile, cities
under 150,000 to $390 per mile and
cities over 150,000 to $520 per mile.
The bill has been engrossed by tve
assembly by a unanimous vote and
was sent to the committee on joint
finance where it received favorable
action and recommendation for passage.
A similar bill in the senate has
been favorably endorsed by the senate
committee on highways.
Seek 8«/i Million for Relief
After a two-day meeting in Madison
the Wisconsin County Boards Association
has asked that the state raise 8'4
million dollars for direct relief purposes
for the 18 month period beginning
Ju ly 1.
A. J. Thelen, secretary of the association,
said that present relief co*ts
are about a million dollars a month,
and tbat the stnte now pays only about
10 per cent of the cost. The association
asks that the state pay at least
50 per cent of relief costs.
The association opposed granting
the state emergency board power to
cut state aids 25 per cent when state
revenues fall and went on record
against the bill which would prohibit
all counties except Milwaukee county
from having auditors.
A resolution asking the state legislature
to study the Ohio sales tax
plan to raise funds for relief and also
reduce the general property tax was
adopted. The present property tax
was denounced as a “menace to economic
stability,” by Charles Nixon of
Vernon countv who introduced the
sales tax resolution. It has been previously
indicated that a sales tax
would meet the approval of local
government if it was enacted so as to
return part of the monies collected to
units and thus make way for the reduction
of property taxes.
Nonpartisan Elections Out
Wisconsin’s 1939 legislature, like
its predecessors, does not want any
nonpartisan elections of county officers.
The senate in killing a resolution
which proposed a referendum to
the people to amend the constitution
for this purpose, has disposed of, for
the remainder of this session, any attempt
to change the present set-up.
A resolution by Senators Brown.
White and Shearer was killed when
the senate, after a 16 to 16 vote on
advancing the bill to third reading, refused
to reconsider their action.
A bill which proposed this change
has been defeated in the assembly and
a similar bill introduced in the senate
was withdrawn by the author after
the decisive defeat of the assembly
bill.
Fear Trapping Bill
Fur trapping in Wisconsin would
be impossible if a bill now before the
assembly, prohibiting the use of traps
which do not either immediately kill
trapped animals or take them unhurt,

ground on March 17. The fire started
in the attic from a chimney blaze. Mr.

Homme Orphan Home Is
Exempt From Taxation
MA DISON— Although the statute in
ambiguous, it is the opinion of the
attorney general'* department that
♦he n a l and peraonal property of tbe
Homme Orphan Home in Wittenberg
is exempt from taxation under Wis-1
consin law, District Attorney James
H. Larson, of Shawano county, has
been informed in an official opinion.
The Home is owned by the United
Norwegian Lutheran Church of America,
a Minnesota corporation. Questions
arose when the Home purchased
additional property in Wittenberg,
Larson said.
Attorney General John E. Martin
pointed out that “ the legislature is in
session and if the opinion is not in accord
with the legislative will or intent,
the legislature may very easily put
the matter at rest by legislation with
respect thereto.”

Many Enjoy P la v Contest
Last Friday evening, with balmy
spring weather to tempt them from
their cozy fireaides, a goodly number
of Wittenberg citizens enjoyed a play
contest sponaored by the Band Mothera
in the High School gymnasium.
The program opme>d promptly at
eight o'clock with two selections played
by the mothers of the band members.
Their performance was hugely
enjoyed and warmly applauded. (You
see the audience was surprised to discover
that the Band Mothers could
play so well that one could tell what
the selections were!).
Representing the Homemakers Club,
the Mesdames S. Iverson, G. Anderson,
E. Sihk r and A. Maack gave an entertaining
comedy entitled, “ Between
Trains,” coached by Mrs. Sihler. The I
setting for the play was a suburban
station on a rainy night.
Th«- 4H Club gave a very cleVei |
little one act play, “ Be Home by Mid-j
night,” coached by Mr. Gauerke. The
cast of characters was as follows:
Mr. Jones ....................Byron Johnson
Mra. J o n e s ........................Joyce Timm
Paul, the son ..............Roland Zeinert
Mary, the daughter . .Eunice Brunner
Junior ......................... Donald Iverson
The Union Circle of the Methodist
Episcopal Church gave “Chocolate
Cream Wedding,” a farce abounding
in humor and clever lines. If the cast
had a corking time doing an excellent
job with “ make-up,” the audience had
a good time trying to recognize the
women and children through their
“blacking.” Mrs. Grover Meisner
coached the play which had the following
cast:

Wittenberg Outfights Marion High
Although Marion High was declared
the winner on points, the Wittenberg
boys had the edge in boxing at Marion
last Friday night. Because the local
team did not have fighters in three of
the required weight classes the show
started with the score Marion 6, Wittenberg
0. The final score was 13—9
in favor of Marion. The Wittenberg
boys who won their bouts were Howard
Timm, Merton Farmer and Orton
Lunde. Those holding their opponents
to a draw were James Ringstad, Norman
Johnson and Edward Thomson.
Luther Mason, Delphine Seefeldt and
Carl Voelz lost their decisions.
This first showing of the local boys
will give them and their coach, Mr.
Torbenson, confidence for a good showing
in their matches that will be arranged
after the spring holidays.

Notice to Village Voters
It has been rumored in Wittenberg,
that I did not attend the full session
of the County Board and that during
my absence the County Board raised
the assessment of this village. This
is a falsehood, as I was present at the
entire session of the Board and no
such action took place. This work is
done by the Director of Assessments
under the State Tax Commission.
I wish to further state that in holding
the office of Assemblyman, it in no
way intc rferes with my duties on the
County Board. The Attorney General
states that the two offices are entirely
compatible. In fact, twenty-eight
assemblymen and senators are at
present serving on their County
Boards. Paul Fuhrman held similar
positions; Mike Mack is at present
chairman of the Outagamie County
Board. It is highly desirous to have a
legislator on the County Board, as the
work of the Legislature and Board are
oft# n closely related.
Certainly every voter must understand
that the office of supervisor is
not a lucrative one, but at the request
of many membc rs of the Board, I am
seeking re-election. I do not understand
why malicious remarks like
some of the foregoing, should be made.
I am anxious to serve the Village of
Wittenberg to the best of my ability,
to the best advantage for Wittenberg,
and to the least expense to the taxpayers.
Signed, M. H. SCHLYTTER.

Russia Returns to Spotlight ,

Fish and an o ld grudge provide a crisis.
E D IT O R 'S N O T E— Whea opinions are
expressed ia these columns, they are those
of the news analyst, and not necessarily
of the newspaper.
In te rn a tio n a l
Since Russia was ignored at the
Munich conference last September,
the Soviet has withdrawn to its shell,
apparently content to fight internal
problems and let the rest of the
world flght Adolf Hitler. This action
was justified. France, Britain,
Italy and Germany ignored Moscow
in settling the Sudeten issue;
apparently Russia was not wanted
in Europe, and anyway Ja pa n was
barking at her vulnerable Asiatic
door.
But necessity sometimes makes
strange bedfellows. Though Comm
unism looks far more like Naziism
than Democracy, Russian-Germ
a n interests clash on two vital
points: (1) Hitler wants the Russian
Ukraine, a vast expanse of rich and
fertile land which now gives Russia
most of its oil, wheat, meat and
m ine ral; (2) Germ any’s ally in the
vengeful anti-Communist pact is J a pan.
and Ja p a n is Russia's most ancient
and bitter enemy.
Hence Russia has emerged on the
international front once fnore as a
direct aftermath of Germ any’*
Czechoslovakian seizure. Huge,
mysterious, of unknown strength,
the blundering nation whose army
collapsed amidst its last European
venture during the World war, finds
C A RO L AND G E O R G E
Britain'« foresight was short.
Itself threatened simultaneously on
both east and west:
West. Czechoslovakia’s fall brought
H itler part way to the Ukraine but
alien soil still stood as a barrier. To
cross the Russian frontier German
troops must pass through either Rum
a n ia or Poland. The latter natio
n’s hostility to the Reich has increased
since Prague's collapse because
Warsaw had good reason to
fear Germ any might annex the Free
City of Danzig and close the corridor
which is Poland’s only outlet to the
Baltic or any other sea. Moreover,
agitation for Germ an annexation of
L ith u an ia’s seaboard town of Mem
el, and for possible creation of a
protectorate over Lithuania itself,
would leave Poland surrounded on
three sides by Germany and her
satellites.
Discarding Poland as a path to the
Ukraine, Hitler has turned to R u m
a n ia which not only offers a corridor
to Russia but many choice spoils
besides. The groundwork for this
coup was laid last November after
King Carol, fearing Naziism, made
a desperate bargaining trip to London
in search of British-French
trade support. Though wined and
dined by King George ( f photo)
and other personages of British royalty
who a few years ago had ig nored
h im as a scapegrace, the R u m
an ian king found London unwilling
to play ball. P rim e Minister Neville
Chamberlain was too busy appeasing
Dictators H itler and Mussolini to
risk upsetting Europe's diplomatic
applecart with a trade agreement
that would discriminate against the
Beich.
E n route home Carol signed an
economic accord at Berlin, accepting
for safety’s sake a Nazi overlordship
he disliked. This was not
placed into effect until the Czech
coup, when Carol found German
troops pounding on his door. Today
Berlin controls more than half of
R um a n ia ’s exports (wheat and oil)
and imports (manufactured goods).
Once in Bucharest, it is but a short
hop to either the Ukraine or such
Balkan states as Bulgaria and Yugoslavia,
where the Master of Central
Europe has already made his
strength felt.
Though at first happy that Germ
an penetration was going eastward
instead of into Belgium or France,
Europe’s democracies have at last
realized their error. A month ago
I Germany was strong m ilitarily but
impotent economically, devoid of
foreign exchange and short of food.
! Today, with Czechoslovakia’s big
| gold reserve, with R um an ian wheat
and oil, the Reich is strong in all
ways, a far greater threat than the
empire of 1914.
For Russia, today’s situation is
more dangerous than last au tum n’s.
With Poland nipped out. the Reich
would control the Soviet's entire
western frontier, gradually eating
into the borderlands by undercover
penetration. It was not unexpected,
therefore, that Russia should follow
Britain and France in protesting the
Czech grab, becoming even more
alarmed over R um a n ia ’s economic
collapse. Since the U. S. has also
protested by diplomatic note and im position
of an additional 25 per cent
tariff on Germ an imports, the red
j bearded Soviet finds itself no longer
! isolated but drawn into virtual dip-
1 lomatic comradeship with the three
nations whose democratic political
' philosophies are farthest removed
j from its own.
East. Russo-Jap conflict dates in
modern history to the war which
ended with the treaty of Portsmouth
in 1905. Since then ambitious Japan
has jumped to the Asiatic mainland
and penetrated Manchukuo and
Mongolia, both of which front on
Russian Siberia. For at least six
years this clash of interests has occasioned
spasmodic border tussles,
most of which went unreported until
last summer's Chankufeng hill incident.
The simple fact is that slowmoving,
stubborn Russians always
were and always will be at odds
with Japan's attitude of selfrighteousness.
Asia is not big enough
for both.
Last December 31 the fishing
rights Ja p a n has enjoyed in Siberian
waters since 1905 expired. Russia
refused to renew them and Tokyo
now plans to send its huge floating
canneries into Russian waters during
early April, protected by worships
As the crisis approaches, both
governments are rushing troops to
the Siberian-Manchukuoan frontier
where most Oriental observers confidently
predict a war must eventually
break out.
Significance. European and Asiatic
crises are related, insofar as (1) J a pan
and Germany have a virtual
military alliance, and (2) Russia is
involved in both disputes. Moreover,
Ja p aggression the past year has followed
amazingly close behind European
dictator coups, as when Canton
was captured after Munich, and
Hainan island was occupied after
Barcelona fell. Thus Jap-Italo-Germ
an parallel action has already
been evidenced. With huge
Russia emerging as the unexpected
focal point, today’s tense situation
encircles the world, involving more
nations than any period since the
World war’s heyday.

A g ric u ltu re
Time was when last year’s pric«
had little effect on this year's crop
Since AAA, however, Americar
farmers have realized the folly of
heaping insult on injury by adding
new surpluses to already swollen
granaries. Lack of export market
and heavy production last year sent
U. S. farm surpluses to a new high.
The expected result, now verified by
the department of agriculture's crop
reporting board, will be a general
cut in this season’s production of
most products.
Most outstanding fact of the survey
is that grain farmers will slash
17 per cent from their spring wheat
planting, yet total 1939 wheat acreage
is expected to exceed the AAA’s
announced goal by nearly 11,000,000
bushels. Total winter and spring
wheat prospects are for 65,678,000
acres.
Official explanation for the decline:
(1) efforts to conform with the soil
conservation program; (2) reaction
ments to changing feed requireto
last year’s decline; (3) adjustments,
necessitated by last year’s
surpluses.

Mexico
Last year Mexico's President Lazaro
Cardenas chased U. S. and
British oil companies out of the
country and seized their properties.
A big enough problem in itself, expropriation
loomed still more im portant
in the light of U. S. efforts
to solidify the Americas against foreign
economic intervention. Meanwhile
Mexico made hay by selling
its ill-gotten oil to Germany while
Pan-American nerves neared the
breaking point.
Like other American nations
which have tried barter trade agreements
with the Reich. Mexico soon
discovered she was unable to use
the manufactured items Germany
offered in lieu of cash. Seizing the
opportunity, victimized oil companies
sent Donald Richberg, attorney
and former “ brain truster'' to make
peace with Senor Cardenas.
Richberg terms: Control of the
properties should be returned to the
companies long enough for them to
break even on all past and present
investments. Then the property
would revert to Mexico.
Cardenas te rm s : Co-operative
Mexican-company'operation of the
oil properties, with U. S. and British
firms to invest new cash for their
development. But Mexico would
m aintain complete control over the
industry.
After two weeks of consultation
brought no solution, Mr. Richber|
returned home, promising to come
back late in April. Hardly had he
left, however, before President Cardenas
announced his own final
terms before 40,000 cheering workers.
Mexico will keep the wells,
paying indemnification with oil taken
from them.

Though a Slovak, and although
Hitler has made Slovaks independent
of Czechs, Col. Hurban
has so much dislike for Germany
and Hungary, and
so much pride in
the late Czecho-
S l o v a k n a tio n ,
that he refused to
surrender t h e
Czech legation in
Washington to the
G erman ambas
sador. Born in
the Carpathian
mountains, h e
knew Magyar oppression
as a
child. Becoming
a soldier, he went to Russia 30
years ago to accept a professorship
in the czar's war college.
When the World war broke out
he and 70.000 other Czechs joined
the Russian army. During the
revolution these Czechs made
their historic movement to Vladivostok,
where the group collected
funds to send Hurban to Washington.
There he joined Dr. Thomas
Masaryk in founding the Czech
nation. After the government
was established he returned to
Washington as Czech m ilitary attache,
later going to Egypt as
charge d ’affaires, to Sweden as
minister, and in 1936 back to
Washington as minister. His
greatest accomplishment here
was consummation of the Czech-
U. S. trade treaty last year, now'
abrogated under Hitler's "protectorate”
regime.
WASHINGTON. — Conservative
Henry Morgenthau Jr ., who has patiently
tried, mostly in vain, to ride
herd on the wild-eyed left wingers
of the New Deal, is in for another
headache. This time the threat is
actually coming from some of his
, own bright young men, men who,
strangely enough, have agreed with
the secretary of the treasury
through thick and thin and differed
violently with the gr^up which talks
about spending our way out of depression.
This time it is on taxes. Morgenthau
has always advocated more
taxes. He believes in a balanced
budget. He would like to move revenues
up and cut spending down at
the same time to accomplish this.
He thinks the surest way to move
revenues up is to cut spending down,
for he believes the mere gesture to-
■ ward economy on the part of the
government would inspire such confidence
on the part of business that
profits would increase, and hence
taxes would multiply.
Morgenthau and Harry L. Hopkins,
a very strange team to be
working in any fiscal cause, went to
bat one after the other promising
business that its tax load would be
adjusted. President Roosevelt followed
them with the promise of no
more taxes. But Morgenthau meant
“ adjusted,” he did not mean “ reduced.”
Morgenthau’s idea would be to
reduce specific taxes which tend to
discourage investment. He did not
mean for a moment to reduce the
total expected revenues of the
Treasury.
But his young men, with considerable
prodding from Capitol Hill,
are proposing just that. They figure
that if certain taxes, now calculated
to be discouraging to investment
and new enterprises, should
be lifted, business might revive so
much that the total receipts would
increase. Whereas to make sure
that revenues from the same total
national income remains the same
it would be necessary to impose
some additional taxes to make up for
the discouraging type of taxes reduced.
This, they figure, might defeat
the m ain idea, which is to get
business going and thus work out of
the recession.
Would Have Treasury Gamble
O n Return of Prosperity
In short, as Morgenthau conservatively
views it, they are willing to
have the Treasury gamble on the return
of prosperity. If it wins, then
the temporary tax loss is replaced
| by such business activity that the
reduced rates would produce largely
increased net revenue. Fine! If it
! loses, and the reduced taxes do not
spur business, so that the Treasury
suffers a heavy net loss— well, it was
worth the try.
There are many senators and representatives
who agree with these
young Treasury experts. Tfrey believe
the gamble is worth taking,
and that the chances of winning are
excellent. They also approve the
direction in which such a program
would start the government moving,
regarding it as a distinct veering
away from the path followed since
Roosevelt came into the White
House, which leads, as they see it,
inevitably towards the government
being obliged to take over more and
more business because private capital
has been fearful.
There is another phase on which
there is even less agreement. That
is the proposal to reduce the rates
on very large incomes. Treasury
experts agree that lower taxes on
the high brackets would produce
more income for the government for
the simple reason that as soon as
the rate gets too high the very rich
m an puts his money in tax-exempt
securities. One of the country’s best
known millionaires told a group of
Democratic senators at a lunch recently
that he had put more than
two-thirds of his fortune in tax-
I exempts.
But it is not regarded as good
politics to take the taxes off the
! rich, however sound the economics j
l may be. It opens the door to deina-
I gogic attacks.
App}intments Catch State
Department by Surprise
Two recent appointments caught
the state department completely by
surprise. One was the nam ing of
Laurence A. Steinhardt as ambassador
to Russia. The other was
the promotion of Col. Edwin M. (Pa)
Watson as brigadier general, with
the further statement that he was to
retire and join the White House secretariat.
The state department had thought
Ben Smith, the famous stock m a rket
operator who is alleged to have
made millions on the short side during
the Hoover panic, was to be
ambassador to Russia. And it had
thought “ P a ” Watson would be
made ambassador to Belgium.
The state department had a right
to be surprised. It had been perfectly
right in adding two and two
and getting four. Why it was surprised
was that almost without
warning other things developed. In
the case of Smith, the shrewd m a rket
operator did have the refusal of
the Russian post. He wanted it, and
President Roosevelt had offered it
to him . In fact it had been learned,
through the usual diplom atic channels,
that Sm ith would be acceptable
to the Soviet government.
But while the President was on
his Caribbean trip he received a
wireless from Smith, regretting very
much that personal affairs had
made it impossible for h im to accept.
The situation which had developed
was this. Sm ith had more or
less settled down in the last few
years, as far as business is concerned.
He had cramped his style a
little, before that, by promising that
he would not play hob by short selling
with the Roosevelt adm inistration’s
efforts to revive business. He
was a staunch Roosevelt m a n —
among the early ones. He had
turned bitterly on Hoover during
the crusade of the Hoover adm inistration
against those who were short
selling. What angered h im was the
effort of Hoover’s friends to make
short selling the alibi for the contio*
uance of the depression.
Blamed Low Price of Wheat
On Short Selling by Russia
Indeed it may be recalled that the
Hoover crowd had a blind spot, to
put it very mifcily, with respect to
short selling. Hoover’s secretary of
agriculture, Arthur M. Hyde, tried
to blame the Soviet government for
the low price of wheat at the time
the fa rm board was trying to hold
the price up by buying. Hyde said
the Russians were selling short and
depressing the price. Hyde did not
know that the Russians actually
had a huge surplus of wheat, and
they later delivered the wheat in
taking up their short contracts, to
the great annoyance of the farm
board, which had unwittingly held
the price up for them.
In settling down, Ben Smith
bought an interest in a New York
brokerage house. But when the
time came to achieve his ambition
and accept Roosevelt’s offer of the
Moscow post he found that it would
require a tremendous sacrifice to
get out. Obviously he could not
continue to operate a New York brokerage
business from Moscow. His
partners could carry on, of course,
but there would be plenty of criticism.
And he could not get out without
terrific losses.
President Stalling Until
He Can Be Sure of Course
H aving started to put business in
a good enough humor to bring about
some revival, thus smoothing the
path to the election of a New Dealer
to succeed President Roosevelt, the
administration is just a little afraid
now that congress will steal the
play, overdo the pampering of the
rugged individuals who meet the
pay rolls, and undo some of the reforms
accomplished in the last six
years.
Consider Harry Hopkins over the
last few months. When he was talking
to individual senators, ju st before
his confirmation as secretary of
commerce, he was blunt and to the
point. He has gradually been growing
more cautious in his utterances.
This does not mean the President
has changed the view he expressed
to Hopkins—as is generally believed
—when Roosevelt decided to put
Hopkins in charge of the jo b of
bringing back prosperity. It merely
means the President is stalling until
he can be sure of his course.
When the President was asked
outright if he would oppose repeal
of the undistributed earnings and
capital gains taxes, he replied that
he was not sure. He could not be
sure, he said, until he checked on
how much revenue these taxes were
producing.
What the President m igh t have
said was that he wants more time
to consider, to make up his m ind
just how far he has to go to produce
enough business revival to
make sure of continuance of the
New Deal after the next election,
and how little reform he might have
to sacrifice.
President's Strategy Centers
On IT inning Next Election
Actually Roosevelt is torn between
two conflicting lines of strategy,
both aim ing at precisely the same
thing and for the same object—to
win the next election so that social
reform can march on just as soon
as possible, without the type of setback
which Harding provided after
the Wilson administration.
Harry Hopkins will continue to
give a perfect illustration of the
difficulty Roosevelt is in until
Roosevelt makes up his mind definitely
on specific propositions. For
instance, the taxes he would not
discuss.
So he walked on eggs in his Des
Moines speech, and has been walking
on bubbles in talking to newspaper
men since. He is frightened
by the word “ appeasement,” could
not imagine where it originated. Yet
the very day before, the President
had not objected to the same word
in a question. Perplexing? No. The
President doesn't have to be tactful
to his advisers. Hopkins fears indiscretion
on his part might rouse
his present critics in the inner c ircle
to such efforts that his appeasement
plans would be toppled over.

" T H E National Safety council has
1 charged pedestrians with a
large share of the responsibility
for traffic accidents that killed 39,-
500 persons in 1937. O f this total
15.400 were pedestrians.
In "Accident Facts,” a statistical
review of 1937, the council
said: “ Many pedestrians show utter
lack of caution in their use of
streets and highways. Combined
state reports for 1937 show that in
67 per cent of all fatal pedestrian
accidents the pedestrian either
was violating a traffic law or was
acting in an obviously unsafe m anner.
In non-fatal accidents pedestrian
faults appeared in 69 per
cent of the cases.”
The council described such
things as jay-walking, failure to
observe traffic lights, drunken
walking, walking with instead of
against traffic on rural highways,
crossing streets in the middle of ■
block as "pedestrian faults.”

‘‘No. I never had one. It was a
nightmare. You know, the kind we
all have sometimes. We know we’re
in bed. We see the fam iliar furniture
of our room—yet something
horrible and incredible happens.”
They had reached the beach and
were standing before the bath-house
Jo a n shared with her aunt and Mrs.
Spencer Forbes. “ I ’ll be ready in
flve m inutes," she promised, as she
entered it.
She was not, of course. Hale
stretched himself out on the sand
before the door, rather like a guarding
dog, and pondered what she had
told him. When she came out ready
for the water she was determinedly
brisk and companionable.
“ Let’s talk about something cheerful
the rest of the tim e ,” she invited,
as they walked toward the
sea. “ I want my thoughts distracted.”
‘‘A ll right. I ’ll do anything but
make love to you.”
She sighed ostentatiously.
“ Why this cold reserve? That
m ight distract my mind better than
anything else.”
“ I don’t doubt it would. But I ’m
serving warning on you right now.
Miss Kneeland. I'm not going to
fall in love with you.”
“ ‘Miss Kneeland,’ too," she m u rmured.
“ Only a few minutes ago it
was Joan. Oh, the bitter heartache
of th a t!”
They had joined hands and were
entering the water. “ I suppose what
you’re really telling m e ,” she added
as the waves lifted them up, “ is
that you will always be a brother
to m e .”
“ E x actly."
They began to sw%n toward the
float.
"The trouble is,” she pointed out,
“ that I don't need another brother.
1 have Bert. He’s entirely satisfactory.”
Rex scoffed.
“ As a brother I can put circles
all around Bert. You'll see. But
you mustn't undermine my morale
by making love to me,” he reminded
her. "T hat isn’t fair "
"Stop talking. I'm getting tired
already.”
He put a steadying arm under her
chest and kept it there till they
reached the float. He could feel the
quick beating of her heart against
it. He was a trifle dizzy as they
scrambled up the side of the float
and wiped the salt water out of their
eyes. They sat still, resting, and
he kept his gaze on the shore line.
There was a short silence which he
did not want to break.
“ I ’ve always known,” she said at
last, “ that I was like Queen Victo
ria.”
“ Not in appearance, thank God,”
Hale said promptly. "Not even, I
should say, in temperament. In
what respect. Miss Bones, do you
think you're like our dear late
Queen?”
“ I've always known that if I ever
met a m an I really wanted to marry
I'd probably have to propose to him.
He would think he couldn’t propose
to me because I have some money.
Queen Victoria proposed to Prince
Albert, you know.”
“ I ’ve heard so,” Hale admitted
cautiously. “ How did she do it?
I seem to have forgotten the details.”
"She did it,” Joan said firmly, “ in
a nice, ree-fined, ladylike way. She
made it an affair of state. She
pointed out to Albert that everyone
expected him to marry her, and
that he and she might as well fall
in with the general plan.”
Hale shook his red head.
“ That wouldn't make a hit with
an American m a n ," he declared.
"W o uld n’t it make a hit with
y o u ?” Joan asked anxiously.
“ It would not."
“ Well, suppose some lovely young
thing told you she needed a protector
and felt sure you were it.
Would that appeal?”
“ Nope."
“ You interest me strangely. What
sort of proposal would appeal to
you? 1 may nefH to know.”
“ That’s an easy one. I should
expect to be wooed, patiently and
tenderly, for a long time. Then I
should expect a really tempestuous,
whirlwind proposal, full of passion
and fire. It would have to be the
kind that would sweep me ofl my
feet.”
Jo a n sighed.
“ You have postponed for a long
tim e, perhaps forever,” she told him
sadly, " a pregnant interview I had
in m in d .”
They both laughed, and Hale's
heart rose. He told himself that at
last he was seeing the real Joan
Kneeland. There couldn't be anything
seriously wrong with a girl
like that. His faint suspicion that
aomeone was trying to injure her
was the result of an overstimulated
imagination.
“ And now that’s settled," he suggested
joyously, "le t’s swim a little
way toward Spain."
They dived together and started
off with fine abandon. But almost
immediately, it seemed to him, she
was tired again. He made her turn
back and again supported her on the
return swim to the shore. When she
left the water her mood had
changed.
“ I'm as weak as a cat,” she said
bitterly.
Her eyes were full of fear as she
looked at him. "R ex , what does it
m e an ?” she asked in a whisper.
“ We’re going to find o u t," he
promised. “ Will you follow my advice?”
“ I think so. What is it? ”
"N atu rally , I haven't any faith in
Craig. Let me take you tomorrow
answer till the next morning, so I
always did. That was fatal, of
course. By the next day I had forgotten
the proposals."
“ How about them ?” Hale grinned.
“ Weren’t they standing around in
rows reminding you?”
“ They were not. YdVi’d never believe
it, Rex, but they forgot, too.
If I remembered something about
them a few months later, and asked
if we were engaged or anything of
that sort, every lad of them swore
I had refused him and that hi*
heart was now another's. After a
few years of this I remembered
enough to grasp Spencer Forbes the
night he spoke, and to write him a
note the next morning confirming
our engagement. I hastened our
marriage, too. I realized that I
couldn't keep the matter in mind
I hate to have doctors fussing over m e . ’ 1
after lunch to a New York doctor
who has a cam p near here—Doctor
Nicholas Crosby. Let him make a
thorough examination and give you
a diagnosis and a schedule. We'll
take Bert to him at the same time.
Bert may need some help in upbuilding.”
C H A PT ER V n i
When they entered the house Hale
telephoned at once to Doctor Nick
Crosby to make the appointment for
the next day. The result was disappointing.
Jo a n stood beside him
at the telephone. He made his report
to her with raised eyebrows.
"Crosby is in New York. He won’t
be back till Monday.’’
Jo a n nodded.
" I 'm glad. I hate to have doctors
fussing over me, especially
strange ones.”
" J u s t the same— ” He looked at
her thoughtfully, surprised at his
own disappointment and annoyance
over the doctor's absence. For
some reason the delay seemed serious.
“ This is Friday. Let's go to New
York early tomorrow morning,” he
suddenly suggested. “ I know two
good doctors there. I can surely
get hold of one of them by telephone
today. If I can't. I'll look up
someone else.”
She scoffed at the idea.
" I n this heat? It would be a crazy
thing to do,” .
He persisted.
"No, it wouldn’t. I ’ll get an early
appointment for you. Then we'll
lunch on the cool roof of some New
York hotel, and take an early train
back.”
She was firm in her refusal and
he had to give in.
“ Aside from everything else,” she
pointed out, " I want a doctor at
hand if I need one at all. We’ll
wait for Doctor Crosby. Mrs. Nash
swears by h im .”
Ainsworth waved a hand to him
as they passed the living-room door
on their way upstairs, but Hale escorted
Joan to her room and then
went on to his own. Ainsworth
could wait.
Joan did not come down to tea
and Hale was not surprised. He devoted
himself to Mrs. Spencer
Forbes and Miss Hosanna, and listened
inattentively to the latter's
long account of thc evil effect of
too many eggs on the human system.
“ What you should do,” she assured
h im , “ i* to live largely on
fruit and vegetables.” Hale shuddered.
and Mrs. Spencer Forbes
laughed unfeelingly. When, a little
later, he and she were again alone
together for a few minutes, he urged
her to explain her cryptic remarks
of an hour ago. She looked blank
and pretended that she had no idea
what he was talking about.
“ Dear boy,” she begged, “ never
expect me to remember anything I
say, or anything that anyone else
says. When I was young, various
beautiful young men begged me to
be theirs. I thought It would be
coy and maidenly to postpone my
very long. Now tell me all about
your sex life, Rex.”
Miss Hosanna rose, folded up her
knitting, and regarded her friend
severely.
“ Really, Ruth, you get worse every
day,” she declared. “ I'm afraid
this young m an is encouraging you
in it.”
" I wasn't going to tell her a thing,
Miss Hosanna,” Hale protested ear
nestly. “ Not even about the Mandarin
Princess in Pekin or the R a jah
's daughter in C alcutta.”
"Y o u seem to run to potentates,’
Mrs. Spencer Forbes murmured
“ Were you ever in Pekin or Calc
u tta?”
“ Never. That—” Hale explained
smugly, "is why I wasn't going to
tell you about those ladies.”
Miss Hosanna sighed again and
walked toward the door.
" It's time to dress for dinner,
she reminded them. "W hy you two
keep up this nonsense all the time
is more than I can see. There’s
some excuse for this dear boy. He's
young. But you, Ruth, are old
enough to know better."
Mrs. Spencer Forbes nodded sadly.
" I know,” she corroborated.
“ Thirty-six."
Mi9s Hosanna sniffed, “ Thirtys
ix !'' she quoted. "H u m p h !”
“ I know it should be an age of
wisdom—and look at me! Keep right
on looking, R e x ," Mrs. Spencer
Forbes added tenderly. “ I like to
have you do it. But tell me one
thing before we p a rt." she added as
the three went upstairs together.
“ Do you think there's any danger
S h e e r F a b r i c s , L a c e , C o l o r
V a r i e d H e a d d r e s s f o r B r i d e
By CHERIE NICHOLAS
that Hosanna will reconstruct my
moral nature? She’s been working
at the job now for more than quarter
of a century. There are moments
wherTl (eel uplifted, and almost
discouraged.''
Hale went on to his room smiling.
Dinner that night was a pleasant
meal. The change in Bert, an
amazing and heart-warming change,
continued. His overwrought look,
his jerkiness of movement and gesture,
were almost gone.
Ainsworth observed everyone with
his usual cat-like watchfulness.
Though it was Friday night Casper
Kneeland had not arrived. Rex suspected
that Kneeland was deliberately
keeping out of the way to give
him a free hand with Ainsworth.
Miss Hosanna looked pleased and
then sighed deeply when Hale
praised the lobster a la Newburg
“ Poison,” she murmured. "A ll
shell-fish is poison, of course. But
you may give me a spoonful, Banks,
I ’ll just try It.”
Joan, Rex noticed, ate little and
said less. She listened to the others
and smiled occasionally. She
was not the same girl who, on the
float, had threatened to propose to
him. These quick shifts of mood
and m anner were very disconcerting.
After dinner they had a lesson in
the new Continental, which Rex J}ad
learned abroad. Joan, who was a
born dancer, was interested and
fairly successful at it. Ainsworth
did less well, and Bert and Mrs.
Spencer Forbes refused to try it at
all. The party broke up early. Hale
was not surprised when Ainsworth
caught him by the arm as they left
the living-room.
"W ill you make yourself comfortable
and drop into my diggings a little
later, old m a n 0” he urged in a
low voice. " I ’d like a word with
you.”
Rex glanced at his watch and
nodded. It was only half past ten.
He would be glad to have the showdown
with Ainsworth and get it
over.
He tapped at Ainsworth’s door as
the clock in the hall downstairs
struck eleven. Ainsworth opened the
door at once and greeted him almost
warmly.
"N ice room,” Rex approved. It
was a nice room, as pleasant as his
own. It had a more personal atmosphere,
lent by books and pictures.
"Y e s ,” Ainsworth explained, " I
brought down a few things of mine
from New York—books and such.”
Rex raised his eyebrows.
"Then you’re expecting to stay
on?” he asked.
Ainsworth looked surprised. The
effect was convincing. He really
seemed surprised.
"O h . yes. I ’ll be here all summ
e r,” he announced, "probably till
the Camp closes. The fam ily usually
goes back to town about the
middle of October. That will suit
me very well. Everything in New
York will be dead till then, anyway.
What I want to talk to you
about,” he went on conversationally,
as they sat down and lit their
cigarettes, "is Craig. Didn’t he
leave pretty suddenly and, as it
were, by request?”
Hale grinned. Ainsworth’s curiosity
always amused him.
"H e did—and as it happened, by
my request. B ut of course Uncle
Cass had authorized me to act for
h im ,” Hale ended sedately.
"T hat's odd.’’ Ainsworth looked
at him thoughtfully. "O ne would
have thought Bert would have had
some voice about that,” he ended
after a moment of apparent reflection.

F O R T U N A T E indeed is the brider
to-be who is planning a lovely
spring wedding, in that fashion is
not setting down arbitrary rules in
the matter of bridal array but rather
is encouraging fancy-free individual
choices.
This departure from stereotyped
traditional dress is particularly evidenced
in the matter of color. The
prospective bride who has secretly
cherished the idea of an eye-appealing
subtle tint for her nuptial gown
and veil instead of traditional white,
will have the joy of finding that
dreams do come true.
A very successful color technique
on the part of designers robes the
bride and her maids in the same
color or, as the case may be, in
different intensity of the same color.
A suggestion along this line is pale
pink satin for the wedding gown
with bridesmaids’ bouffant dresses
of sheerest net in a trifle deeper
tone. The bride either wears white
orchids or carries roses in the pink
of her gown, while the attendants’
flowers are of deeper hue.
As to the styling of the gowns,
sentiment runs high in favor of fullskirted
types with quaint, fitted bodices
or hiplength basque effects.
There is a pronounced flair this
spring for exquisitely sheer weaves
for both bride and maids, such as
marquisette, mousseline de soie, or
nets of sheerest type.
As to lace for the wedding gown
it is ever a favorite the more so
this spring in that enthusiasm for
lace is so general throughout all
fashiondom. The gown pictured fits
into the springtime wedding scene
with queenly grace, its artful soft
styling brings skirt fullness to the
front in latest approved manner. Its
form-fitting midriff accents a slender
waistline as is required of fashions
today. The heart-shaped neckline
and the high shouldered fullat-
top long fitted sleeves are significant
styling details.
No matter how entrancing her
gown, a bride fails at looking her
prettiest if her headdress and veil
do not flatter. Here again is fashion
indulgent to the spring bride, in
that the new fantasies of tulle and
flowers and lace include every possible
type, suited tc every individuality.
Best of all, in the modern way
of doing things there is no fuss or
flurry at the last moment to get the
veil pinned into shape by nervous
unskilled fingers, for that has been
taken care of in advance by specialists.
All that is required of the
bride-to-be is to take her milliner
into confidence long before the happy
day or the consulting adviser in
the wedding bureau where you are
supposed to come and ask questions,
as established nowadays in all highclass
establishments. If it is a period
type, or a youthful ingenue
headdress, or a stately coronet, if it
be a simple inexpensive piece or a
most elaborate one let your needs
be known and by some magic, it’s
there before your very eyes.
The various types of headdress
shown in the little inset pictures
are typical new trends such as are
available in shops and specialty departments
that cater to seekers ol
bridal array.

TIPS ,o

Plan t S e e d s C a r e fu lly
\Vr HEN vegetable and (lower
* * seeds purchased from reputable
firms do not germinate as
they should, it is safe to assume
that conditions are not favorable
for growth, or that seeds were not
planted properly.
Therefore, it is of greatest im portance
to plant seeds according
to directions on the packets. Extremely
small seeds must be covered
only lightly with soil, according
to Harold N. Coulter, vegetable
expert.
The will to grow is strong in
seeds, but they have their lim itations.
To plant a tiny seed, like
the petunia, under an inch of soil
is like burying a man under a 20-
story building and asking him to
push it away.
Heavier, larger seeds, of course,
may be planted deeper. Beans
and cucumbers may be covered
with three-quarters of an inch to
a full inch of soil. Peas and corn
sprout vigorously and may be
planted from an inch to an inch
and one-half deep.
Many successful home gardeners
actually cover peas and corn
with an extra half-inch of soil after
they begin to push through.
This protects them from birds,
and also helps keep weeds down.

Myth of Copper Discovery by Michigan
Pig Is Discredited by Son of Pioneer
Gypsy Dress Late
Caprice of Fashion
Stripes and plaids in taffeta, in
silk crepe, in printed linens in thin
wools in glamorous cottons are selling
as fast as the yards and yards
it requires for a full-at-the-hem skirt
can be measured off. These skirts
are usually gathered in peasantwise
at the waistline. To be sure
a blouse is inevitable and what a
story of charm and romance the
new blouses do tell! Together skirt
and blouse are providing the big
sensation in the spring pageantry
of fashion.
Victorian Hair-Dos
They’re wondering, now, who really
discovered the Copper Country’s
copper—the late William Royal or
his pig, observes a Hancock, Mich.,
correspondent in the Detroit Free
Press.
Legend has it that Royal’s pig
first laid bare the priceless secret—
but, after 73 years, the popular theory
has been exploded by a gentleman
from Los Angeles.
The m an in question is none other
than Thomas L. Royal, son of the
copper-finding Royal—and he startled
Copper Country old-timers on a
visit here with the almost unbelievable
information that his father never
owned a pig.
Now the story goes back to 1865,
when the late Royal operated a wayside
inn on the present site of the
village of Calumet and in the very
heart of one of the world’s richest
copper areas. Royal, so the legend
goes, catered to explorers, scientists
and voyageurs, and consequently
paid little or no attention to
his small drove of hogs.
The hogs foraged for themselves
during the winter and one day Royal
found them missing. Setting out
to find them, he c a n e upon one lean
porker munching leaves under a
stone ledge the size of a cottage.
Royal chased the hog, but first observed
that he stood under a shelter
of peculiar rock, mottled green and
•shot with red. Investigation proved
the rock to be conglomerate.
E. J. Hulbert, one of the greatest
mining men ir. the early days of the
industry, later acquired the property,
and in no time at all several
mining companies were thriving on
the location.
That's the legend-— and it’s the
story they’ve all faithfully believed
for 75 years. But now they’re wondering
whom to credit for the copper
discovery—Royal or his pig.
Bring New Bonnets
With the revival of Victorian hairdos
there comes a group of bonnets
including an open or cabriolet style
often trimmed with plain taffeta ribbons.
with matching gloves; smaller
shapes covering the top of the
head and tied under the chin,
trimmed with veils having embroidered
borders; and coal-scuttle bonnets
jutting forward, in fine straws
or white pique.
Magnrt Saves Cows
Every year thousands of cows die
as the result of swallowing pieces
of wire, nails and bits of metal.
Often these lodge in portions of the
stomach not easily reached by the
operating surgeon, and now a veterinary
surgeon has thought out a
way of dealing with lu ch cases; his
method is being practiced widely,
says London Tit-Bits Magazine. The
surgeon make* an incision and inserts
into the anim al's stomach a
powerful sterilized magnet which
draws the metal pieces to It. In
country areas where it is impossible
to plug the magnet into a
m ain, it can be operated by an ordinary
car battery.
Beige Suits Spiked
With Vivid Shades
Paris dressmaker strategy with
beige suits is to dose them a-plenty
with vivid color, such as red,
splashy printed stufT, or gaudy pink
and such pastels. The color comes
in the blouse, hat, gloves, and other
details.
Or they put a beige Jacket with a
brown or black skirt, and throw in
a brilliant blouse and accessories in
a third color.

DOCTOR FRANCIS E.
TOWNSENI)
Introduced as . . .
GENERAL WELFARE
ACT, H. R. 2
A N D H E L P R E B U IL D A M E R IC A !
After six Ion* years of vain and futile effort on the part of state and
federal government, largely devoted to unintelligent and wholly uncoordinated
experiments, there is as yet no indication of any inclusive and effective
recovery from the economic downfall of 1929-1932.
Meanwhile, throughout most of this six-year period, there has be« n
growing, under the guidance of Dr. Francis E. Townsend, a popular movement
in favor of the Townsend Recovery Plan, which he originated.
It was originally put forth as an Old Age Pension plan and was widely
condemned by the unthinking and financial powers, because it seemed to call
for a pension of $200 a month to each person over 60 years of age. It became
misrepresented and maligned as just that and nothing else.
The truth is that the Townsend Recovery Plan is a comprehensive,
logical, practicable plan for the rehabilation and stabilisation of the whole
national economic structure. It is the only plan thus far prominently advocated
that will save the nation from a premature and politically controlled
-and therefore corrupt and dictatorial—lapse into oommunism on the one
hand, or a bloody civil war on the other.
Its aim is purely one of social justice and economic security for all
worthy people of every age It is designed to provide opportunity for youth
profitable work for young manhood and womanhood, security for the middleaged
to enjoy the fruits of their own individual labors, and comfort for the
aged, which has been denied them under the present system of industrial
peonage and financial brigandage, not to mention political banditry.
The plan—embodied in a bill known as H. R. 2— proposes to collect a
tax of 2 per cent on all business transactions; to set up a revolving fund with
this tax, which shall be divided monthly, pro rata, after administrative costs
are paid, among all eligible applicants. Two hundred dollars per month is
the maximum payment, as provided by the act.
Eligible applicants -are defined as all citizens of the United States,
60 years of age or over, free from criminal record, who will retire from gainful
occupation and agree to spend the monthly annuity payments within the
borders of the United State*- within 30 days from the time they receive them
for American-made goods.
Restrictions placed upon the spending are such as would prevent the
money for being used to support able-bodied sons and daughters in idleness.
The money may not be given away, beyond a certain liberal percentage to
churches and charities. It must be paid for bona fide goods and services, to
the end that trade shall be stimulated and employment of labor increased.
The plan proposes to abolish poverty in the United States. It would
do so, since it would establish and maintain buying power in every countryside,
hamlet, village, and city in the country, and require that buying power
to be used.
It would eventually wipe out all forms of public charity, such as community
chests, poor farms and poor houses, doles, WPA , PWA , etc., since it
would assure continued and even increasing demand for the products of industry,
the services of professional people, the means of transportation and
communication.
It would simplify the taxation system of the country by substituting
a simple direct tax for the complicated and unjust taxation schemes now
foisted upon the country’ by a greedy political heirarchy.
The spending provision in the Recovery Plan world bring immediate
benefits to every class of people. The farmers would find a readier market
and a better price for food products. Labor would have plenty of work producing
goods and rendering services. Salesmen would find more buyers for
their wares. Doctors and nurses, dentists and occulists would be busy beyond
any previous experience. Merchants would again be heartened by the merry
peal of the cash register.
Everybody, in the course of making his living, has to sell something—
his time, his muscle, his products or his goods. Unemployment, pauperism,
the need of relief doles and “ made work,” have all arisen from the lack of
buying power throughout the nation. It is this lack of sustained buying
power that the government has failed to cure. In fact, its uncoordinaetd experiments
have defeated themselves, since buying power declined steadily, so
far as a majority of the nation’s producers are concerned, ever since 1929.
Increased taxation, increased numbers on relief or on low-wage work projects,
and a general loss of confidence in the future, have led people to withhold
purchasing power, if they had it, and have tremendously cut down the
purchasing power of millions, until they have practically none left.
Buying power, and the resultant consumption of goods and services,
are not stimulated by the so-called “subsistence wage,” since it is evident
that those who are now employed are supplying all that is needed for a bare
"subsistence” level or standard of living. Some large and universally distributed
group or class of people MUST be provided with quick, effective
buying power AT ONCE, and THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. It could
be young people going to school, but it is not deemed good for the young
people themselves, nor good for society that they should have the weakened
morale nor the general attitude which such a g ift would be likely to give them.
It could be the parents of children. One country in Europe, it is said,
pays a bonus to the parents upon the birth of each child. However, we are
still individualists and most AM E R IC A N parents will prefer an opportunity
to support their own children rather than accept government gifts, as a price
for their human liberty,
But here are the people of 60 years and over. Their days of active
usefulness are nearly over. Most of them have done their life’s work, have
earned a few hours of leisure and repose. Many of them are broken in
health and need the services of doctors, dentists, occulists, nurses, and so on.
Many of them are compelled by financial stringencies to continu# working.
Their rewards are small, so they) cannot have the professional attentions
they need.
What could be more appropriate than to make these aged people— of
whom every community has its share— the medium through which to distribute
the much-needed buying power that will soon spread employment,
prosperity, opportunity and happiness to every family and individual in the
land? It is just that they who have toiled through the heat of the day shall
enjoy their reward in the cool of the evening. The nation owes it to them,
more especially since the government failed in its duty to protect the sanctity
of their possessions in the case of millions who were robbed of their life
savings in the wild speculations of 15 to 20 years ago. ,
The two per cent transaction tax is less than the discount that any
merchant would be glad to grant to his customers for cash payments at the
time of purchase. Let the purchases made by elderly people which now
average about $27 per month, jump to $75 per month, which they would probably
be during the first months of operation of thc Recovery Act. A t once
this money would begin to circulate throughout the community, more people
would be in a position to buy more goods, employ more help and build the new
houses and buildings that are badly needed, and pay cash for more of thc
things they need.
It aims to reward labor and services more liberally, and as fully as possible
and consistent with the maintenance of what is known as the profit
system. Its effect would be to spread profits out to a larger propjrtion of
the people without greatly reducing the profits of any legitimate enterprise.
In other words, the increased consumption of goods and employment of services
would extend opportunity for profitable work to the millions who are
now. and have long been, almost or wholly without employment or income.

CONSERVATION PICTURE
will be shown at the Badger Theatre

5 and 6, as an added feature, together
with the main picture which is “Citadel,”
on Wednesday, and “ Off the
Record,’’ on Thursday night.
is passed, said trappers appearing before
a hearing on the bill.
The bill, by Charles Westfahl, Republican,
is supported by humane and
animal protection societies. Opposing
it is the conservation department and
trappers.
In addition to the provisions that
the trap kill immediately or hold the
animal unhurt, the bill also provides
that all traps be stamped with the
owner’s name, and that set traps must
not remain unvisited for 24 hours.
Walter E. Scott of the conservation
department said that if the bill passed
trappers would lose about $200,000
worth of present equipment which
would become illegal, and that it
would cost about $300,000 to get new
legal equipment. He added, “ I f the
bill passes, we will have fa r less
trappers in the state and lose $10,000
to $15,000 in revenue.
Violators of the law would be fined
not less than $100 and not more than
$500, or imprisoned from 30 days to
six months.
Boost Marriage Cost
The advent of spring did not leave
the state legislators kindly disposed
to the fact that then young persons
are rumored to fall in love. Instead,
the assembly made it more expensive
to marry by boosting county clerks’
fees for issuing licenses from 50 cents
to one dollar. The bill now goes to the
senate.
To discourage development of a m ilitary
spirit among children, Assemblyman
Henry. Berquist, Progressive, has
introduced a bill which places a heavy
tax on manufacturers of military toys
$100 a year, independent retailers $5
a year, and retailers which are members
of chain stores from $10 to $20
yearly.
Leas Severe Floods
Flood conditions in Wisconsin this
year are likely to be less severe than
in recent years, says Adolph Kannenberg,
water power examiner for the
public service commission.
He explained that because of a fa irly
mild winter the ground is not as
heavily frozen as in past years and
much of the flood water may be absorbed
by the ground instead of running
off and producing floods.
Though northern Wisconsin has
about a foot of snow which is somewhat
heavier than normal, unusual
flood conditions will not be produced
if there is normal melting and runoff.
Heavy rains, however, combined with
the snow, could product* considerable
floods, he said.
The Wisconsin commission together
with the water resources bureau of
the U. S. Geological Survey measures
Wisconsin lake levels and the flow of
Wisconsin streams. The commission
also supervises operation of about
1,100 dams in the state by dam owners,
and exercises this supervision in
the spring to minimize flood conditions
when possible.
O’Brien Reappointed
Governor Julius Heil has reappointed
William E. O’Brien of Kenosha to
the state highway commission for another
six year term. Following confirmation
by the senate the Governor
further announced that O’Brien would
become chairman of the commission.
Thomas Davlin, a La Follette appointee,
w'as formerly chairman of the
three-men highway commission.
In the senate, Republicans, Progressives,
and Democrats alike lauded
the Governor’s choice and gave their
unanimous approval. This was in
direct contrast to the action of a few
days earlier when the governor’s
selection of Mrs. Lila Burton, Eagle,
to the board of control, was questioned
by Progressives and action on confirmation
was delayed for a week.

the shoulders are shirred and the
waistline gathered. Make this of
silk crepe, georgette, chiffon or
flat crepe. Wear flowers or a jeweled
pin at the becoming, deep vnecklme.
For slim figures, the bowtrimmed
bolero frock (No. 1705)
is particularly flattering, and it’s
new as tomorrow morning! The
dress, even without the bolero, is a
real charmer, with its high neckline,
flaring skirt and tiny, tiny
waist. Tailored enough for daytime,
and yet appropriate for afternoon
parties, too. Thin wool, j
flat crepe or silk print are pretty
m aterials for this.

It is a circular basket of reeds

Here’s a yarn that sounds as if it might have happened
out in the old Wild West when two-gun hombres {ought it out
in the streets and booted and spurred cowpunchers cleaned out
dance halls with well-directed volleys from their six guns.

It wasn't a hostile arm y—but at the same time it wasn’t a friendly one
either. It was a Bolshevik arm y moving to attack Vladivostok, not
fa r away as distances go in Siberia.
Sam says there were thousands of them, well equipped with
machine guns, and lugging enough field pieces to blow those SO
Americans and their box cars to Halifax. But they couldn't be
bothered with the Americans. Taking Vladivostok was more im portant.
Sam Acted as Provost Guard at the Station.
On the afternoon of Ja n u ary 18, Sam was acting provost guard at
the railroad station. It was a bitter cold day. A cutting wind was
■weeping past the station and Private P at Strong, on sentry go, was
■tamping up and down the platform. Two Bolshevik troop trains had
ADVENTUROUS
AMERICANS
By
Elmo Scott Watson
He whipped the automatic up and let go.
Just pulled in on a siding, and Bolshevik soldiers had crowded into the
station where they could buy hot tea and vodka. And as Pat Strong
paced up and down the platform a big Russian said something to h im in
Russian.
P a t couldn’t understand h im . He came to port arms while the
R ussian stormed and gesticulated, and finally grabbed P a t’s gun. P at
tried to pull the gun away, but the Russian was a powerful brute. He
■pun P a t around and threw h im in a snow bank. A couple more Americans
came running up. He threw them into the snow bank, too, and
m ade a m ad dash for the station.
That's where Sam came into the picture. As provost guard, he
rated a sentry box down at the end of the platform . He saw the
fight just as the Russian broke loose and started into the station,
and he came out on the run. With the other three Americans
at his back he started after him .
Says he: “ I went bursting into the station as if the whole U. S.
arm y was stepping on m y heels. That station was full of Bolshies,
singing, talking and yelling. Lots of them had rifles, some of them had
hand grenades tied to their belts. But I didn’t have time to look over
the grenade situation ju st then. That big Russian had found himself a
rifle. I was flve feet inside the door when I spotted h im , but he must have
seen me flrst because he was raising his g un."
It Was a Question Who Would Shoot First.
Sam had a .45 automatic, and it was a question of whether
be or the Russian could shoot first. Without even taking time
out to think, he whipped that automatic up and let go. The big
Russian dropped. For an instant there was a dead silence in
the station. “ Those Ruskies were surprised," says Sam, “ and so
was I. For a second—well—I almost opened fire on the whole
bunch of them, but ■ caught myself just in tim e ."
It was a tough spot and Sam knew it. Here was a whole roomful of
wild Russians and he had just shot one of their pals. I f he started out
the door, some of them would be sure to begin shooting. If that happened,
there'd be general disorder, with 60 Americans fighting a whole
troop train full of Bolsheviks. And what was more to the point, it would
be curtains for Sam.
“ I had to use my head,” he says, “ and I decided I'd bluff
them. I stood in the middle of the floor, waved my pistol over
their heads and pointed to the door. And then happened the
thing that probably saved my life. In swinging my arm I tightened
my grip on the pistol to keep from dropping it. And in
doing that I squeexed the trigger too hard. B A N G ! Off she
went again. That bullet struck somewhere behind the bar and
down came a lot of glassware.”
Sam says the falling glass created a terrible racket. The Russians
m u st have thought a shell had burst in there. They turned and stampeded
for the door, and Sam says they went through it like a Kansas
tornado. In ten seconds there wasn’t a Bolshevik in the place.
“ And where were the other three fellows?” says Sam. “ They
were outside, turned into a rear guard. When they heard those
shots inside and saw all those Ruskies piling out, they ran for
eam p to tell the others the Russians had eaten me alive and
were coming to eat them, too.”
Sam says he certainly did NOT feel like a hero when he went into
that station. He just d id n’t have tim e to think about it. “ It was only
after I got inside,” he says, “ that I realized I was in a swell pickle.
I'v e often thought afterwards, suppose I hit one of the grenades those
Russians had tied to their belts.”
Boy, that WOULD have been an adventure.

Cellulose Found in Most Plant Matter Specimens
Unlucky North Pole Seeker
O N O CTO B ER 25, 1B33, an automobile
in Washington, D. C.,
struck down and killed a 71-year-old
m an who, for 20 years, had defied
the numerous pitfalls of death in
the frozen North and who once just
missed sharing in the honors or of
discovering the North pole. He was
Evelyn B Baldwin.
Baldwin first went beyond the
Arctic circle in 1893 as meteorologist
with Capt. Robert Peary's second
expedition to Greenland. On a
previous expedition. Perry found
what he thought was a "ro y al road
to the pole," via Independence bay.
Baldwin suggested that a better
route lay through Kane basin. But
Peary decided otherwise Ironically
enough, when Peary did make his
successful dash to the pole, sev«ral
years later it was by the very route
which Baldwin had suggested.
In 1897 Baldwin was en route to
accompany the famous Andree balloon
expedition to find the pole when
Andree, suddenly favored by good
weather, decided to start, without
waiting the arrival of Baldwin's
ship next day. On Ju ly 11, the illfated
Andree sailed away, never to
be heard of again until 1930 when a
party of Norwegian explorers found
his skeleton.
But this narrow escape from
death did not daunt Baldwin. In
1898 he was second in command of
the Wellman expedition which
reached the then "farthest north”
of 81 degrees and 30 seconds before
turning back. Baldwin then set
off with several companions and discovered
new land, named Graham
Bell land.
In 1901 he made his supreme attem
pt to reach the pole with the
Baldwin-Ziegler expedition. It failed
because his supply ship did not arrive
in time and only good luck prevented
the entire party from perishing.
Before he could finance another
expedition Peary discovered
the pole and Baldwin's career as an
explorer ended.

Tenderfoot Triumph
I F E V E R Americans deserved the
* title “ tenderfeet." it was the
band of emigrants, led by John Bidwell,
which left Missouri in May.
1841, for the West. They had heard
of the riches of California but knew
nothing about the country they must
cross to gain their promised land
Once they reached the Great Salt
lake, they believed they could float
down rivers that were supposed to
flow to the Pacific. So they took ■
big supply of tools to build boats
when needed.
Guided by Thomas Fitzpatrick,
the fur trader, and Father De
Smedt, the missionary, they reached
South pass in Wyoming safely.
Then, despite warnings against trying
to cross the desert of the Central
basin, they turned off from the
Oregon trail and headed southwest.
Soon they were in a bewildering
country of salt plains. Food and
water supplies ran low. Cruel m irages
lured them on. But somehow
they managed to survive and
reach the Humboldt river in Nevada.
They followed it to the H um boldt
Sink and turned south to the
I Carson river. By the tim e they
reached the Walker river they were
i forced to kill the last of their oxen.
Six weary months after leaving
Missouri they reached the rich San
Jo aqu in valley. Theirs had been an
epic journey. For the success of
the Bidwell expedition pointed the
way for the flrst thin trickle of
emigration to California that began
soon afterwards and reached its
high tide in the Golden Days of '49.
Most types of plant matter contain
large amounts of cellulose. Cellulose,
as well as starch, is formed
by the linking together of large num bers
of molecules of certain sugars
known as he'xoses. The hexose sugars.
which include all of the
fam ilia r sugars, are characterized
by the fact that they contain a
string of six carbon atoms in their
molecules.
Corncobs, grain hulls and straw,
■nd bagasse (dried sugar cane
stalks) contain in addition a class
of compounds known as pentosans.
Pentosans are also built up from
a large number of sugar molecules,
but of a type known as pentoses,
containing five instead of six
carbon atoms.
When hexoses are heated with dilute
acids, says a writer in the Chicago
Tribune, extensive decomposition
takes place, with the formation
of caramel and various organic
acids. S im ila r treatment applied
to pentoses results in the formation
of a large amount of furfural, ■
clear, water-insoluble liquid with ■
characteristic pungent odor.
Furfural, different from all other
cheaply produced organic compounds,
has its most important use
in the refining of petroleum lubricants.
F urfural is one of those compounds
that do not dissolve in
the oil but are capable of washing
out from it a large part of the tarry
materials that detract from its
lubricating properties.
Bad Boy of the Mayflower
A MONG the P ilgrim Fathers who
* * came over on the Mayflower
was John Billington, accompanied
by his wife and two sons, Francis
and John J r . Early in that historic
voyage young John disgraced h im self.
While playing in the family's
cabin with his father's fowling
picce, he fired the weapon close to
an open keg of powder “ Only the
Lord's mercy saved the ship and
the entire company from being
blown to pieces,” writes a pious
historian of those days.
1 After the P ilgrim s had settled
Plymouth, young Johnny got into
j another scrape. He wandered off
I into the woods one day by himself
When he failed to return, a party
set out to look for him. After a
week's futile search, it was learned
that he was in an Indian village 20
miles south of Plymouth.
His mother shed tears of gratitude
when friendly Indians brought
him back, but some of the Pilgrims
were "sorely vexed" because he had
put them to al) this bother. No
doubt, he came by his trouble-making
honestly for his father was that
kind of m an. In fact, John Bilhngton,
senior, has the unenviable distinction
of being the first person
hanged in Plymouth colony. He
quarreled with young John Newcomin,
waylaid him and shot him
down. For this willful murder "by
plaine and notorious evidence" he
was hanged on September 30, 1830.

This writer hears there
is now a better chance for two-way
appeasement than at any time in

Mr. Ross, for 20 years head of

traits which perhaps account for
his expedient rather than doctrin
al trend. No mere doctrinaire
would amuse himself by
keeping a copper hall in the ail
with no visible means of support
—just because he loves kilowatts
and likes to see them work.
He was a consulting engineer for
the New York power authority
and the St. Lawrence seaway, a consultant
for PWA power development
and later a member of the SE C before
the President made h im the
Bonneville boss. As a boy, he rode
his bike from Chatham, Ont., to New
York city, to learn pharmacy. He
got a jo b as an apprentice chemist,
but pestling seemed piffling, so
he hit the long grind back to Chath

headed up through Edmonton to the
Alaska gold-fields, and, when dry
land failed him, he made his own
boat and pushed on. In Seattle,
years later, he helped design the

In N azi Put-Out
In Brazil Game
\\T A R R E N L E E P IE R SO N , head
of the Kxport-Import bank, appears
to rate an assist in the Nazi
put-out in Brazil. The big credit
deal, to clear the
trade ways between
the two
c o u n t r ie s , is
widely accepted
as a goose-egg for the Reich.
The young and energetic Mr. Pierson.
who became head of the bank
in 1938, toured the Latin-American
countries last sum m er and fall and
returned with a lot of sizzling new
ideas about hopping up South American
trade, and resisting the totalitarian
drive, by deploying credit
judiciously where it is needed most
to grease thc trade run-around.
When it r im e to Brazil, he got
eager attention from both the
state department and the adm inistration.
as Brazil ia an important
consideration of naval geography
as well as trade. Shouldering
far out into the Atlantic,
with the new fascist threat to
the Canary Islands, it would, If
hostile, pinch us in a narrowing
seaway, with Argentina, on the
whole not so clubby with the
V. S. A., away down under. For
both strategic and commercial
reasons, Brazil is our entrepot to
South America, If we keep on
being neighborly.
In H arvard law school Mr. Pierson
was obsessed with foreign trade
snd directed his studies to practice
in this field. Practicing law in Los
Angeles, his opportunity came in
1934, when he was appointed general
counsel for the Export-Import bank.
In 1936, there was, for h im , a timely
New Deal row, which resulted in
the resignation of George N. Peek
as head of the bank and the upping
of Mr. Pierson.

A QUESTION
Body's Need for Liquids
This precious fluid acts as a solvent
of food materials and makes
possible their d igestion
and absorption.
Since it is an
essential constituent
of the blood, it
helps to transport
nutrients to every
cell—this function
a l o n e requiring
about 10 pounds of
water in constant
circulation. Finally,
it helps to elim inate
waste products
from the body through the
lungs, skin and kidneys.
The daily losses of water from
the body must be replaced regularly
or the consequences may be
extremely serious to health. It
has been shown that headaches,
nervousness and indigestion may
result when the intake of fluids is
diminished below normal requirements.
aroma add greatly to the enjoyment
of other foods and they give
a comfortable feeling of wellbeing.
The stim ulating principle in
these beverages is known as caffein
in coffee, and thein in tea.
Doctors may forbid coffee because
of some abnormality in health
which makes a stimulant undesirable.
But competent authorities
hold that the effects of the
moderate use of coffee by no rm al
individuals may be disregarded.
Neither coffee nor tea, however,
should be given to children. F irst,
because they do not need stimulants,
and second, because the use
of these beverages will tend to
reduce the consumption of m ilk
which is so important to their nutritional
welfare.
Beverages Classified
fh e quantity of water needed by
each person varies with the dietary
and with the season of the
year, much larger amounts being
required when the temperature is
high. But it is generally agreed
that everyone should consume several
glasses of water daily, in addition
to the water obtained from
foods, chiefly fruits and vegetables.
Part of the need is met by
milk, and by coffee, tea, cocoa,
fruit juices and various other
fruit-flavored drinks which add
pleasure to mealtime, serve as
wholesome, between-meal pickme-
ups, and provide a gracious
method of extending hospitality to
guests.
Aside from milk, which belongs
in a classification by itself, and
fruit juices which are consumed
chiefly for their minerals and vitamins,
beverages fall Into two
groups which overlap somewhat:
those that are refreshing and those
that are stimulating.
Guard Against Staleness
The subject of coffee has been
investigated from many angles by
competent scientists, whose findings
should be of interest to homemakers.
The flavor and aroma of
coffee are derived chiefly from a
volatile oil, which is developed
during the roasting process. But
it has been established that this
substance is rapidly lost from the
coffee upon exposure to air. Moreover,
each pound of coffee contains
about two ounces of fixed oil
which m ay become rancid in the
presence of air. These changes
occur whether the coffee is ground
or in the bean.
Since stale, flavorless coffee
may have an adverse effect upon
appetite, it Is important to buy a
product that is protected against
the air, or to choose one that ia
freshly roasted. The homemaker
should also buy coffee in sm a ll
quantities so that it can be used
up quickly once it is opened. After
the coffee has been made, there
may be a further escape of its
flavor and fragrance with both
heat and steam. That is why coffee
should not be allowed to stand,
but should be served the m om ent
it is made, and why it should not
be reheated.
Tea also deteriorates when it is
stored for long periods. It should
therefore be bought in small quantities
and kept in air-tight c o d »
tainers.
Refreshing Beverages
The refreshing beverages in clude
fruit juices, fruitades and
carbonated drinks, such as ginger
ale and sarsaparilla. They are effective
in quenching thirst and
their appetizing flavors encourage
the drinking of generous amounts
of water. They nlso contribute
energy values to the diet in proportion
to ihe amount of sweetening
used in their preparation.
F ruit juices are most frequently
served as an appetizer at break
fast, lunch or dinner. Fruitades
are useful as between-meal drinks
and when entertaining. Children
like to display their hospitality to
friends and this type of beverage,
served with a few crackers or
simple cookies, makes an attractive
snack.
Mothers will find it convenient
and economical to utilize for this
purpose beverage crystals which
come in a variety of fruit flavors
These make wholesome, refreshing
beverages at a m in im um cost;
the amount of sweetening may be
determined by individual preference;
and they are so easily prepared
that children m ay do the
mixing themselves.
“ Did the wind whistle then?”
“ 1 think you heard the stove
pipe.”
Stimulating Beverages
The stimulating beverages are
coffee, tea, chocolate and cocoa.
When made with m ilk , chocolate
and cocoa are rich in nutritive
values, though their fuel value varies
with thc product used. Chocolate
is much richer in fat than
cocoa, and products labeled
“ breakfast cocoa” usually contain
a larger percentage of the natural
cocoa fat than products simply labeled,
“ cocoa.”
The food value of coffee and tea
depends entirely upon the cream
or milk, and sugar with which
they are served. However, they
have an important place in tbe
Questions Answered
Mrs. S. M.— It has been established
that there is a much greater
loss of m ineral salts in cooking
carrots when they are cut in sm a ll
pieces than when they are cut in
large pieces. Mineral losses can
be minimized by cooking this
vegetable whole, just until tender.

sumption la*t year set a new high.
The 1938 figure was 14.38 lbs. per perron,
up 1.34 lb. since 1937.”
Prohibition, high pressure advertising,
reduced prices are reasons for
this boost in coffee drinking, but “ the
nervous national tempo” leads to exci
strive use of all stimulants. It also
may be that when depression nips an
average man’s buying power, he finds
a 5c cup of coffee a sort of emotional
“ersatz” for more expensive things.
That the IJ. S. became a nation of
coffee swizzlers was no more accident
than Great Britain’s taking to tea.
Coffee reached England about 1650
from Arabia, tea about 1857 from
China. In the interval England's great
East India Company let Dutch and
French exporters grab most of the
coffee trade. So British patriots
turned to tea. Later, the East India
Company tried to force its monopoly
on the American colonies under the
notorious Tea Act. So American patriots
held the Boston Tea Party and
turned to coffee.
Today hot coffee is served in 96.4'
of U. S. homes, hot tea in 87.5' r , but
the quantity of coffee drunk is far
greater. While the U. S. has contributed
no coffee ceremony to parallel
the Japanese tea ceremony, it has paid
coffee a typical American tribute: in
Massachusetts in 1865 the percolator
was invented. And nowadays a cornerstone
of economic solidarity between
21 American republics is the
annual purchase of 13,000,000 bags of
coffee— mostly the lower priced coffees
of Brazil, partly the quality coffees of
Colombia, which are frequently used,
as Turkish tobacco is used in cigarettes
for blending purposes.— (Time
Magazine).

Do you enjoy read in g the Ads?
Spring is here and it’s time to change
the oil, and all that sort of thing?
Well, advertising varies with the seasons
and changes with the fashions.
Car companies tantalize me with
tf learning pictures of new models;
food companies tickle my jaded appetite
with luscious pictures of epicurean
delights; and drug companies either
scare me half to death with a picture
of me as I am or thrill me half to
pieces with one of how I can be.
Either I look at “ film” covered teeth
with dejection or I grin delightedly
into a mirror for Behold! a miracle on
my teeth when you-know-what-kindof-
toothpaste began its Bubble Bath!
I am either the life of the party and
the desire of every heart or I am disconsolately
one of the discarded because
“my personal air-conditioning”
ain’t what it aughter be. You see,
today “ Buildings and men have higher
standards. A few years ago there
was no such thinjf as an air conditioned
theatre, office, business building—or
man. Though women worried about
perspiration aura and used a deodorant
to prevent it, men perspired and did
nothing about it except maybe their
regular baths”—but today—up-to-date
buildings and MEN are “ Air Conditioned!”
A certain cigarette used to boast
"not a cough in a carload.” Now a
rosy younjf girl with a duck under her
arm and a cigarette in her fingers
claims: “ It ’s a ducky cigarette with
no quack about it!”
Yes, indeed, advertising trends have
changed when it’s the man who worries
about his BO and the woman who
boosts cigarette sales.
