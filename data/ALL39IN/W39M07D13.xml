FOKTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN, THURSDAY. JULY 1.1. 19.19 NUMBER .15
Legislative Investigations
Unpredictable and unpopular are the
functions of legislative investigating
committees. Every legislative Besson
brings in joint and individual
house resolutions calling for probes of
nearly every description of state department
and commission activities.
Probes are unpredictable because they
seldom arrive at any definite conclusion.
They are unpopular because if
any irregularities are found they are
termed “trumped up charges” and if
nothing is revealed the committee is
accused of “whitewashing.’'
Wisconsin’s 1939 legislature has
more than its share of investigating
resolutions, eleven in all. They ask for
investigations of salaries of employes
in executive positions in state departments
and commissions; of malfeasance
and wastefulness of state departments;
of activities of t ^ department
of agriculture and marl3P; of activities
of the conservation commission;
o f the advertising expenditures of the
conservation commission; of the functions
and duties of the insurance
department; of the drop-off in liquor
tax collections by the tax commission;
of trade barriers and their effect on
Wisconsin business; of drinking on the
University campus; and of the alleged
fluid milk monopoly of distributors in
Wisconsin.
Of the eleven resolutions all save
the last mentioned originated in the
lower house .and but two have been
adopted. The investigation of the
activities of the department of agriculture
and markets is a joint house
investigation, while that of the conservation
department is a single house—
assembly—probe.
Conservation and Agriculture
Because of their varied and many
phases of regulatory and enforcement
activities, the conservation commission
and the department of agriculture
and markets are the most frequent
targets for investigating resolutions.
During 1937-38 the agricultural commission
was investigated for its
alleged laxity in enforcing the oleo
law. This session the chief criticisms
center about milk price control and
cheese grading inspection.
The conservation commission is
accused of many things; that $030 of
the advertising appropriation has been
illegally spent; that its land buying
policy is irregular; and that the game
fu r farm functions to the disadvantage
of the state. To date the conservation
investigation has been a series of
charges and a like series of denials.
The department of agriculture investigation
has revealed nothing. The
meetings of the probing committee
have been held behind closed doors and
there has been no public report.
Oleo, Still the Problem
Still a problem and a much disputed
and debated issue is Wisconsin’s five
year old oleo law, designed to protect
Wisconsin’s butter market within the
state by placing a 15 cents per pound
tax on oleo butter substitutes and requiring
a license of distributors and
retailers.
Industrial manufacturers in the
state claim that retaliatory measures
by buyers in southern states in thc
form of cancelled contracts on Wisconsin
made products has resulted in
large losses for Wisconsin business
and industry. Governor Heil, a Mil
waukee manufacturer, has publicly
stated that he opposes state trade harriers,
and includes the oleo tax. Last
week the legislature received a bill in
troduced by Assemblyman Trego of
Merrill asking repeal of the law.
Last year an Outagamie County
circuit court held that the sale of two
products in a combined package which
when mixed constituted oleomargarine
required a license and tax. Now
comes the problem of the sale of cotton
seed vegetable shortening and the
coloring fluid in separate packages.
Attorney General John Martin has
ruled that such a sale may or may not
require a license. I f the two products
are sold in response to a request for
oleomargarine, then it would require
a license. However, the opinion also
stated that if the products are placed
on the shelf in separate packages, and
if each is sold upon its own merits
without regard to the other, and if no
attempt is made to sell the two together
a* a butter substitute, then no
license would be required,
Oleo Tax Collection*
Reports from the secretary of
state’s office show that the following
amounts have been collected by the
license and tax on oleo for each of the
five years that the law has been in
effect.
1934-35 $ 3.556.62
1935-36 2.242.43
1936-37 55.08
1937-38 1,747.05
1938-39 3,428.27
Recent news stories carried the information
that during the fiscal year
1937-38 only one dollar had been col
lected in license fees. Secretary of
state officials say that the one dollar
figure is incorrect and that the amount
is $1,747.05, as given in their latest
report.
The legislature will, when it acts
upon the Trego bill, write another
chapter and possibly the final one on
the oleomargarine law. Because of
Governor Heil’s dislike for the law it
is possible that the law will be repealed.
O f note is the fact that the 1939-
40 department of agriculture and
markets appropriation contained in
the budget carries no appropriation
provision for enforcing the law.
Cut Auto Fees?
Auto license fees would be cut in
half under a bill engrossed by the senate.
Four Democrats and three Republicans
joined Progressives in advancing
the bill over the objections of
administration forces.
Senator Arthur L. Zimny, Democrat,
who introduced the bill, said it was the
answer to campaign promises made by
all parties of lower license fees. He
said it would mean only a three million
dollar annual loss to the state in
answer to Republican Senator Jesse
Peters’ claim that it would mean a cut
of AVi million in license revenues.
Senator Edward J. Roethe, Republican,
said that while Republicans had
promised fee reductions, they had not
promised a 50 per cent cut. Also pending
action in the senate is a measure
which provides cuts of from $1 to $4
on license fees for cars under 2,799
pounds and a flat $4 cut on cars over
2,800 pounds.
New Regent Board
Senator Roethe’s bill to set up a
new nine-member board of regents for
the University of Wisconsin to replace
the present 15-member board has been
pushed beyond the amendable stage in
the senate and needs only a final passage
vote there before it goes to the
assembly.
The bill empowers Governor Heil,
with the consent of the senate, to appoint
the new board. Terms of mem-

church. The Rev. Palmer A. Wahl,
pastor of First Lutheran church of

Burial was in the church cemetery in
Alban.
Andreas Ole Lindland was bom in
Sonnesogn, Norway, on March 6, 1855.
When he was 13 years old his parents
emigrated to the United States. That
was in 1868 and the family settled on
a piece of land in the town of Alban.
Portage county. Andreas was married
on Ju ly 3, 1880, to Miss Kirstine
Moe, who passed away in 1911. He
was married again in 1912 at Newman
Grove. Nebraska, to Miss Karine Nesse.
Mr. Lindland was a charter member
of the Alban congregation and
took an active part in the building of
the church. He sold his farm in the
town of Alban in 1921 and he and his
family moved the same year to this
village, where they acquired the Pembleton
residence property which has
since been the family home. For the
past several months he had been a
nati* nt at the State Hospital near
Oshkosh, where he passed away at
4:30 o’clock last Sunday morning. His
wife and sons and their families were
on Saturday notified of his serious
condition and they were all at his bedside
when the end came. Besides his
wife, he leaves two sons, Richard and
Gilman, who live in Neenah. Three
brothers and three sisters and a
daughter by his first marriage preceded
him in death.

Mrs. Emily Anderson, of W’ittenberg,
exchanged nuptial vows with Kenneth
Jcrgeson, son of Mr. and Mrs. Clyde
Jorgeson, of Clintonville, at the parsonage
of St. Paul’s Lutheran church
in this village last Saturday afternoon
before the Rev. George Fierke.
The bride wore a princess gown of
white taffeta and a finger tip veil of
tulle and carried a large bouquet of
roses and other summer flowers.
Miss Virginia Mack, of Green Bay,
and Miss Lila Anderson, attending as
bridesmaids, wore taffeta frocks, in
blue and pink, and had wrist bouquets
of sweet peas and forget-me-nots.
The bridegroom was attended by his
brother, Travis Jorgeson, Clintonville,
and Russell Buck, town of Morris.
Following the ceremony, a reception
for 65 guests was held at the home of
the hide’s uncle and aunt, Mr. and
Mrs. Eugene Buck, in the town of!
Morris. The house was decorated for j
the occasion with garden flowers and I
streamers of blue and pink.
Mr. and Mrs. Jorgeson are to reside j
at Clintonville and will be at home to
friends after July 15.
Barn Burns Monday
The barn on the Adolph Drews farm
located two miles east of Wittenberg
was destroyed by fire of unknown
origin Monday afternoon. The roof
was burning in several places when
the fire was discovered. Efforts to
control the blaze by the use of water
and fire extinguishers proved futile,
for sparks fell through into the hay
mow and then the fire was completely
out of control.

Haseltine Re-elected
As School Treasurer
W. D. Haseltine was re-elected as
treasurer of Joint School District No.
3 of the town and village of Wittenberg
in Monday’s election, receiving
89 votes. Opposing him (but not having
his name printed on the ballot)
was George Voelz. who received 48
votes. Three of the 140 votes cast
went to Dr. Earl Gates, a former
member of the board.
About forty people attended the
school meeting in the evening, presided
over by Mr. Haseltine. The
financial report and the budget submitted
for the coming year as published
in The Enterprise last week were
approved in separate motions. Other
routine matters were aso disposed of.
The question of bus transportation
was discussed and the sentiment of
those present seemed to be opposed to
having the school district enter into
such service. Insulation of the high
school building was prop >sed from the
floor. By a rising vote of 24 to 4. the
board was authorized to make such
improvement if and .when they find the
condition of the treasury will permit
it.
The rate of tuition for students outside
nf the district will remain as
heretofore.
Rev. G. F. Fierke expressed appreciation
he and many others in the

the fine work they had done during the

with the building of the new gym and
high school addition.
George Voelz, Harold Kusserow and
George Carmany were selected as the
auditing committee for the ensuing
year.

INTERNATIONAL:
Armaments
What constitutes absolute "ne u trality”
in wartime has never made
itself quite clear. Superficial neutrality
under the U. S. law bans sale
of arms and munitions—“ lethal
weapons”—yet under the amendment
of Ohio’s Rep. John M. Vorys
such indispensable war-making
equipment as trucks and commercial
airplanes m ay be sent abroad.
E arly Ju ly , when the neutrality bill
was making its way through congress,
found the agriculture department
proposing government subsidized
export of cotton in a program
whose chief benefactors would be
aggressive Germany and Japan,
both of whom need cotton to stuff
into their ammunition.
But U. S. participation in dictator
rearm am ent is only part of the picture.
Though France has just
banned shipment of scrap iron to
Germany, though B ritain’s new m inistry
of supply will have the right
SCRAP IR O N SH RA PN EL
British steel, British deaths?
0 ban such shipments, profit-conscious
democracies and dictatorships
have no moral compunctionj
about such things; scrap iron or any
other material of Mars is sold
abroad to the highest bidder until
domestic rearmament demands
that it be kept at home. Samples:
Last month B ritain’s liberal Lord
Davies told how scrap iron and
steel exports from the United Kingdom
to the Reich rose from 4,500
tons in Ju ly , 1938, to 17,000 tons in
August, 21,000 tons in September
(month of the Munich crisis) and
23.000 tons in December.
France gave Germany 350 tons of
pig iron last August when the Czech
crisis was just rising, gave her 19,-
000 tons in September when the crisis
was at its peak, and 75,000 tons
in November. In March, when
Germ any took Bohemia, Moravia
and Slovakia, France still had no
compunctions, selling the Reich
67.000 tons.
Still more revealing are Germ
a n y ’s 1938 foreign trade statistics,
showing that 1,059.800 tons of
G e rm a ny’s total 1,146,027 tons of
1938 scrap iron came from Belgium,
Luxemburg, France, Great
Britain, Holland and the U. S., all
potential enemies. In March, 1939,
the same countries contributed 161,-
344 tons, which would make 1,936,128
tons if the same import level were
maintained throughout the year.
F rom the U. S. in 1938 came 462,782
tons; in March, 1939, came 20,175
tons.
H E A D L I N E R S
D R . JA M E S M ON RO E SMITH
Nine years ago the traveling
president of Louisiana State university
arrived at Baton Rouge
in a Model T Ford and a 35-cent
haircut. Late in Ju n e when he
left for Canada, two New Orleans
banks and one at Baton Rouge
said he had $500,000 of their
funds. The university missed
$118,000 in good bonds.
A follower of the late Huey P.
Long, who set out to build Louisiana
State as
revenge against
Tulane, where he
had been denied
an honorary degree,
Dr. Smith
earned his doctorate
at Columb
ia u n iv e r s i t y
teachers college,
New York, in
1927. Meanwhile
h e s e r v e d 10
y e a r s (1920-30)
as dean of education
at little Southwestern Louisiana
institute.
Dr. Sm ith ’s disappearance climaxed
a stormy career, a feature
of which was his censorship
of the school newspaper in 1934
to protect Huey Long from criticism.
I t is now reported that he
raised his salary from $12,000 to
$18,000 a year without the supervisory
board’s knowledge. Lush
with oil and gas revenues from
the state, busily spending money
on an am azing building program,
the university voted bond issues
on which signatures were allegedly
forged to secure the money
w’ith which Dr. Sm ith is said to
have traded in more than 1,000,-
000 bushels of wheat.

MEDICINE:
Cancer
S tan dard treatment, but no sure
cure for cancer is 200-volt X-ray
treatment. Ten years ago Dr. Albert
Soiland of Los Angeles began
experimenting on anim al and plant
tissues with half-million volt X-rays,
finding no visible difference in the
biological effectiveness of the heavier
ray. Only obvious result was
that higher voltage penetrated deeper,
with less burning of skin. Clinically,
Dr. Soiland found something
else. Reporting at Oslo. Norway,
to the Northern Society for Medical
Radiology, he said hundreds of cancers
have been cured by the heavier
ray after the 200-volt charge had
failed. His conclusion: “ A biological
difference in action must exist
if the final analysis is drawn from
observations based on clinical facts.
PHILIPPINES:
No Feart
World economists have long enumerated
reasons why Ja p a n should
w'ant the nearby Philippine islands,
which even now are undergoing an
orderly withdrawal from U. S. supervision.
But never have m ilitary
strategists told why Ja p a n should
not want the rtiilippines, moreover
why such a conquest would be m ilitarily
and financially impossible.
Such, however, is the opinion of
Gen. Douglas MacArthur, former
U. S. chief of staff and now m ilitary
adviser to the Philippines. Asked
point blank for his opinion, General
MacArthur admitted there were ‘‘so
many imponderables involved I
G E N E R A L MacARTHUR
No prophet, but he has opinions.
would be a fool to play the part
of a prophet,” yet offered an opinion
based on “ broad basic facts.”
The opinion:
Such a war must be brought to the
Philippines, would cost more than
$5,000,000,000 and 500,000 men, would
risk almost certain foreign intervention
by a powerful fleet, and might
not then insure concentration of superior
forces at any vital Philippine
area.
Whether Ja pa n even covets the islands
is doubtful to the general.
Puzzled over such popular beliefs,
he told reporters such ownership
would actually be a strategic weakness
to Japan, splitting the empire
militarily into two parts separated
by broad oceans and with Chinese
enemies between the two parts.
POLITICS:
Invitation
Soon each major political party
must choose its 1940 convention site.
Though both groups look favorably
on Chicago, no city or state could
frame so flowery an invitation as
that received by Democratic Chairman
James A. Farley from the California
legislature:
u}fhereas, California is an ideal state
uithin which to hold such a contention
because of iu adequate contention facili•
ties . . . unsurpassed cuisine . . . best enter*
tainment in ihe U'orld . . . most equable
sprint climate . . . unexcelled vacation attractions
.. . magnificent lakes . . . friendly,
loyal people . . . foremost and most progressive
state in the greatest nation on
earth, notv therefore, be it
"Resolved: That the assembly and sen•
ate of the state of California memorialize
the national Democratic committee . . . to
designate a major city in the state of California
as a place uhere the 1940 Democratic
national contention >hall be held.'*
TERRITORIES:
Paradox
As a newspaper and magazine editor
Dr. Ernest H. Gruening became
an opponent of “ big-stick" policies,
a foe of U. S. colonial acquisition
and general all-around irreconcilable
anti-imperialist. But time
found him entering the interior department
to head the division of territories
and island possessions,
which heretofore maintained jurisdiction
over Hawaii and a few other
territories.
But Ju ly 1 found this anti-imperialist
assuming the most imperialistic
job ever created by the U. S.,
an enlarged division of territories
and islands which smacks of Great
Britain's "colonial office." For the
first time in history all U. S. off-

shore possessions excepting Guam
and Samoa are included under the
division’s jurisdiction. Paradoxically,
Dr. Gruening becomes chief administrator
of colonies whose acquisition
he has m any times attacked.
He also becomes the butt
of “ imperialist” and “ dictator”
charges.
Quitting his job would be one salvation,
but he prefers to stick it
out and continue crusading for liberalism,
meanwhile seeking a solution
for his No. 1 problem child,
Puerto Rico, now applying for statehood
and presenting one of the most
difficult tasks in insular administration.
EUROPE:
August Crisis?
Continental crisis have come with
such regular frequency the past
year that most Americans have become
bored with them, confident no
boil will ever burst. By early Ju ly
this sentiment was also felt in
France and London, despite Nazi
war counsels at H itler’s Berchtesgaden
retreat and mysterious goings-
on in Danzig, which is Germany’s
next goal. No such confidence
was felt by Paris and London officialdom,
however. There were intimations
that the most serious crisis
yet is expected in August, delayed
simply because German and Italian
farmers must harvest their wheat
before going to war. By that time
both Nazi and Fascist war maneuvers
will bring dictator armies to
their peaks.
Neither Premier Edouard Daladier
nor P rim e Minister Neville C hamberlain
will confirm this fear, but
confirmation is needless in view of
preparations:
Britain. Summer leave for the
home fleet has been advanced from
August to Ju ly because of a decision
to hold “ exercises in August.”
More than 400,000 officers and men
of the territorial army (like Americ
a ’s national guard) have been instructed
to pack their furniture and
wind up personal affairs before reporting
for annual training period
in August. A “ white paper” announced
an 89,300-man increase in
the standing army. Meanwhile the
first 34,000 conscripts under the universal
service law were ordered to
report Ju ly 15. Trial “ blackouts”
were planned at strategic points
throughout Ju ly, followed by a big
“ blackout” smothering half of E ngland
August 9 and 10.
France. After telling parliament
of a propaganda plot to split France
and Britain, Temporary Dictator
Daladier recessed his audience for
the summer, but warned that an outbreak
of war was momentarily possible.
hence parliament might be
recalled at a moment’s notice. With
an estimated 3,000,000 armed men
on his borders, M. Daladier placed
the nation on full war footing.

W A S H I N G T O N
H O R O S C O P E
Q t!lZ—Congressional inves.igations
always precede the last legislative
session before an election
year. Forecast in the coming
recess are these highlights:
Monopoly committee hearings;
house committee hearings on
banking and taxes; investigations
of the national labor relations
board and fair labor standards
administration; WPA quiz; Dies
committee on unAmericanism;
civil liberties committee.
DATE—Originally set Ju ly 15,
then advanced to August 3, adjournment
of congress is now unpredictable.
A special session
may result if all “ necessary" legislation
is not passed.
WASHINGTON.—The three-billionodd-
dollar “ lending” program is
destined for hard sledding. It has
all the earmarks of a pork-barrel
bill—in reverse. The political,
though highly uneconomic, merit of
a pork-barrel bill was that by gathering
all the little groups that favored
the different tasty local bits
in it, a majority would be formed
which could triumph over the more
economy-minded legislators.
President Roosevelt and Marriner
S. Eccles, the reserve board chief
who has consistently favored
more and bigger spending to get
this country out of the woods, have
picked up so many little groups of
opposition in their lending bill that
j if it passes at all, even in expurgated
form, it will be almost a miracle.
For instance, take the foreign
loans question. If it faced a vote
on its own merits
alone in either house
or senate it would
probably be beaten.
But there is something
more. Senator
H iram W. Johnson
is very proud of his
name being attached
to the law which forbids
loans to any nations
which have defaulted
on their obligations
to the United
States. Now Senator
Johnson is not given to filibusters.
He has sympathized with lots
of them, but he does not make long,
time-consuming speeches.
But political-minded folks would
rather have almost any other m em ber
of either house against them
I than H iram Johnson, if he happens
j to feel strongly. He has a way of
stabbing a hated bill with a quick
sentence, delivered in his staccato
| manner, that almost always finds
its way into the lead of every newspaper
m an 's story of the debate.
Object$ to Lentling Money
Abroad to Make Work Here
His "P ra is e be to God” after the
i administration's capitulation on the
Supreme court enlargement bill was
! featured in all the newspaper acj
counts next day.
This is merely cited as an ex-
' ample. It happens all the time. He
j has one of the most caustic tongues
j on Capitol Hill, but his caustic say-
! ings are rarely personal.
Johnson, of course, is outraged at
I the idea of lending a lot of the
\ taxpayers' money to nations which
| have defaulted loans— even if they
were not w ar loans. He does not
approve the idea of lending money
abroad to make work here.
Then there is the little matter of
the high-speed toll roads. It comes
within a few weeks after the bureau
of roads submitted an exhaustive
study of this whole situation to congress,
a study which showed that
not even the most promising of thc
superhighways could be expected
to pay interest on more than a fraction
of its cost.
Adding to the weakness is that
there is not'even one feature which
appeals to the economy bloc, whereas
the whole, thing stirs up those
who fought the idea of increasing
the federal national debt limit.
Making Gestures of Good
W ill Toward the La Follettes
It is easy to underestimate the
political importance, especially
looking toward the now almost certainty
that Franklin D. Roosevelt
will seek a third term, of the recent
administration gestures of good will
toward the La Follettes. It just
may turn out that Wisconsin’s 12
electoral votes will mean the d ifference
between four more years
of Roosevelt and a Republican President.
Of course nothing will m ake much
difference if the hope of the Republicans
that the tide has turned
j against the New Deal is based on
| reality. But that is fa r from a cer-
| tainty. Indeed recent polls would
j seem to indicate that the ups and
downs of Roosevelt’s popularity re-
| semble a corkscrew more than the
| straight line the Republicans like to
project.
Actually, in 1938, the Democrats
carried the country—as fa r as electoral
votes are concerned. That
is they carried enough states, had
there been a presidential election,
to have elected their ticket.
At a recent Washington dinner
party a very prominent V irginian
declared, over the coffee, that if
Roosevelt ran for a third term the
Old Dominion would go Republican.
That particular gentleman is certainly
far better qualified than the
writer to judge Virginia sentiment,
but the writer does not believe he
is correct. It may be recalled that
Virginia, North Carolina. Florida,
Texas and every one of the border
states went for Herbert Hoover in
1928, but it is mighty difficult to
prove from that fact that they may
do so again in the near future.
No Religious Issue Nor
Prohibition Problem Now
In the first place, there was the
religious issue, which incidentally
was p rim a rily responsible lo r Herbert
Hoover’s carrying New York
as well as the southern states in
question.
There will be no religious issue to
drive the Southern and border states
away from the Democratic party if
Roosevelt runs again.
Prohibition, which did figure some
in 1928, will not be an issue.
But also important, though not
generally appreciated, is that the
men who led the revolt against
Sm ith in the South, almost without
exception, committed political suicide.
So it is really a fa ir assumption,
and based on the best possible
political logic, to count all the southern
states for Roosevelt even if the
third term issue is involved.
There are 135 electoral votes in
A lab am a, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,
North and South Carolina, Tennessee.
Texas and V irginia, Maryland,
Missouri, and Oklahoma would
give 34 more, m aking the total 169.
In the so-called Republican swing
of 1938 New York went Democratic
by more than 500,000 for both senators,
both representatives at large,
in fact for every state-wide office
except governor. California also
went overwhelmingly Democratic.
These two states, with Wisconsin,
roll up 81 more electoral votes
which Roosevelt would not have to
be unduly optimistic to count as
sure for h im—if the La Follettes
are with h im . That makes 250, and
he would have to pick up only 16
scattering electoral votes to win the
266 necessary for election!
La Follette Amendment to
Income Tax Lau' Gains Favor
The La Follette amendment to
the income tax law, reducing exemptions,
bringing in a much broader
base, and of course increasing
the tax every individual would pay
because his exemption would be
less, is going to become law eventually.
F or the second time the senate
has approved the idea, and then
backed away from it for purely temporary
emergency reasons. This
time the first vote was 39 to 37 for
the amendment. But when it was
realized that the amendment had
been adopted, and that this would
delay passage of the tax bill until
there could be a perhaps lengthy
conference with the house. Senator
M illard E. Tydings of Maryland
changed his vote. This resulted in
a tie, which defeats any amendment.
But the point is that the government
must have the money. There
is no possibility that government
spending will decrease anything like
enough to bring receipts and expenditures
within striking distance
in the next two years. It is now a
demonstrated fact that there is a
majority sentiment in the senate for
the La Follette idea.
Senator Robert M. La Follette has
been battling for five years for this
tax law change. He
is one of the very
few men in public
life who believes in
government spending—
big spending—
but believes that the
taxpayers ought to
know they are paying
for it. Most
other public figures
have been trying for
that same five years
to work out ways and
means of raising all
the money possible without the taxpayers
knowing they are being
burnt. Or, to put it more accurately,
without the small-income
group of taxpayers knowing they
are helping pay the freight.
Many People Not Aware
They Are Paying Taxes
As an evidence of how successful
they have been there is the am azing
result of a recent poll which
shows that one-fourth of all the people
asked—in the usual G allup
cross section—did not know they
were paying any taxes, and that 40
per cent, two out of five, of the
smaller-income group did not know
they were paying any!
But a gradually increasing num ber
of senators has come to the
conclusion that the voters should
know about taxes. Some even go
further, to insist that knowledge
that he is paying an income tax to
the federal government makes a
m an a better citizen, gives him a
sense of responsibility, and will
make him take more interest in
voting.
President Roosevelt until this
summer has always opposed the La
Follette idea. But the President
has now come around to the Wisconsin
senator’s view, which leaves,
as a matter of fact, very little difference
between their economic theories,
though the La Follettes have
never let the Democratic party organization
get away with much in
Wisconsin. As for instance when
they fought the re-election of Senator
F. Ryan Duffy.
Roosevelt once told a friend—this
was about four years ago—that "the
La Follettes are our kind of people.”
Ju s t recently Attorney General
F rank Murphy extolled the whole
La Follette fam ily, holding that they
were one of America's best political
traditions.

When there’s something wrong
with you. the first rule Is: get at
the cause. If you are constipated,
don’t endure it first and cure It
afterward. Find out what's giving
you the trouble.
Chances are it’s simple if you
eat the super-refined foods most
people do: meat, white bread,
potatoes. It ’s likely you don’t get
enough “bulk” And “bulk” doesn’t
mean a lot of food. I t ’s a kind of
food that isn’t consumed in the
body, but leaves a soft “bulky”
mass in the intestines and helps
a bowel movement.
If this is your trouble, you
should eat a natural •‘bulk’’ producing
food-such a one as the
crunchy, toasted, ready-to-eat
cereal-Kellogg’s All-Bran. All-
Bran Is the ounce of prevention
that’s worth a pound of emergency
relief. Eat it every day,
drink plenty of water, and "Join
the Regulars.” All-Bran is made
by Kellogg’s in Battle Creek.
To Spend Wisely
A fool may make money, but it
takes a wise m a n to spend it.

“No, no,’* Ju n e insisted. “ You
were always so sweet to Mother.
You and G ra n dm a both."
“ It was not what we did to her/*
the old m an said. “ It was what we
permitted to be done.*' And he
asked after a moment, astonishingly:
“ June, will you take me some
day to see the m an who lives in
the cabin by the pond?”
“ Uncle J im ? ” she exclaimed, »urprised
and puzzled.
“ You call h im th a t? ” the old m an
asked.
“ He likes me to,** she confessed.
“ I think he is a good m a n ," said
Grandpa Hurder slowly. “ I have
been wrong. I mean to tell h im so.”
June hesitated, deeply puzzled;
but she only said slowly: “ I don’t
know where he is now. He’s gone.’*
The old m an looked at her, she
thought, in something like dismay
at this intelligence, while she explained.
She had seen Uncle J im at her
mother’s funeral, in the undertake
r’s little chapel where frugally the
services were held, and again later
in the cemetery. He was decently
dressed, so that she hardly recognized
h im in this unaccustomed sobriety
of garb. She saw h im watching
her, and wished to smile, but
that would not under the circumstances
have been seemly.
She had gone next day to his cabin
in the wood, only to find it closed,
secured; but there was a note on
the door addressed to her. It promised
that he would come back soon;
but he had not yet returned . . .
During the fortnight after her
mother died, and for the first time
in her life, Ju ne began to be happy.
The girl thought this was a strange
thing, a shameful thing; yet it was
true. For the world began to smile,
and in surprising ways!
C lint was tender to her, but so
were others too. The world, after
her mother’s death, turned in so
m any ways a new countenance toward
June. Mrs. Bowdon gave her
a heavy sym pathy; Aunt Evie told
her that she was a brave fine girl.
R a b made her smile sometimes
with a jesting word; and her cousin
Asa began to pay her, with a quizzical
light in his eye, certain mysterious
attentions. He brought home
one day, smuggling it into the house
at dusk, a fiat parcel.
“ Don’t open it here,** he warned
her. “ And don’t let anyone see it.
Take it up to your room. Try it on.
I think it w ill fit all right. Try it
in front of your mirror. Try doing
your hair some other way.’*
The parcel, she discovered, contained
a gown different from any
she had ever worn before, the skirt
dismayingly shorter than the anklelength
Mrs. Bowdon’s strict comm
and had long since imposed. June
was a little terrified at her own aspect
in the m irro r; but by and by
interest banished terror. There
were unseemly lumps which marred
her contours here and there, but
when, valorously experimenting, she
removed her underclothing and put
on the new dress again, these lumps
had disappeared and left smooth
and gracious lines.
June hugged this secret happiness
till Asa found a chance to ask her
whether the gown fitted. She told
h im then:
“ Yes, perfectly. I don’t see how
you knew the size.**
“ I ’ve an accurate eye,** he assured
her.
She almost laughed under her
breath. “ I can’t imagine you going
into a store and buying things like
that.”
He said with an amused promise
in his tones: “ I ’ll surprise you
ag a in .” And he w’as as good as his
word, bringing her one day another
parcel. When she opened this one.
she was enraptured; but it was
hours before she ventured to try on,
even behind the bolted door of her
room, the astonishing garments
therein contained; and it was days
before she risked wearing some of
them, soberly concealed beneath the
fusty dark dress which was her usual
garb in the house.
She asked Asa one day why he
had fetched her these secret lovely
things; and he said with • smile
in his eyes:
“ A girl has a right to them, June.
I f you ever want to impress some
young m an, ju st wear that dress.”
She colored richly, and wondered
whether he knew about Clint, and
dared not ask for fear of his reply.
Yet this was a delicious fear; she
hugged it rapturously.
She could not wear the new dress.
It would be seen. But she wore the
undergarments Asa had given her,
under her accustomed garb. And
she saw Clint more and more often.
One day they had appointed to
meet by the river, and June was
waiting by the knoll above the
stream when the canoe appeared.
She saw in a faint dismay that Clint
was not alone, and thought of flight;
then she recognized in C lint’s passenger
the kindly old man who had
come with Clint to Uncle J im ’s cabin
that first day.
Clint, when they landed, made
good-humored apologies: “ Mr. Tope
j r a f bound to come along. June.**
he said. “I told h im three’s a
crowd; but I couldn’t get rid of him.
We’ll maroon h im here and go on
upstream, you and L ”
But the Inspector said, smiling at
the girl on the bank above h im : “ I
suspected that C lint was up to something,
coming out here so much.
How are you? I met you one day,
remember?**
She did remember, and she said
so, conscious already of that feeling
of liking and trust which Tope
could when he chose inspire. But
she said to Clint: “ I can’t go up
the river today. I have to be back
soon. Grandpa Bowdon isn’t well today.
They might need me. But we
can sit here for a while.”
She tried to recall, afterward,
whether Tope had asked her any
questions that day; but she could
not be sure of a single direct inquiry.
Yet she had found herself
telling h im about the night her
mother died; about the anagrams,
“ I ’m excited,** she confessed.
and her mother’s headache, and the
fact that there was no m ilk in the
ice-chest, so that Aunt Evie had to
go next door—everything.
Tope nodded, and C lint came to
her side. “ I ’ll walk a little way
with you,” he said. So she bade
Tope good-by, uncertainly, and she
and Clint w'ent up the slope together.
When they were out of hearing,
she said with something like a shudder:
“ I ’d almost forgotten about that
night.” She looked at Clint squarely.
“ Clint, what is it? What did he
wrant? Who is he?”
But Clint told her reassuringly:
“ He’s all right. A fine old fellow.”
The young m an chuckled. “ You
see, he m arried Miss Moss, and I
guess she sent him out to—look you
over, June. She’s almost like my
own mother, you know.”
He was able in the end to reassure
her. Before they parted, still
out of sight of the houses on tHfe
hill, they planned to meet next
morning at Uncle J im ’s cabin in
the wood. Then she told h im goodby,
and saw something in his eyes,
and guessed what was in his m ind ;
and she waited, gracious and consenting.
But in the end he only
clasped her hand and said:
“ In the morning, th e n !”
She went away from him up the
slope, smiling to herself. It had
been easy to read the impulse in
his eyes; she had seen and welcomed
it. She had belonged to him
in her thoughts long ago. Yet she
could smile now at his restraint,
sure of him as she was of herself.
Their hour would come.
When she reached the house, it
was to learn that Grandpa Bowdon
had died half an hour before.
CH A PT E R IX
June, to her own astonishment,
wept for Grandpa Bowdon as she
had not wept for her mother. His
going touched her deeply; and she
went to her room and stayed there
for a while alone. Then Asa
knocked at her door, and when she
opened, he knew how to comfort
her.
“ He was ready to go, June,** he
said. “ Don’t feel badly. And—it
was just like snapping a string. No
hurt, no pain.”
And he bade her come downstairs.
“ The old folks need you,” he urged.
“ You and R ab and I, we’ve got to
carry them over the hump, you
know.”
She wished suddenly, desperately,
to see Clint, to be with him now;
but since she could not, she smiled
at Asa, and dried her tears, and
went down with him, her head high
and steady. Through the rest of that
afternoon and evening, she carried
her share of the burden here . . .
The appointed hour was not yet
come next morning, when June
slipped away to the woods to meet
Clint; but he would have seen the
report of Mr. Bowdon’s death, would
know she needed him.
When she came through the sunlit
woods, up the path to the cabin on
the knoll, he was there as she expected.
He saw her approaching and
was swift to meet her.
June stood still as he drew near,
and she was trem bling and shaken.
He came toward her, his hands outstretched;
and without knowing
how, or caring, she was in his arms
—and happy there.
“ I shouldn’t have stayed with you,
yesterday,” she said, after a long
time. “ I might have seen him
again, if I ’d come home.”
He urged: “ June, June, you
couldn’t have helped. And you liked
being with me, were happy. That’s
what he’d have wanted for you.”
“ I never was really afraid before,”
she whispered. “ Not for m yself.
But I am now, Clint. Oh, I
am now. Afraid for me and you.”
“ I ’m going to take you aw ay,” he
cried. “ Away from all this h e re !”
“ You can’t,” she protested.
“ G randpa and G randm a H urder—
they just have to have me there.”
Yet she agreed by and by to meet
him that night, after the others
should all be abed.
They had supper before dark, i n
Ju n e ’s kitchen. R a b had stayed
with G randm a Bowdon while Aunt
Evie ate her supper; but when his
mother relieved h im , he came back,
and June served h im , and he said
approvingly:
“ You’re carrying a load, June.
Good lass. I wish I could give you
a hand.”
“ I t ’s a woman’s business,” she
told h im . “ You do more with them,
keep them going.”
“ I ’ve got to leave them tonight,**
he confessed. “ I ’m due in court in
Providence in the morning. I t ’s just
an appearance, but the judge down
there is a crank. And I have to
see m y client tonight.”
When he had finished, he went
home wTith Uncle Justus; but half
an hour later he stopped in again.
June was washing the last dishes.
“ F ather’s gone to sleep in his
c h air,” he told her, smiling. “ He’ll
wake up and put himself to bed
by and by. I ’m going over to say
good night to Mother and G rand m
a .”
June nodded, intent upon the
dishes, intent upon her own
thoughts. It was half after seven.
C lint had said he would be waiting,
a little distance down the road, at
eight; but she had no hope of coming
to h im so soon. Grandpa and
G randm a Hurder were in the sitting-
room; and once she looked in
on them. They had not heard her
approach; and Grandpa Hurder was
just leaning over to pat G ra n dm a’s
hand where it lay on the arm of the
ch air; June watched and her throat
swelled w’ith tears unshed. And then
Asa came in. “ Any water hot,
J u n e ? ” he asked. “ I ’ve got to have
a cup of tea.” He sat down while she
put the kettle on the stove, talked
to her casually till it boiled. She
found a tea-ball, and he brought a
milk-bottle half empty from the icechest,
and poured a little m ilk into
the cup.
“ There isn’t any cream/* she
said. “ I ’m sorry.”
“ M ilk ’s all right if you use enough
of it,” he assured her, smiling in
that dry way he had. “ That’s the
way with most things, June. Too
little’s starvation; too much is as
bad. But enough’s all right.” He
drank in little sips, watching her.
“ You’re like a rosebud, swelling as
it gets ready to bloom.”
And he declared: “ Hey, you’re
blushing, child. High tim e you
heard some pretty things about yourself,
if your own cousin -can make
you blush with a compliment.” He
put his arm around her, kissed her
cheek. “ How about this Jervies fellow?”
He saw her start with dismay,
and laughed, and promised: “ I
won’t say a word.’’ He disappeared.
Later Aunt Evie came into the
kitchen. “ Those old folks won’t
sleep a wink,” she said gently. “ I ’m
going to give them some m ilk .” She
saw the bottle where Asa had left it,
and poured the ’ milk into a stewpan,
scratched a match.
June was suddenly cold with remembered
terror. She told herself
she was a fool, a fool, a fool. People
had drunk warm m ilk before!
R a b came in from out of doors,
wet with the increasing rain; he
crossed to where Aunt Evie stood
by the stove and embraced her.
“ 'Night, Mother,” he said. “ I ’ll be
back by noon tomorrow.”
“ The funeral is at four,” she told
him evenly.
“ I know,” he assented. “ I ’ll be
here.” He grinned at June. “ Good
night, kid.”
Aunt Evie poured the m ilk into
two glasses, and June went with
her into the other room.
The girl was full of a great tenderness
for these old folk. Under
Aunt E vie’s calm insistence they
sipped their m ilk obediently; they
set the empty glasses by; they lay
down to sleep like children, side
by side.
June took the glasses, started toward
the kitchen to wash them. Behind
her she heard Aunt Evie say:
“ No. I ’ll leave the windows
closed. It might rain in. And you
don’t need any air. You’ll be asleep
so soon.”
She was always thus calmly bent
upon having her own w a y ; when she
came back into the kitchen, she
looked at the girl keenly. “ You all
right, Ju n e ? ” she asked.
“ Oh, yes,” June told her guardedly.
“ You must go to bed,” Aunt Evie
directed. “ As soon as you are done
here. Good night, child.”
Her hands flying, she slipped out
of her clothes, changed swiftly into
the dress Asa secretly had given
her. She stood for a few minutes
before the mirror, busy with her
hair. At last she was satisfied. Some
one radiant and lovely looked back
at her from the mirror there.
She turned out the light at last,
and in the darkness descended to
the lower hall. She found a heavy
coat and drew it on, then opened the
front door.
A gust of rain wet her cheek, and
she remembered another night when
she had thus gone running to meet
Clint. But then she did not know he
was waiting. It was deeply contenting
to be sure tonight that he would
meet her here.
“ Darling I You’re shaking all
over!”
“ I ’m excited/* she confessed, i
laughing softly. “ I—never did this j
before, and I ’ve got a new dress i
on.” He kissed her again, and she
confessed: “ And I thought of the |
night Mother died. It rained then j
too, remember. So I was scared.” \
“ Not scared now,” he urged, and j
held her close.
“ Never with you/* she promised
him.
So presently he put the car in
motion, allowing it to coast silently j
down the hill. Another car overtook .
them from behind and passed at ;
speed.
Neither Clint nor June would re- j
member, afterward, much about the j
motion-picture they saw that eve- ;
ning. In the d im obscurity of the
theater, their eyes were much more !
often turned toward each other than :
toward the screen. And after a
time Clint whispered: “ Are you liking
this? I think it ’s d u ll.”
She smiled at him . “ I don’t think !
it’s d u ll,” she said. “ You see, it’s
aimost the first one I ever saw.**

Magic and Romantic World of Childhood
Sun in the sky. The oak-stained
autum n sky. Wind in the sassafrassprouts.
The great skies that sweep
over the W-Hollow and the stream
sings a song: “ It was when you
w’ere young here that the hollow
looked like a fairyland to you. It
was the scene of your childhood.
You can remember the m artins
around the boxes in early spring
fighting the English sparrows. You
remember Uncle Mel used to throw
clods out of the garden at the sparrows
and try to run them out for
the martins. You remember the bee
stands under the plum trees and
the bees working on the white plum
blossoms!
“ You remember the flags by the
W-Branch in white, purple and yellow
blossoms and the bees working
on them. You remember the smell
of the hot young corn in the little
bottoms—and you remember the
watermelon patch and the creek
where you left your clothes when
you went in swimming by the sycamore.
“ You owned the hills then— all of
the W-Hollow—but you didn’t have a
deed for those wooded acres with its
m illions of wild flowers and *ts
foxes, rabbits, squirrels, turtles and
terrapins. It was a heaven here to
you. The sun came over the tim bered
hills in the morning—ran
down a blue pathless sky and
dragged a patch of red in the long
summer evenings over the green
chestnut trees on the ridge.
“ You remember it was heaven to
you, a paradise of earth where there
was poetry on the ground, the nodding
flowers, the green hair of April!
It was a heaven of childhood with
the log shack and tumbling barns
and cornfields. But time came by
| and stole that far-away fairyland

Escaped Deeds

Robert Browning.
When fishermen have secured a catch they return to Nassau where
sponges are dried out anti placed on sale at an auction similar to a
southern tobacco auction in the United States. Actual drying process
is shown above. Sponges are buried under weeds and straw to dry out
in the sun.
Since the unique sponge can bo classed neither with the “metazoa** or
the "protozoa” many zoologists place it in a special subkingdom known
as porifera. Sponges may range in size from a p in s head to masses
several feet high, and vary in weight from a grain to more than 100
pounds.

bers are distributed over a period of
nine years, thus allowing future governors
to appoint no more than two
regents each.
The Progressive minority strongly
opposed the bill, but only succeeded in
having one amendment, which prohibits
the appointment of more than
two regents from any one county,
adopted. Also adopted was an amendment
which removed a provision of
the bill that at no time shall a majority
of the regents be of the same
political party.
Capitol Notes
Governor Heil has signed into law
the measure which allows deduction of
federal inheritance and estate taxes
before computing the state inheritance
tax levy. He has vetoed a bill which
would have provided a general pension
system for all school employes
other than teachers, and another which
would have prohibited gasoline stations
from giving trading stamps with
gas purchases.
Voyta Wrabetz, a member of the
state industrial commission for the
past 124 years and chairman of the
body for the past 6 years, has been reelected
chairman. Other commissioners
are Harry Burczyk and C. L. Miller,
both recently appointed by Governor
Heil.
The removal of 240 of the University
of Wisconsin’s 700 telephones has
been ordered by President Dykstra.
It is estimated that the move will save
the University about $6,000 annually.
The assembly concurred with the
senate in a bill which enables county
boards to set up civil service and pension
systems if they desire. The bill
permits the state bureau of personnel
to assist counties in setting up civil
service systems with the cost being

IT’S TRUE!

Pilots Lead the League
The Pilots, behind the very effective
pitching of Krull, defeated the Wausau
Athletics by a score of 4 to 1, thus
avenging the defeat suffered earlier in
the season.
Krull was master of the situation at
all times, allowing the Athletics but
three hits and should have had a shutout
except for some bad errors.
Wausau scored their lone run in the
1st inning on M. Etzkin's double on an
infield out and an error by Gunderson.
The Pilots scored three runs in thr
fifth on singles by Krull and Arnold
an error on Coyle’s grounder by I
Etzkin and a squeeze play with
Schoepke at bat. The other run was
scored in the eighth when Schoepke
singled, forced out by Vance. Vance
was sacrificed to second by Pukall,
stole second and scored on Storm’:
single.
The fielding play of the day was
Arnold’s stop of the ball hit by Smith
in the 8th inning.
A fairly large crowd attended the
game. Next Sunday Edgar plays here
and a good game is assured. The
Pilots plan on staying in first place.
Come out and help then^ stay there.
Fisher, Edgar pitcher, pitched a one
hit game against Wausau on July 2,
and last Sunday Edgar beat the strong
Eland team 6 to 1, behind the effective
pitching of Fisher.

A certain man who has recently remarried
went to his former home town
to get his two small sons.
As they settled themselves in the
car for the drive, the older boy turned
to his father:
“ Now let me see, daddy,” he tried
to remember out loud, “What is our
new wife’s name?”

Did you notice that Governor Wilson
of Iowa granted Minnesota authorities
custody of Bernard Storck, who was in
jail in Emmetsburg, Iowa, because Mr,

Mr. Storck will face charge:

A young matron who is expecting
her first baby has received instructions
from her doctor to take calcium
as a preventative of tooth decay.
The other day she was with a friend,
the mother of a couple of children,
who was amazed to see the young
woman chewing very, very slowly.
“Why are you chewing that stuff so
slowly,” the other woman asked.
“Why, it gives my teeth more time
to absorb the calcium,” came the
reply.

He: “ My, what a beautiful arm you
have.”
She: “Yes, I got that playing handball.”

Two colored porters were discussing
some new general orders. One inquired
what was meant by “courtesy and
tact,” something which was to be
applied to patrons, and this was the
answer Sam gave:
“Ah burst into a bath room one day
in a hurry, and dere wuz a lady sittin’
in de tub; ah bows and sez ‘Excuse
me, sir,’ and backs out. Now when ah
sed, ‘Excuse me,’ dat wuz courtesy;
but when ah sed, ‘sir,’ dat wuz tact.

C A RD OF THANKS
We sincerely thank neighbors and
friends for their kind sympathy and
assistance in our bereavement, the
death of our beloved mother, Mrs.
Pauline Iverson; especially do we
thank the Rev. Wahl for his kind
words, E. R. Dobbert, funeral director,
for his thoughtful service, the ladies
who sang, the organist, those contributing
flowers and memory wreaths,
those who gave the use of cars at the
funeral, and those who furnished food.
Children of Mrs. Pauline Iverson.
Badgers Go Haywire
In a game that should have been a
close contest at Edgar Sunday. Eland
played their worst game of the season.
In contrast to their record chalked
up during the first half of the season,
leading in hitting and fielding, a few
more games like the last two will
show them in close proximity to the
tail-enders.
Brace up Badgers— let’s go!

in the use of his legs that he could
get about in a wheel chair. He is
still receiving treatments at the hospital
and gaining ground in his unusually
optimistic and determined
fight for recovery. His fiancee was a
daily visitor during all the time he
was confined to the hospital and endeared
herself to everybody in her
beautiful devotion to him in his affliction.

H E A D L I N E S F R O M THE LI VES
OF P EOP L E LI KE Y O U R S E L F I
Ghost at the Door”
He l l o e v e r y b o d y :
You know, boys and girls, Old Lady Adventure is the
most democratic female in the world. She doesn’t confine her
attentions to any particular class of people, but visits her favors
•n all alike. Why, kings and queens have had adventures, and
so have doctors, lawyers, cab drivers and preachers.
Today I ’ve got a yarn from a dentist—Dr. Robert Lentz of
Danville, 111.
This adventure happened to Doc along about the summer of
1912, and in those days he was living in Williamson county, near
Wolf Creek, 111. That’s down near the Ozark ridges and in 1912
there was some pretty lonely country in that neighborhood.
Doc knew, because he used to ride through some of it
pretty regularly. He was courting a girl who lived about
five miles from his home and he used to ride out there on
horseback, along a winding road that was almost impassable in places
because of the thick growth on either side.
That road led down into a place known as Big Grassy Creek bottom,
and that bottom was m idw ay between his home and his g irl’s house.
There was a ford across the creek, and near the ford, an old tumbledown
church that hadn’t been used for upwards of 50 years.
Woman Burned to Death in Bygone Days.
Near the church was an old chimney—all that was left of a house
that people told strange stories about. According to one tale a woman had
been burned to death when that house took fire.
There was something eerie about the old church and the old
chimney. Doc used to feel shivery when he passed them riding
home a t two o'clock in the m orning. But one night he made the
mistake of going into that church, and then—
I t was one dark night when Doc was coming back from a date.
It had started to rain ju st after he left—a thin drizzle at first.
But, as he rode along, he heard the rumble of thunder and the rain
began com ing down harder. He had reached the bottom then, and the

church would afford shelter of a sort. Doc tied his horse to a sapling,
and plunged through the underbrush to the door.
The church was all but fallen down. It leaned over crazily to one |
side as if it had been pushed over by some giant hand into a great p arallelogram.
The windows were out and the floor was partly gone, but
guided by intermittent flashes of lightning, Doc worked his way forward
to a point near the rostrum, where the roof was good and the rain
d id n 't come through. The rain d id n ’t show any signs of letting up, so
Doc lay down on a front bench to go to sleep.
Hunch Makes Him Stay Awake.
"1 lay there about 15 minutes,” he said, “ when something
caused me to open my eyes and look at the doorway at the other
end of the church. Lightning flashed just then— flashed just
enough to enable me to see d im ly through the door. Something
told me to stay awake and, with sleepy eyes I gazed at that door
inspecting it each time the lightning would perm it me.
“ I heard a twig break outside, and could tell that my horse
was uneasy. I felt the h air rise on the back of my neck, and my
heart began to beat faster. It seemed that it would be hours
before the lightning flashed again to tell me what m ight be
there, and in the meantime I straightened up just as quietly as
I could.”
And along about then there entered Doc’s mind the thought that
this old church might be haunted. There was that old chimney—charred
rem nant of the house in which a woman had burned to death. And as
if that wasn’t enough. Doc began thinking of the countless people who
m u st have been buried from that old church—whose bodies must have
lain in their pine coffins before that same rostrum near which he
was lying now. Those thoughts were running through Doc's m ind then,
suddenly, lightning flashed again.
And this tim e Doc saw something in the doorway. It was a human
fo rm of some sort, standing there with arm s outstretched, touching both
sides of the door. “ Now,” says Doc, “ I wanted to m ake my exit. I
began to get ready to do so, but how was I going to go about it? The
only door was blocked, and the windows were too high up. I waited
anxiously for the next flash of lightning.
“ It came, and my ghostly visitor was disclosed standing in
the doorway looking at me. It was plainly silhouetted and it
seemed to be an old woman with matted, twisted hair hanging
down to her shoulders, no hat, no shoes, and wearing some
sort of a sack apron.
Lightning Reveals the Thing Coming at Him.
"She moved with as little noise as the spirit Itself. Could it possibly
be • spirit? I couldn’t move. How was I going to get out? Was the
Thing coming closer? To m y disordered imagination, it seemed as il
it was. What would it do when it discovered me? Would it block my
entrance? Would it take out after me? A ll those things I anticipated
before the next flash of lightning. When it came, the Thing was about
two feet closer, coming onward with outstretched arm s I”
Still there was no sound. The apparition had advanced noiselessly.
In tbe darkness before the next flash Doc could imagine cold, clam m y
lingers on his face.
"N ow ,” he says, “ 1 decided tt was tim e to move. I slipped
up slowly, hoping to get past the Thing before the next lightning
disclosed me. I reached the position that I thought was
by her side, and then came another flash. I jum ped, and yelled
out loud. She followed suit with a yell equally as intense and
made a grab at me. But too late!
“ Ju st one ju m p and I was outside the door, running to m y horse
and off like a streak. I believe if Tom Mix could have seen me ride
he'd have envied m e.”
And what was the Thing that Doc saw in the doorway? Well, the
next day Doc heard a report that an aged insane woman had escaped
from the Anna asylum not far away. And that was Doc’s ghost.

EW Y O R K .—As Andre Maurois
becomes an “ im m o rta l,” it
would seem that there ought to be
honorable mention, or at least a
simple garland
of some kind,
for Mme. Maurois.
H e r e a
few weeks ago,
he explained how his wife, also a
person of distinction, learned typing
and stenography to keep his script
flowing smoothly and legibly to the
publishers. He writes only in longhand,
said to be quite as cramped
and illegible as that of Horace
Greeley, and she alone of all mortals
can translate it. Seat No. 35
in the French academy might still
be vacant but for Mme. Maurois.
He was born Em ile Herzog, In
Rouen. His literary divagation
was the first short-rut to im m o rtality
in a line of ancestral woolen
drapers reaching back to the
year 900 A. D. He was a bachelor
of arts at 15 and a doctor of
philosophy at 18. He began
work In his father's factory, but
got right on the job as a philosopher
and literateur, so. when he
was assigned to the British as
an interpreter in the World war,
he could fill them in on Hyron,
Shelley and Keats, and did so.
Later he explained Disraeli to
the English, and. around the
clubs, they bit their pipe-stems
and admitted that this French
chap knew a lot of things they
hand 't even suspected. “ Ariel,
the Life of Shelley” put h im in
the big literary tournament in
1923, where he has been ever
since.
He is slight in stature, dapper
and fastidious, with his thinning
gray hair deployed carefully left and
right, gesturing only cautiously with
the sensitive hands of an artist. He
has an acute, skeptical mind, interested
in politics only in its historic
sweep. He weighs words like
an apothecary and it is as a craftsm
an and finished wordsmith that he
qualifies for the academy. With
keen insight, he has experted America
on his numerous visits here,
clocking us through the valley of
despond. His latest appraisal found
us moving out of national adolescence
into fully rational, adult statehood.
He hopes for the best, but is
not a fuzzy optimist. The “ decline
of the humane ideal,” he thinks, is
the most disquieting trend of the
modern world.

Cowbird Unfriendly
The cowbird is not only a wild
bird but is totally lacking in a social
conscience. Cowbirds do not even
build nests. They deposit their eggs
in others’ nests and leave the upbringing
of the young to other birds.
“ Like the European cuckoo it leaves
all fam ily care to others,” writes
an ornithologist in "B ird s of America.”
He continues: " I t might well
serve as the emblem of free love."
Golden Egg Goose
Jacob Putm an. Bellevue, Iowa, j
believes he has the goose that laid |
the golden eggs, and here's why:
Since last spring the goose has laid
more than 200 eggs and for 10 days
in October averaged two a day. In
addition, the goose laid 21 eggs
while she was sitting on a nest
in the hatching period. She started
with a nest of 16 eggs; ended
with a brood ot 37.

F am ily pride in an athletic son
can reach great heights, but it was
equalled by the partisanship of one
father for the local team in which
his son played scrum-half.
When an important match was
being played some distance from
home, he asked his son to wire the
result.
That evening the telegram came,
bearing the curt message: “ Collar
bone and one rib broken.”
“ Yes, yes,” exclaimed the father,
impatiently, “ but he doesn’t say
who won.”

Refrigerator Meal*
I t ’s a smart stunt to get meal
preparation out of the way in the
cool of the morning. Knowing that
dinner’s ready and
practically waiting
to be served
helps you to look
and feel cool,
calm and collected,
and it leaves
you free for “ vacationing" during
the hot hours of the day.
Here’s a menu that can be prepared
in the morning, almost down
to the last sprig of parsley, so that
it will be ready to serve at the appointed
dinner hour with only a little
additional work.

P ure C ellulose C urtains
Look L ik e R a re C hintzes
Pure cellulose curtains that look
like printed linens and rare chintzes
are making home-decorating history
for 1939. So low is their cost that
an entire house can be redraped
for less than $10, and when the curtains
are soiled they can be thrown
away and replaced for a cost equal
to or less than the cost of laundering.
Looking like vellum and feeling
like fine percale, these materials are
soft, pliable, with permanent drapability
and "h a n d .” They are available
in a wide number of patterns
and designs in rich, sunfast colors.
Coming completely finished and
ready to hang, wilh m atching tiebacks,
the drapes are sold in three
lengths.
Little Niceties Make
Cheerful Guest Room
Summer guests will appreciate a
cheerful guest room—one that has
its own style furniture and not just
miscellaneous discarded pieces. Essential
as the bed itself are a chest
of drawers for odds and ends, a
smart vanity for the feminine visitor
and a bedside lam p and table.
A chaise longue and some good
books and magazines will help take
care of those in between moments.
Most important of all, for comfort's
sake, are a good mattress and •
good spring.

Her Complaint
The old lady was being visited by
the vicar. She said: “ I wish you
would offer prayers in the church
j for me, V ic ar."
"Certainly I w ill.”
“ I wish you would mention what
| is the matter with me—I hav* a
floating kidney."
“ I can’t very well do that.”
“ I don’t see why not,” protested
the old lady. “ I ’ve often heard
you praying for loose livers.” —

Free Advice
The woman who found herself
seated next to an eminent doctor at
j the dinner party thought she would
j make the most of her luck.
“ Do you know, doctor,” she said,
“ sometimes I feel so tired that I
can scarcely walk to do my mom-
I mg shopping. Is there anything you
could recommend me to take?”
"C ertainly,” the doctor replied,
genially; “ take a taxi.”
Logs for the Apartment
There are now fireplace logs suited
to the apartment dweller. They
are compressed under great pressure
out of sawdust and shavings so
that each log is bone dry, clean,
uniform in size (4 by 12'i inches),
and has no splinters. There is almost
no storage problem, as each
log burns for four hours, and a
month’s supply can easily fit into
the closet along with thc umbrella
and galoshes. These logs give off a
colored flame—blue, orange, purple
or green—very much like fires made
from driftwood.

Balance of Nature
"N a tu re ," explained the lecturer,
"always tries to make compensation.
For instance, if one eye is lost
the other becomes stronger, and if a
person is deaf in one ear the hearing
of the other is more acute.”
“ F aith ,” said P at, “ and I believe
you’re right, for I ’ve noticed that
when a m an has one leg shorter the
other is always longer.”
C O LIT TL E MISSY and Miss
^ Sweet Sixteen are dated up for
just one party after another thi»
summer? Hearts set all a flutter
as to delectable gowns that will
m ake young moderns look pretty
as a picture? Which leads up to
the why and wherefore of the accompanying
illustration. This group
of adorable party frocks conveys
an all-important style message in
regard to summertime party frocks,
namely that of the supremacy of
fine silken sheer fabrics in the
mode.
The weaves in the category of silk
sheers that are favored most include
silk organdies in white or pastels,
marquisettes, mousseline de
soies, also either soft or starched
silk chiffons, frothy white silk tulles,
silk nets and of course the loveliness
of silk laces is not ignored. Not a
sheer in the above mentioned list
but that works like magic in accenting
the endearing young charms
of party-going young daughters this
season.
The outstanding characteristic of
the new sheer frocks is a quaintness
that reminisces of Civil war
fashions. To give the ultra-feminine
look and the coy simplicity that present
styling implies, designers are
indulging freely in such fetching details
as flounces, dainty ruffles, bowknot
or flower appliques, and the
newest gesture is the revival of
gay ribbons (supposed to change
the color of your ribbons to tune to
your mood) run through yards and
yards of beading, just like in the
old-fashioned days.
The majority of party frocks look
very bouffant with their wide skirts,
and the most u ltra models have
nipped-in waistlines like heirloom
daguerrotypes portray, for the
trend at present Is more and more
to wasp waist silhouettes. The
flounce that flourished in C ivil war
times have returned.
Sometimes just one knee-deep
flounce gives added fullness about
the hemline. Then again flounces
are tiered one above another. The
old-fashioned way of heading the
flounce with lace or embroidery
beading, through which colorful
beading has been run. adds to the
quaintness of present day styling.
In the lovely girlish frock to the
left the bow-knot applique done in
ribbon enhances the full skirt. The
little girl in the background has
her Silk organdy dress sim ilarly
fashioned, thus carrying out the
popular idea of sister fashions.
Frocks of this type are equally lovely
fashioned of either white or pastel
chiffons or silk organdies.
The little girls in the foreground
are charmingly gowned. The d im in utive
lace jacket worn, as shown
centered in the picture, is enough
to delight any little g irl’s heart.
Very prettily styled is the other
little girl's dress. It is made all of
lace with flutings of self lace adorning
the bodice top and outlining the
waistline.
A styling trend very noticeable in
the smartest new gowns is that of
the all-over shirred waist. The new
sheers yield to this treatment very
pleasingly. The shirring can be easily
done by the home dressmaker,
by loosening the tension of one's
sewing machine and lengthening
the stitch. Then when the machine
stitching is done pull the top thread
and even shirring will result. Thin
paper placed under chiffon while
stitching keeps material flat. It
tears away easily.

Dining Bay Excludes Flies
If you want to eat outdoors in
warm weather, but the flies make
the meal a nuisance, how about add- |
ing a bay to your living or dining \
room? You can sit with windows on
practicaHy three sides of you, but !
by screening them, banish the annoying
and unsanitary little insects.
F irst Fish—What did they have
for dessert at the banquet?
Second Fish—Why, Jellyfish, of
course!
Sealing Jellies
Paraffin used for sealing jellies
should be "sm oking” hot, since it
sterilizes as well as seals. Tilt the
glass in order that the melted paraffin
m ay form a seal around the
side of the glass as well as a covering
for the top.
Message From Dad
Eloping Bride— Here's a telegram
from father.
Eloping Groom—What does he
say?
Eloping Bride— Don’t come homa
and all w ill be forgiven.
Flowery Speech
Miss Manchester—If you really
love a girl why not say it with flowers?
Mr. Hardfax—Now, that's a good
idea. It wouldn't be nearly as binding
as a letter.
The lumber-Jacket Influence continues
throughout summer fashions.
I So much so m an y of the daintiest
sheer lingerie blouses are now made
with belts (some worked with lace
i insertion snd edging) that fasten
I over the skirt. Printed silk sheers
j such aB pictured proclaim the new
I fad in this youthful lumber-jacket
j silhouette that has come in on the
! crest of the widely heralded "little
g irl” vogue. Note how its belt buttons
over the skirt. The remarkable
thing about the silk that fashions
i this dress is that it is the new sanitized
type, treated with process that
I acts as a deodorant.
Flare for Rubber
Flowers Growing
The idea of wearing the new rubber
flowers as a corsage or boutonniere
elsewhere than on the
beach is gaining. These lovely
flowers are too attractive to confine
within a limited realm. Then, too,
they ^ r e eminently practical, for
soap and water will keep them
fresh-looking indefinitely.
Natural colors, grace of design
and true reproduction of nature
m arks these corsages as outstanding.
Anemones in pastel colors enliven
a swim suit with true artistry.
Deep pink camelias are lovely to
wear in an evening coiffure. Hoses
of realistically colored rubber and
d ahlias in colors true on sport ja c k ets
are ever so effective and outstanding.
Flowers and Snoods
A charming evening headdress, if
you wear your hair long enough to
use a snood, is the combination of
1 snood and flowers.
**D E A R MRS. S P E A R S : 1 have
^ a pair of lamps for my
dressing table, and I would like to
use some of my curtain material
to cover plain shades. Can you
tell me how this is done? C. H .”
Here is a method that is shown
for a living room lam p in Book 1.
It may be used for a shade of
any size. You will need the top
and bottom rings from an old
lam p shade. A cardboard foundation
is cut to fit these, ond the
chintz or other fabric is pasted to
the edge of this.
The AB line in the pattern diagram
is as long as the diameter
of the bottom ring. The dotted
vertical line is approximately as
long as the depth of the shade.
The CD line is as long as the
diameter of the top ring. Draw
the diagonal lines to touch the
ends of the AB and CD lines.
Place a tack where they meet at
E. Place a pencil through a loop
in a string, as shown, and draw
the bottom line of the shade m aking
it as long as the measurement
around the bottom ring plus a
half inch. Shorten the string and
draw the top to fit the top ring
allowing for a half inch lap.

Stripes Hack in
Fashion Picture
The cycle of fashions continues to
revolve and now the indicator stops
at 1915, the era of the Castle walk
and, from the sartorial standpoint,
of stripes.
But striped materials in the hands
of the modern designer have a spicy
verve wholly different from those
recorded in the fashion books of almost
a quarter of a century ago.
One of their paramount virtues is
that they are slimming. However,
their chief charm is that they lend
themselves to such varied and exciting
adaptions.
