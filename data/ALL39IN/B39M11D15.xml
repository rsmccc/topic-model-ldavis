         <p>ARMISTICE DAY
Fittingly observed
Armistice day was observed here
under the auspices o f the Veterans of
Foreign Wars Business places of
the city were closed between the
hours of 10 and 12 that day and the
auditorium was practically filled by
the audience which gathered for this
occasion A group o f young people
from throughout the county came in
a body to attend a fine representative
group of 4 H boys and girls
here for Achievement day which declared
a recess during the time o f
the program 
Patriotic organizations met at the
Legion hall at 10 30 a m and marched
to the auditorium preceded by the
Black River Falls High school band 
Seated on the stage were members
o f the high school band and at the
front of the stage the speakers o f the
day and the officers of the city  s patriotic
organizations From left to
right there were Mrs C F Sprester 
president o f the Legion Auxiliary 
Mrs Oscar Teeples president of the
V F W A uxiliary Harry Helbling 
a d jutan t of the V F W Hilman
Olson president of the American Legian
 Rev A M Romstad Rev H 
A Allison and Father Peters the
speaker of the day Mr Helbling represented
Milton Stenulson president
o f the V F W Rev Allison gave
the invocation and Rev Romstad who
was unavoidably delayed but who arrived
in time for the benediction 
There was an excellent program A
march played by the band was followed
by    America          the audience
singing the first and second verses 
Rev Allison then pronounced a solemn
benediction at the close of which
there was the two minute silent tribute
with    Taps   played by Tommy
Hagen The band then played    God
Bless Oita Native Land   with the audience
singing one verse 
Father Peters the speaker of the
day made a powerful plea for peace
in his fine talk I f all who heard
him can keep in mind the single
minded devotion to peace which he
advocated and can spread the gospel
o f it he will have accomplished his
object He sketched a background of
past history and drew a word picture
o f future history in case we are not
dedicated to peace in this country He
warned against propaganda and urged
all to be dedicated to peace He
had the close attention of his audience 
   The Star Spangled Banner   was
sung by the audience and the program
closed with a benediction by
Rev Romstad who publicly thanked
Father Peters for his talk and commented
on how fittin g it was to the
time and the occasion 
The patriotic organizations marched
out to the music of the    32nd
Division March   played by the band 
with the audience standing 
A bold bad burglar entered the
Banner Journal office last Thursday
night As a burglar he was bolder
and badder than he was wise or he
would have known that money or
other valuables are scarce around in
or about printshops ??B ut he sure
did work hard finding that out He
pulled out files and drawers scattering
things about twisted the handle
on the safe which was as empty of
cents as his head was o f sense and
had just a riotous time delving into
places he evidently thought he might
fin d something to pay him for all the
trouble he was taking and making 
Probably he had a thrill for a moment
as he found a beaded buckskin purse
which we had receivnd as a Christmas
present from one of our Indian
friends many years ago and had
tucked away for safe keeping But
his thrill was over when he threw it
on the floor apparently disappointed
by its emptiness The only thing
which he regarded as valuable enough
to carry away was a little kodak camera 
and that he feloniously took with
him For his information if he has
not discovered the fact we would say
the camera is a bit defective and one
not knowing o f the defect and how
to avoid its consequences can get
good snapshots So there he is again 
Had the b b burglar let us know
that he wanted to search the oifice
fo r coin of the realm we should have
been pleased to join him in the search
and saved him a bit o f bother Sheriff
Waldum looked over the trail of
the bad man the following morning 
and found finger prints in plenty 
which have been sent in for identification 
so we can find the burglar  s
address and extend our sympathy 
born of experience We have been
hunting for money in the B J office
fo r months and years and know how
hard it is to find any However if
the bold bad man will return the
camera which only we can make
work we  ll pay him 5 as a reward
fo r his complimentary visit In all
the years gone before nobody has
ever flattered us by hunting for money
in our sanctum 
Anton Ellingson o f Northfield was
in town Monday on business and included
in it advertising for two yearlin
g heifers which have been lost from
his pasture and which a wide search
has failed to find A bout the only
solution it would seem in this case
is that somebody got away with the
heifers for purposes o f their own 
However it may be that they have
just strayed off somewhere and we
trust that this may be the solution 
There was a very good attendance
and a good time at the card party at
St Joseph  s church last week Mrs 
John Kutchera was high for the ladies
fo r 500 and Charles Gomer for the
men Frank Hryz and Mrs M J 
Harpold were low winners at 500 
Miss Regina Weibel and Louis Gardipee
were high winners at bridge 
No lows were given

The schools of the city will be closed
Thursday and Friday Nov 23 and
24 and again on Thursday and Friday
the following week Nov 30 and
Dec 1st The two days lost will be
made up at the end of the semesters 
A questionnaire was sent out from
the school to get an idea as to which
was preferred and the opinions received
were divided so it was decided
that both week ends would be declared
a holiday here Some had plans
for the first week and others for the
second 
Thanksgiving this year is more or
less of a problem throughout the
country and it is a question of whether
people are going to be doubly
thankful or forget to be thankful at
all

American people to stay out of the H a jn d ic a p 105 105 105 ????? European hostilities Mabel Freer Lo I
veridge Paloa Kansas pens this one 
???When I am rocking you my son 
And singing lullabies 
Someone is planning stouter planes
For Death to ride the skies 
While I am dressing you my son 
In little boyish suits 
Someone is making uniforms
And sturdier soldier boots 
   While you are chasing butterflies
Amid the tangled grass 
Someone is testing chemicals
To make a deadlier gas 
And while you eat your simple fare 
Perhaps the war lords sit
To start again the bugle notes
That only call the fit 
  While I would build a splendid man
So fine and strong my son 
Someone in secret tries to make
A farther reaching gun  
A gun that on some distant day 
When drums of battle roll 
May leave me with a golden star
And iron in my soul

How a child eats has as much to do
with his health as what he eats 
Children should learn early in life
to eat at regular times believes Mrs 
Charlotte Clark Buslaff extension nutritionist
at the Wisconsin College of
Agriculture They should have a
simple wholesome diet and take what
is set before them 
   Coaxing will not teach a child to
eat   she explains    but almost all
children with healthy appetites are
ready to eat nearly anything that is
offered them Of course some children
naturally have better appetites
than others but if your child shows
the signs of good health gains weight
steadily and eats a well planned diet
you need not worry because he does
not want so much food as some other
children He may not need so much   
Eating habits are not inherited but
little children do imitate older people 
The child who has been fed correctly
as a baby is not usually a special
feeding problem unless he learns to
copy people who are fussy about their
food 
Whenever a food is given to a child
for the first time it  s well to give it
at the beginning of a meal when the
youngster is especially hungry I f he
refuses it again and again it is often
wise to stop serving t for a week or
so and then start it again   without
any comment One way to teach children
to eat foods is to let them get
really hungry 
Meals should be served at regular
intervals and no nibbles or sweets
allowed between times However 
Mrs Buslaff says this doesn  t mean
that children can have only three
meals a day   many need mid morning
or mid afternoon lunches or both The
point is that these should be regular
and should not keep a child from
having an appetite at meal times 
Milk and bread or fruit are good for
between meals lunches 
It is well to make young children
realize early that certain foods such
as tea coffee and rich cake are
grown up  s foods If he asks for
them it is usually easy to answer 
  No that is for the grown ups you
may have some when you are older   
Don  t give the child a bite because
he begs or teases for it

Accidents can happen anywhere  
unexpectedly and in the most unusual
circumstances Here are some accidents
reported to the State Highway
commission last week 
A car struck a wolf The wolf  s
body disconnected the battery cable 
Another car smashed into the unlighted
car 
High school students were pulling
a buggy home from a football parade 
They were struck by an automobile 
A truck hit a cow smashing the
front of the truck The cow was
tossed into the air and in coming
down smashed the back end of the
truck The cow was killed 
Into a priest  s car flew a hornet 
He opened the window and watched
the hornet fly to freedom His car
left the highway and turned over 
The State Highway commission
classified the wolf and the cow as
  livestock   the boys with the buggy
as    pedestrians   and the hornet accident
as a    non collision

Mrs Margaret Instenes was happily
surprised by 50 relatives and friends
Thursday afternoon at the home of
her son and daughter in law Mr and
Mrs Andrew Instenes A four o  clock
lunch was served and everybody
had a fine time Her friends will
like the following story about the
occasion which appeared before hand
in the La Crosse Tribune 
Melrose Pioneer is Slightly
Bewildered by Modern Age
Mrs Margrette Instenes of Melrose
will celebrate her 95th birthday on
Thursday acting hostess to numerous
relatives and friends One would
take her to be much less than her
95 years for she has no appearance
of frailty and her rosy cheeks and
bright eyes over which she needs no
glasses would make one think her to
be at least 20 years younger 
Today on her birthday she will welcome
her guests at the door she will
talk with them in her native Norwegian 
intelligently and with a mind
that has not grown dim I f it were
any day other than her natal one she
would herself serve her guests afternoon
coffee and jump up from time
to time to fill an empty cup From
her never exhausted supply of gift
candy she will offer some to each
guest and carefully put away the rest
for another time I f they like she
will show them her loom a huge affair
in an upstairs room of her farm
home and how she throws the shuttle
from side to side Most of her time
is spent in weaving and quilting and
the money received from friends who
like to buy her things is oftentimes
shyly slipped into the hand of a small
grandchild or great grandchild 
She was bom Margrette Erickson
in Kinsarvik Norway Nov 3 1844 
and married Howard Instenes about
20 years later Of their seven children
five are still living Mrs A V 
Logan of San Benito Tex Emil Instenes
of Ontario Calif Andrew Instenes 
of Melrose Mrs David Davenport 
of Beloit and Lars Instenes
of La Crosse clerk of La Crosse county
circuit court Mrs Inga Klarman
and Mrs Anna Instenes are deceased 
In 1883 the family excepting Emil 
Mrs Davenport and Mrs Isaacson 
who were bom here came to the
United States Their journey was
made in a combination sail and steam
boat which took 30 days to cross the
Atlantic They farmed first in Beaver
Creek Trempealeau county and
later near Melrose where a home was
purchased Mr Instenes died in June 
1916 and Mrs Instenes continued
living on the same farm with her son
Andrew and his family with whom
she is today She is    Grandma   to
13 grandchildren and great grandmother
to six 
This modern age slightly bewilders
Mrs Instenes her life for many years
has centered in her home and church
just a short distance away Her longest
trips in recent years have been to
La Crosse once about ten years ago
and again this spring when she came
to see her son Lars who was seriously
ill On the first of these trips 
Mrs Jorand Grindy her niece and
fellow passenger on the boat from
Norway and now neighbor in Shake
Hollow accompanied her and they
had their one and only adventure
with a street car ride and seeing a
motion picture 
Recently electric lights have been
installed in her home and at first they
to her were a miracle to be marveled
at but to be just a wee bit afraid
of She enjoys having her picture
taken but the years have taken none
of her vanity for she shows none of
those on which she thinks she looks
too old 
First recollections of grown grandchildren
find her no different in appearance
or activity she may yet
shake the apple trees for their children
as she did for them and by the
former be called as affectionately 
  Little Grandma

A most unusual and interesting social
was held at the Mill Creek school
last Friday night Oct 27th Miss Leone
Hardie the teacher planned and
very ably supervised the party and
for a month all of Mill Creek buzzed
with excitement and anticipation over
the coming event 
It was called   The Old Fashioned
Party   When Friday night came 
people dressed in beautiful old fashioned
finery which they had collected
during the last month 
There was a fine old fashioned program 
Miss Hardie  s pupils danced
square dances dressed in old fashioned
costumes They sang and gave a
play A men  s trio from the district 
sang A speaker from La Crosse
gave a very fine talk 
Then the highlight of the evening
took place the dress parade Miss
Hardie gave prizes to the best dressed
family and the best dressed man 
and the best dressed woman Miss Edwards
and Miss Wanek of the Melrose
High school faculty acted as
judges The Elmer Erickson familywon
the family prize Mrs Stetzer
was the best dressed woman and Otto
Busse the best dressed man They
wore costumes from 50 years ago 35
years 25 years and on down to five
or ten years ago It was remarkable
to see the trouble every one had gone
to to join in the spirit of the party 
One could tell the fine spirit of cooperation
between pupils teacher and
the people of the district that was
necessary to make this party such a
huge success 
A blanket was sold and a sale held 
They sold articles brought from home
by the pupils such as cabbages rutabagas 
beans popcorn doughnuts lefse 
dishes and even bouquets of bittersweet 
The evening wound up by
selling lunches and coffee All went
home with a feeling of respect for
  those good old days

Hi Ho! Josie! The lone ranger
writes again 
Well here we are folks at the
time of year when no more can we
sing of the glories of glorious autumn
when all the beautiful pastorial
colors of the northern lights are mysteriously
sprayed on the leaves of the
forests The leaves have turned from
their gaiety to a rusty brown as tho
in despair They do say that winter
is just around the corner but as Columbus
said I can  t see how winter
can be around the corner when the
earth is round 
Will wonders never cease! It has
been legislatively decided that we are
having so much to be thankful for we
have been given the opportunity to
celebrate Thanksgiving day twice 
Just seven days apart That gives us
more time to talk turkey I said we
have so much to be thankful for and
that  s true considering that the Russian
bear and the German eagle are
runnink amuck amongst small defenseless
nations 
It was the month before Christmas 
Not a thing was still in the
house or in the Senate either Momentous
moments were a stirring
within the breast of the Christian eagle 
excusing moral support of the
Allies with the capitalist group  s axiom
   business is business   
During the dark days of the Depression
when the President came out
with the NRA bearing the spread
eagle screaming   We do our part  
cextain groups of the press blazoned
their headlines with many unpleasant
names for the chief executive when
really he saved untold millions from
the slough of Despond Later when
the Republican capitalist withdrew
their financial resources from circulation
and business went into a slump
the press called it the Roosevelt Depression 
Now when the President
has placed big business on a sound
footing by the embargo repeal certain
groups say that he has not only
taken one step toward leading this nation
to war but he has taken two
steps Mighty hard proposition to
please every one 
An uncensored communique from
the headquarters of The Cookie Jar
states that grandmothers are wonderful
beings and are in the very
sense of the word Godmothers adding
a little to the quotation just to
make it a little stronger I am certain
that characteristic of grandmothers
is universal mine being real fullblooded
redskin grandmother That
interesting paragraph in the Cookie
Jar most certainly brought back to
me worlds and oceans of pleasant memories
of the times when the world
was young and I was nine years old 
In those days    boys were boys   and
sometimes bad boys and I was the
latter 1 remember once while visiting
with my grandparents having
nothing else to do I made a spear by
driving a spike into a straight pole
and then filing it sharp Against the
wall of the log cabin stood the family
wash tub The center of the corrugated
bottom made a nictf enticing
target 1 made foui nice neat holes
in it 1 went on and made more neat
holes in the chicken drinking pan
which was at the time bottom side
up Some little time later grandma
asked me if I had done the neat penetrations 
I said    yes   Unlike
George I could have told a lie but I
thought for the time being honesty
was the best policy She looked at
me with eyes askance and never said
one word but I could see her mind
was full of meaningful thoughtful
thoughts As I look back to that day
I am sure if she had spoken her piece
the very atmosphere in the immediate
vicinity would have to had been air
conditioned Not so long afterwards
while wandering around the little
farm in the early hours of the morning
when the fog and mist was heavy
I came across a new bom colt born
of my grandmother  s sorrel mare As
fast as I could I brought back the
ticings of great joy to my grandparents 
Grandmother said    Grandson 
bring that you were the first one to
see the colt that colt is yours   Such
are grandmothers the world over 
Author of Cookie Jar   I hope sincerely

The Mormons Swear Vengeance
on the Gentiles
Spaulding Applies for U S Forces
at F ort C raw ford for assistance
in case of an attack from the
Mormons
A T ransfer of    F alls   Property
P au l K night
D eath of Joe Smith
Spaulding Makes a Purchafe of the
Mormons
   Uncle Jo h n    Levis
CHAPTER FOUR
As soon as the chief Mormon at
Nichols   heard of the facts connected
with the retreat of the Saints from
Spaulding  s Claim he vowed that the
Gentiles should leave the river and at
once sent a messenger post haste to
Nauvoo for sixty men and one hundred
muskets 
Spaulding hearing of the proceeding 
and anticipating that he and his
men with what others might join
them would be hardly strong enough
to prevent the Mormon threat from
being carried into execution with the
additional strength and expected reinforcement
would give them hastened
down to Fort Crawford at Prairie
du Chien laid the case before the
officer in command and concluded by
asking him if he would render assistance
in the event of trouble with the
Mormons 
The Commander instantly replied 
that should they attempt hostilities 
he would with his command sweep
them from the river without fail 
Jonathan Nichols was at the Prairie
at the time in company with Spaulding 
and heard the officer make the
promise of assistance and on his return
home informed the Saints that 
if they were at all particular about a
lengthy stay on earth they had better
let the Gentiles alone at the same
time informing them of what he had
heard the commander of the United
States troops promise Spaulding at
Fort Crawford 
This cooled off the martial ardor ot
the Mormons to such an extent that
when their reinformcements arrived 
which was a short time after the
guns were carefully laid aside while
the new men were set at work lumbering
instead of slaughtering Gentiles 
and from that time on during
their stay on the river the Mormons
   Roared you as gently as any sucking
dove   made no more threats of
using force to accomplish their ends 
but were in all respects peaceable and
well disposed citizens 
In the spring of 1843 Spaulding
sold out to them the Falls property
for about 20 000 payable mostly in
lumber It consisted at that time of
the little mill first built on Town
Creek the large mill before described 
which was complete except the
running gear on one side the cabin
first built a small frame boarding
house located about where A Wehinger  s
store now stands and one other
log cabin that Hiram Yeatman occupied
when he returned to the Falls 
which stood on the corner of what is
now the northside comer of Main and
Water streets a blacksmith shop 
standing on or near the present 6ite
of Hope  s jewelry shop with the claim
before mentioned 
Spaulding received some money besides
the one half interest of the Mormons
in the Nichols mill in payment 
while the balance of the purchase
money was to be paid in lumber as
above stated 
The new occupants of the Falls property
were in their way very devout
in all the outward observances of
their peculiar religion had preaching
regularly as the Sabbath came at
which every Saint was present as a
matter of course that lived anywhere
near it and among their congregations
were frequently to be seen outsiders 
whose curiosity prompted their
presence at the Mormon tabernacle 
Old Paul Knight the millwright 
who subsequently became well known
to everybody living on Black River 
had that summer in his wanderings
up and down the earth struck the
river and the prospect of business in
his line seeming good he stayed one
pleasant Sabbath morning while pretty
strongly under spirituous influences 
he found his way into the Mormon
sanctuary where Elder Lyman
White was vigorously dispensing the
word to the Faithful and unraveling
Mormon mysteries in a manner that
soon gained the undivided attention
of our friend Paul who in his then
somewhat mellow condition was very
impressible and open to conviction 
The Elder In the course of his remarks 
made use of the following language 
  That he would rather go to
Hell willingly than be forced into
Heaven   The originality of the remark
struck Paul at once so forcibly
that he burst out    You would would
you    The moment the Elder recovered
from his astonishment at the unseemly
interruption he replied that
  He most certainly should       Bully
for you by G  d   shouted Paul who 
rising with an effort and making one
step forward fell sprawling amid the
assembled multitude completely overcome
with his emotions a frightful
example of the effect of new and
strange theological ideas suddenly developed
in men of Paul  s sensitive nature
and impulsive temperament 
Such incidents may sound roughand
even vulgar to the fore refined
taste of these latter days but as a
veracious historian of times when
rough men were common I cannot
well omit detailing one now and then 
besides the recital of the above will
at once bring out Old Paul in review
before the mind  s eye of his old acquaintances
on the river and there
are many such who will remember
him with all his eccentricities virtues
and failings and I will so leave the
question of propriety to future commentators
upon this history (if any
there should be) to criticize or modify 
praise or blame the course adopted
herein as may seem to them best 
On the 7th day of June 1844 Joseph
Smith the founder and expounder
of Mormonism was killed by
a mob at Carthage Illinois Spaulding
at the time was at Warsaw 18 miles
from there and within a day or two
after started up home and was the
first to inform the Mormons at the
Falls of the death of their great
prophet 
They were thunderstruck at the
news were loud in the expression of
utter disbelief of the fact of his death
claiming that he could not be killed
by any bullet run by mortal hands 
but conviction of the truth of the report
eventually fastened upon their
minds and they at once dropped all
business the mills were stopped laborers
called in and preparations at
once made for leaving the river determined
to return to Nauvoo and aid
their brethren there in avenging the
death of their leader 
Spaulding soon made arrangement 
with them for taking back tne Falls
property They ratted up ail the loose
lumber tore down and raited the
boards from several shanties they had
erected during their occupancy and
in a few days had bidden good bye to
Black River as an organized community 
Arriving at La Crosse prairie
they sold for a mere pittance their
lumber to Miller M e r rick who were
then just ready to commence their
Indian trading operations at that
point and that lumber was used in
constructing the first buildings on the
site of the present flourishing city of
La Crosse 
During the year John Levis (who
had come on the river the year before
) commenced preparations for
erecting a saw mill on or very near
the site of his present one near the
mouth of Iron Creek as the maps
have it but known to the people in
this country generally by the name of
Levis creek and emptying into Black
river about two miles above the I1 alls 
Levis had lived and lumbered at
that point ever since For years his
place was a favorite resort of young
people on festive occasions and a
??????splendid time   was always had at
  Uncle John  s   as he was and is yet 
one of the kindest hearted men that
lives and enjoyed a frolic with his
whole heart withal Uncle John
never was very rapid in his movements 
his style of getting around being
rather slow and deliberate than
otherwise 
In early times Spaulding got a joke
on him which caused considerable
amusement 
Spaulding loaned Uncle John a
shovel which in a few days Levis returned
broken and undertook to explain
the mishap by saying   That getting
in a hurry         What!   says
Spaulding    You got in a hurry   
  Yes   says Levis   and        Never
mind   says Spaulding   not a cent
will I take I f you got in a hurry 
it  s fortunate nothing more serious
than a broken shovel occurred

   Do you snore  I f so you undoubtedly
need medical attention   
states the State Medical Society in its
weekly health bulletin 
   Snoring is insidious in many ways 
It disturbs the sleep of those exposed
to it and lessens the rest of the offender 
Only one out of ten snorers
knows he has the habit although often
he is awakened by the thunder of
his own rumblings 
   Briefly snoring is breathing with
a peculiar rough noise in the sleep 
which is due to vibrations of the soit
palate and uvula It is a hoarse lar
bored respiration produced by deep
inspiration and expiration through the
nose and open mouth The normal
sleeper on the other hand keeps his
mouth closed breathes naturally
through the nostrils and prevents vibration
of the loose tissues of the
throat 
   It is true that there are more men
snorers than women but the women
are just as noisy and thorough in
their performance Inside workers
and those who do not exercise are
more inclined to snore than outdoor
workers Business men who are confirmed
snorers often stop when on
hunting or fishing trips which keep
them outdoors during the day 
   There are many causes of snoring 
The sleeper may have his nose
buried in the pillow so that he has to
breathe through his mouth Or he
may be lying on his back and the
jaw muscles may let the mouth drop
open Generally snoring indicates
disturbances in the breathing apparatus 
especially obstruction in the nose
that prevents him from sleeping with
mouth closed The obstruction may
be a result of a projecting mass of
swollen mucous membrane tumor
growths bony deformities sinus infection
or a deviated wall between
the two nasal cavities encroaches on
the air space of one nostril Chronic
inflammation of the nasal linings also
may cause an enlargement of the tissues
sufficient to obstruct the nose 
   Strange but true certain foods
may cause a person to snore Many
men and women are sensitive to certain
proteins If they eat tomatoes 
for instance the mucous membranes
of the nose have a tendency to accumulate
secretions Some authorities
believe that snoring has increased in
recent years because cigaret smoking
has been accepted generally and because
more persons are working indoors 
Without doubt it does increase
in the winter as the result of
colds and overheated sleeping rooms 
  What can be done about snoring 
If there is a snorer in the family 
he should be examined by his family
doctor In children snoring commonly
is an indication of enlarged
adenoids In most cases it results
from a physical defect which can be
corrected making for better rest for
the snorer and a happier home for the
rest of the household

American Legion meets 2nd and

C O O P E R A T V E N E W S
(By Earl Horswill)
Washington D C    The nation  s
No 1 housewife Mrs Franklin D 
Roosevelt has advised her fellow
housewives on steps they may take to
prevent war profiteering Among the
steps she suggested is an educational
program in the newspapers and over
the radio by consumer co operatives
or similar organizations to avert price
boosts arising from   housewives panic    
large volume buying induced by
unfounded fears of food shortage In
an article in the Democratic Digest 
organ of the Womens Division of the
Democratic National committee Mrs 
Roosevelt declared that profiteering
can be curbed by concerted action of
American housewives In addition to
suggesting coiisumer cooperatives the
First Lady urgeu women to check retail
prices against wholesale prices as
listed in daily newspapers and to boycott
articles whose prices jump unreasonably 
The spotlight of the world was
turned on Finland for a few days last
week when territorial claims were
made upon her Finland has been an
interesting nation for some time as
she is the only nation that is paying 
her war debt to us She has repeatedly
asserted that her ability to pay
off the debt is due to savings effected
by her co operatives Forty percent
of the retail trade is done cooperatively
and they are run very efficiently 
During the three most severe
years of the depression 1931 
34 there were 2 482 business failures 
not one of which was a co operative 
Henry A Morgenthau Secretary
of Treasury of the U S when
visiting the Scandinavian countries at
the outbreak of the present war was
entertained by Vaino Tanner Finland  s
Minister of Finance who is
also president of the International
Co operative Alliance and general
manager of the Elanto Co operative
Society which provides its 50 000
members in this small northern city
with 8 000 000 worth of goods a
year With Mr Tanner Sec Morgfenthau
visited a set of Elanto  s Coop 
stores including a bakery dairy
shop grocery butcher shop and drug
store and had lunch in a co operative
restaurant   Mr Morgenthau was
very much interested in the great
importance of the consumer  s co operative
movement in Finland   Mr 
Tanner reported 
Risto Ryti president of the Bank
of Finland said during a visit to the
United States three years ago that
  The low cost of distribution is an
important factor in our national recovery 
and for this our Consumers
Co operative Movement is responsible 
Owing to this movement the middleman
preys less upon the economic
substance of the country than almost
anywhere else in the world   During
the latter part of the last century
large numbers of Fins migrated to
this country and is settled in the Lake
Superior region During the World
War when high prices were prevalent
and large profits were being taken
they sought to free themselves from
this social and economic evil by establishing
co operative stores Knowing
how co operatives were run in
their homeland they had a wonderful
knowledge to build upon To supply
these stores they set up the Central
Co operative Wholesale which now
serves 140 co operative stores located
in northern Wisconsin northeastern
Minnesota and Western Michigan 
Their northern most store is at
Roy Minn 151 miles north of Superior 
To give some idea of the
amount of business transacted by the
Central Co operative Wholesale the
total sales for September mounted to
 430 000 which is 40 above the volume
for September of 1938

through and were very interesting 
Others were just black one in particular
showed our former men D M 
McCormack and his son Carroll and
wife Joe Archer and wife and Ed
Dunn and wife They all looked and
acted as though they were ready to
speak and no doubt they would like

stating his ideas on how it will be
run 
More prizes and that goes without
saying they  re better too and more
keen competition will be shown in this
carnival of   39 These will be given
out in games door prizes and
carnival queen prizes 
Mr Osborne and Miss Hanson will
be the chairmen and are already
pushing everything before them with
ful force The next two weeks is
packed so full that we are all beginning
to look and feel like sardines but
as long as its for the carnival anything
goes Every one is working 
too as the girls will also receive a
cut in on the proceeds A percentage
has been figured out so the different
organizations around school
will all be in on the net profits 
So far the stands that have been
chosen will be as follows 
G A A 1   Candy stand
Dramatics club   A play    Orville  s

the fact that they were select is testified
by the fact that Dr Van
Schaick wrote back thanking the donor
and stating that they were the
best they had ever seen in those parts 
Dr Van Schaick also sent the recipe
showing what they did with the berries 
and T J D has had so many
requests for the recipe that he decided
the simple way to pass it along
would be through the B J We are
pleased to pass it along and even to
make allowance for the Florida prejudice
shown in the notes

The question of what is going to
happen to our Merchant Marine policy
is bothering the President and Secretary
of State Apparently there was
a loop hole left in the new Neutrality
law in spite of the weeks spent in debating
and perfecting it through
which some of our big ocean ship
companies are trying to escape the
provisions of the new law transfer
their official registry to the government
of Panama and thus participate
in the very profitable traffic in commodities
between our own and the
belligerent countries One purpose of
the new law is to prevent our ships
entering the war zone abroad and
through a war disaster provoking our
national sentiment to a dangerous
point The history of the City of
f lin t case in the past month which
has aroused and maintained intense
public interest is an indication of
what might happen if further difficulties
were encountered 
The Secretary of State insists that
the attempted transfer of registry of
the vessels of one of our largest companies
and one which has been most
liberally subsidized from our federal
treasury is contrary to the spirit
if not the letter of the new law The
president has questioned that viewpoint 
and at first glance was inclined
to think it was erroneous He is going
more deeply into the matter and in
a few days probably he will determine
whether to permit the Maritime Commission
to allow the transfer of the
nine vessels to Panama registry as has
been requested Though he may differ
with the Secretary of State as to
the construction of the law he is in
full sympathy with him as to the purpose
of the provision which would
help keep our nation out of war by
prohibiting our ships to engage in a
dangerous traffic 
I f this transfer of registry is permitted
by the one big corporation 
others soon will follow and the merchant
marine which has been built up
by billions in grants loans and subsidies
soon will be flying foreign flags 
leaving us where we were before the
money commenced to flow so liberally
to the coffers of the shipping lines 
Furthermore there will arise another
great labor problem After the transfers
the ocean boats would discharge
their seamen and leave 10 000 or
more of them idle and looking directly
to the government for subsistance
and relief Under the foreign registry 
the transferred ship could and
would enter the ocean trade with
warring countries at their own risk
as to consequences and employing
only alien seamen The scheme for
profits is clever but had those who
framed the new Neutrality act been
aware of such intentions or possibilities
there is no question that the law
would have been made sufficiently
strict to have prevented it It is likely
that the administration through its
control of the Maritime Commission 
may block the proposal in any event 
This is not the first   headache  
which our bountifully subsidized
ocean line corporations have given to
the government in the past twenty
years or more Every administration
has had its troubles with them Once
upon a time the Senate investigated
the Shipping Board and found where
hundreds of millions had lined the
pockets of the shipping profiteers A
few New York profiteers were indicted 
and a still fewer number went to
prison After every scandal congress
would attempt to thwart further rackets 
but somehow the ocean traffic
magnates have always found a way to
make fortunes for themselves at the
same time they were talking with such
patriotic fervor about the importance
of our ocean commerce 
In addition to the loans and grants
for vessel construction amounting to
more than half the costs of the vessels 
the U S lines which have filed
the first application for permission to
transfer to a Panama registry have
been receiving 2 000 000 a year in
operation subsidies from the federal
treasury The profits in carrying the
commerce with the nations now at
war are so great that the corporation
is willing to surrender that annual
subsidy to obtain the transfer 
I f the warring nations are figuring
the costs of the conflict it would be
interesting to learn where they can
expect to obtain the funds for a long
war Last year with only the war in
China in progress the leading nations
of the world spent over eighteen billions
of dollars on armament and ammunition 
Our country spent about
10 per cent of the total This year  s
cost is starting off at a rate of thirty
billions for the three warring countries 
and other nations are expending
about 12 billions for war preparations 
The cost of the devastation of
Poland chargeable to the invasion 
would add several billions to these
figures and evjen more will be added
by the destruction of property in other
countries as the war proceeds It
is safe to say that in a 5 year war
an amount equal to the entire wealth
of the civilized world will be required 
The    profits   of wars are always
losses of such enormous amounts that
they cannot be conceived 
Quite to the contrary interest
should be the estimates of government
experts that the people of this
country added about nine billions of
dollars to their savings accounts an
amount about equal to the expenditures
of the national government 
This sum represents mainly deposits
in banks which now have more than
five billions of excess reserve cash on
hand Building and loan associations
probably received the next largest
portion of the savings Not included
are the savings invested with life insurance
companies There now are
2 700 000 people who have postal saving  s
accounts which amount to 1 
262 000 000 More than a million
people have purchased government
   baby   bonds in the amount of nearly
two billions of dollars With improved
business conditions and the
robability of industrial development
ecause of war orders the savings of
1940 will reach a still larger figure 
The government is moving more of

Yeast Feeds
Is yeast needed in livestock rations 
Is there any profit gained
from feeding yeast to livestock 
The answers to these questions 
which livestock owners so often ask 
are given by Gus Bohstedt of the
Wisconsin College of Agriculture 
Basing his statements on results of
experiments conducted at Wisconsin
and other Mid west state experiment
stations he replies that yeast at usual
prices has not proved economical for
farm livestock in these tests 
   In spite of claims that yeast when
fed in practical rations would improve
the thrift of pigs no such effect was
observed   Bohstedt states in a report
upon trials at the Wisconsin experiment
station    It is not surprising
that yeast feeding was not beneficial   
he says   for the only vitamins
that yeast has are vitamins B and G
which are contained in liberal amount
in ordinary rations that are fed to
livestock It is therefore entirely
unnecessary and extravagant for
farmers to buy yeast to provide hia
vitamin for their stock   
Even mineralized yeast feed has
been found unprofitable As in the
case of pigs so dairy cows have not
benefitted appreciably where yeast
has been added to practical rations
such as dairymen are quite generally
able to feed In other tests yeast fed
calves made no better growth than
those fed no yeast 
Although yeast is used a great deal
in nutrition experiments for supplying
vitamins B and G for small laboratory
animals Bohstedt explains
that it does not follow that yeast has
a similar desirable effect when added
to ordinary practical rations of farm
livestock

O U R PET A M E R IC A N T R A D IT IO N
There are two remarks so frequently
heard nowadays    Why do the German
people tolerate conditions that
exist in Germany   and   The people
of the United States will never stand
for      such and such The German
people were imperceptibly and unwittingly
enmeshed during a general
apathy following the World War 
And where are registered protests to
conditions being foisted upon the
American people  In the minority 
We have been giving in an era of
inconsistency and degeneracy borrowing
ourselves out of debt curtailing
agriculture and allowing agricultural
commodities to pour into our
land from all parts of the world We
get conservation benefits occasionally 
so much dole shots in the arm to
keep us in good humor and insensible
to what it is all about We have seen
a demoralization in all about us in
finance industry youth old age personal
pride and character in institutions
and phases of life that contribute
to the stamina of a healthy society
and a democratic nation 
Now another inanity has been
thrust upon us the desecration of the
time honored and most truly American
tradition we own   Thanksgiving
on the last Thursday of November 
Without point or object Thanksgiving
has been shifted a week earlier
on the calendar This wholesome tradition 
respected and revered by generations
of stable minded and red
blooded Americans has been thrown
to the winds with an empty laugh 
spreading confusion and inconvenience
all over the land It was intimated
in defense of the act that it
will aid business by creating an extra
week for shopping before Christmas 
Commercializing on holy days and
holy seasons is a sin already too flagrant
and far flung 
It has been said that fools rush in
where angels fear to tread I feel
sure that the rawest recruit among
the angels would be shame faced to
shatter this lovely tradition instituted
and observed by the pilgrim fathers
and mothers and by generations since 
It seems that no matter what audacity
is launched there are always
henchmen who cannot seem to formulate
convictions of their own or if
they do their convictions come stillborn 
Let us hope that the grimy
fingers of autocracy forbear to reach
out and sully our bright and shiny
pet tradition   Thanksgiving on the
last Thursday of November

(Original poems were called for
over the radio in Oakland Calif and
this one was sent in by Mrs R P 
Rainey of this city and read)
Read Proverbs three   for your lesson 
See if you find any good there in 
My brother read then heed the warning 
It will lessen your burden of sin 
Life is so full of pittfalls  
Ever before our eyes 
They are wicked and evil temptations
Shunned by the learned and wise 
The years of this wise old prophet  
Were filled with trouble and strife 
And many have learned their lesson
By giving their very life 
Solomon warns against snares and
pitfalls 
He tells them to every one
Then tells you what is right to do 
And what to leave undone 
But here is another lesson
Taught by a greater one 
A lesson of love truth and charity
By God  s anointed son 
You read about him in St Matthew
And the mission for you to do
He says is to love your neighbor
As I have even loved you 
Learn these lessons my brother 
Learn them every one 
And your heavenly Father will bless
you
And say unto you   Well done

the pains were so bad I could
not get any sleep at all I felt just like
I would scream as I was in such
agony I heard of RUX and what wonderful
relief it has brought to others 
so decided to try it Soon I began to
feel better those pains were easing
up and I have been able to get my
regular sleep My friends who were
accustomed to seeing me in my suffering
are more than surprised to see
me now I am truly thankful for the
way RUX brought me relief and I
have been gladly recommending it to
other sufferers    (Mr Barlow is 80
years of age and has been a resident

(By Cornelius A Harper M D 
State Health Officer)
Last year deaths from appendicitis
in Wisconsin were limited to 325 
the lowest on record since 1919 and
some 27 less than for 1937 the second
lowest year In addition 1938
was the fifth consecutive year in
which appendicitis was less than the
preceding year while the high toll
was in 1930 when it reached 534
deaths 
Even though the trend is downward 
the figure can still be pared
down A large number of deaths
from appendicitis can be prevented
through proper medical attention 
And one of the rules recommended
by the State Medical Society the
Wisconsin Pharmaceutical Association
and the State Board of Health
who collaborated in publishing a twopoint
program against appendicitis is
this 
When abdominal pain cramps or
soreness last for several hours see
your family physician without delay

The other rule is 
Avoid laxatives or physics in the
presence of abdominal pain 
Deaths from appendicitis occur at
all ages in the life span so it is especially
important that every one observe
these two simple rules
