after several weeks illness the last
three o f which were spent in bed 
The funeral will be held in the church
Thursday afternoon 
Last week these items contained
the fact that Oscar Olson Marshall
Hugdahl and A1 Hoffman went to Chicago
to witness a ball game Well 
there is a little more to the item than
that The first two saw the game
but A1 didn t It came about in this
manner As they all had a lot o f
time before the game the first two
went about a bit but A1 wanted to
see some relatives So after the first
two thought it about time to get into
the grounds they did so and even
then had plenty o f time to look about
a bit before the game started However 
A1 couldn t find the relatives
so went around the city with a milk
delivery man he became acquainted
with About game time he went to
the grounds and lined up with a group
who were headed for the box gate 
they already having tickets A1 came
to the gate but not having a ticket
could not get in and the box tickets
were all sold out He dropped out
and evidently never thought o f going
over to one o f the other gates where
he might have gotten in So he walked
around some mire and found his
milk man again and then took in
some more o f the city until it became
time to go to the depot where he told
his troubles to the other two men who
went down with him Next time A1
goes to a ball game in Chicago he will
probably go right to the grounds and
take a bottle o f milk with him 
An Illinois car sideswiped a car
from Minnesota early last Sunday at
the junction of Nos 95 and 12 in
the village The right rear side of
the Minnesota car was damaged quite
a bit and the Illinois car ran into one
o f the large elm trees in front o f the
Stam residence occupied by the Olson
and Christianson families and the
crash practically raised them out o f
bed The head end o f this car was
very badly damaged No one was seriously
hurt the Minnesota car having
been almost stopped when the
people in it saw the Illinois car coming 
One man in the Illinois car had
a hole cut in his forehead when he
hit the windshield Officers Sherman
and Finch were called and straightened
out the affair and we understand
the Illinois folks were on the
carpet for reckless driving 
A Green Bay train consisting of
one coach and several freight cars 
crashed into a Northwestern work
train at Marshland Junction last Saturday
about 8 o clock in the morning 
Four Northwestern men were taken to
the hospital at Winona An investigation
revealed that the signals were
against the Green Bay train in charge
of Engineer John Ray who said when
he saw block against him could not
stop the train in time to avoid the accident 
Other members o f the Green
Bay crew were Gust Beter conductor 
Henry Burmeister fireman Henry
Kroll and Ben Schultz brakemen 
Mr and Mrs Jonas Johnson and
Mr and Mrs Frank Larson were in
St Paul last Saturday where they attended
the annual Veterans meeting
o f Omaha employees This time it
was held on one of the boats now plying
on the Mississippi and the excursion
took them down as far as Hastings
and back It was a very enjoyable
trip There were over 600 on
the boat and the time was passed by
a very short business meeting games 
dancing visiting and plenty to eat

Again as last year it is with great
pleasure that I thank the members o f
the Lions Club o f this city the sponsors
for Indian participation in the
recent centennial pageant for making
it possible for the Indians to take
part with profit in a local never-tobe-
forgotten event In behalf o f my
people again I say thank you 
Lions 
The little Indian boy sat up quickly
and almost yelled Oh now I
know how to eat peas Before I was
chewing them now I just let them
roll down inside o f me 
I met the correspondent o f Trout
Run at the centennial gathering and
had a nice chat with her This incident
brought back to my mind the
need o f a B J C A (Banner-Journal
Correspondent s Association) 
where we would know who is writing
which and would be the means
o f further creating interest in a home
town paper which has already become
a bright spot in our lives 
Within the last eight months many
o f our young people here in Komensky
have married and have started
on their own Fifty years from now
they can tell their grandchildren that
they were married the year o f the
centennial 
Probably good many people never
realized there was a Fourth o f July 
There was a total eclipse o f the 4th 
caused by the shadow o f the centennial
and homecoming 
Many people have said that they
do not quite understand the meaning
o f Heap Tepee Talk In short it
means Popular subjects being discussed
frequently by Indians within
Tepees Clear Thank you!
At the meeting o f the school board
o f Dist No 5 Town o f Komensky 
Monday Gilbert Lowe a full blooded
Winnebago was elected a school clerk
for the next fiscal year Gilbert is
well educated and very well qualified
for the position The Indians are beginning
to realize that in order to
learn to swim you ve got to get right
in the water and swim and this applies
to their political and educational
welfare

The Richland Center ball team was
tougher than a bride s steak in a
night game on their ball diamond last
Wednesday evening and succumbed
only after Ernie had whiffed Lotzer
for the third out in the ninth Going
into the sixth the well known Falls
boys were on the short end o f a 2
to 1 situation going into the eighth
the boys wearing M s on their shirts
were on even terms with the downstate
warriors and it looked like a
tossup The prospect looked much
better after the eighth when heroical
hits by Ellison and Hoard along with
a fumble had given Black River a
4 to 2 margin The issue became a
little clouded in the last half o f the
ninth however when a run had scored
and three o f the first four Richland
Center men had hit safely Here
was where the old pressure was needed 
and with the tying and winning
runs lurking on the baselines the diminutive
Black River fireballer fairly
scorched the last few pitches in to
embalm Shelby and Lotzer It was
Ernie s 9th triumph o f the year 
Randle got the first run o f the
game on A Rudolph s hit to left after
he had been sacrificed to second
by Kleven following his hit past third
base 
Richland came back with the tying
run in their half o f the opening canto 
A pass to Durnford followed by
a bunt by Beatty and a screeching
double by D Pauls brought it up to
even Hanson walloped a triple to
right to open chapter two A sacrifice
fly to Randles enabled Hanson
to go home 
That was all the business for Richland
until the ninth when in the last
half thereof D Pauls and Truesdale
opened with singles Berry whiffed 
then Hanson singled to score D Pauls
with the third enemy run E Rudolph
thereupon decided that the foolishment
had gone far enough and threw
out Shelby and blazed three strikes
to Lotzer 
The Merchant tally which tied the
game un in the sixth was put on base
on Art Rudolph s hit Ellison strolled 
Ernie sacrificed them to second and
third Hauser banged a bingle o ff
Dum ford s shins and Arthur scored
the tying run 
Two tallies that sewed up the evenings
entertainment in the eighth
called for some extra-heroical heroics 
which deeds were perpetrated by
Len Ellison on his smoking single to
left after Art Rudolph had survived
a boot at second The Merchant keystone
sacker counted on E Rudolph s
sacrifice fly to left giving Black River
a one run margin and moving Ellison
to second Here is where Hoard
came up A moment later the Richland
Center folks wished that Royce
had stayed at home The big backstop
nailed one flush on the nose and
before the Dill was retrieved Ellison
had scooted across the platter with
what proved to be the important run 
Royce s wallop proved to be just what
was needed to take the wind out o f
the foeman s sails

at the fair grounds here Sunday night
and gave the Center gentry the works
for a 4 to 0 goose egg job Only four
singles blossomed off Rudy s fireworks
and only one serious scoring
threat was issued up by the visitors 
that was in chukker No 2 when
Truesdale got as far as third after
two had gone to rest Another guy
sporting the title o f Durnford (which
is what we used to call our model
T ) got as far as second on a bunt
following his hit in the third And
that s about all that can be said for
the assault o f the opposing swatsmen 
Meanwhile the Merchants were
making runs while the mazdas burned 
Two Black Riverites spiked home
in the first Randles got the rally
going by being a spectator to four
inaccurate pitches Kleven beat out 
a slow roller to Henley Ward moved
to third as A Rudolph was forcing
Hank at second Art stole second to
set the stage for Len Ellison to blast
a hit into right Both Randles and the
Merchant second sacker counted on
Len s hit same being the gesture
needed to cop the ball game A third
tally wheezed across the plate in the
second in the person o f a gentleman
(blondes prefer em) named Adams 
Larry smashed a hit to Durnford who
found it was too dura hot to handle 
A hard hit by Randles fell short o f
the fence when it hit a light wire in
deep right Adams scored all the way
from first on the smash Randles was
also involved in the final tally by
drawing a pass in the seventh The
left fielder romped to third on Teeples 
hit to center and went home
when Shelby dropped Art Rudolph s
fly to center Though the enemy fielding
looked a little sleezy in a spot or
two three o f four Merchant runs
were counted on solid hits 
The victory over the Richland Center
aggregation here Sunday marked
the eleventh triumph in twelve starts
for the Black River Falls ball club 
the only loss being a 1 to 0 spanking
in the rain against the great Satchel
Paige outfit Seven straight wins
have been recorded since that loss 
Thursday the boys go to Whitehall
for a twilight game there and
have Blair on the docket in another
night game here Sunday This Blair
nine is reputed to have a number o f
able swatsmen in their cast which
should make it interesting to see
what these clouters can do to Rude s
fireball The game will be called at

Chucker Shaw an angular renegade
from Fairchild took the hill for
the Merchants in the Independence
day game o f the Centennial celebration
and curve-balled his way to a
neat 6 to 4 edge over a bunch o f
gents that advertise culinary tools
up Eau Claire way The reticent twirler
who has more curves that Fido
has fleas kept the Eau Claire hits
well scattered except in the seventh
when the enemy collected four in a
bunch and cashed them for three
runs At this juncture however the
Merchants had stacked up a six run
total so the little splurge served only
to make the game more interesting 
The viand cookers had gotten a lone
run previous to the seventh inning
flurry on a brace o f hits and a bobble
in the third This about sums up the
visiting attack 
Shaw himself started o ff a rally
in behalf o f his Merchant brethern
by slashing a bingle to center in the
seventh He was forced by Randles
who went to second as Kleven was
being retired by Tompkins Teeples
dropped a long double in left center
counting Ward Art Rudolph lashed a
single through short and Teeples
scurried across the dish with the twin
run of the frame but Art was nipped
trying for second 
Two more Black River fellers scampered
home in the fourth The business
was inaugurated by Hoard who
shot a honey o f a double against the
fence in center Royce counted on a
line single to center by Hauser who
promptly looted second Dale went to
third when Lesnick booted Neidfeldt s
grounder Ernie flashed the signal for
the double steal which materialized
nicely Dale sliding across the pay
station on the seat o f his bloomers
just under the return throw from
second 
The tally needed to win the ball
game was set up when the Kleven
boy drew a life on Blad s miscue at
first Hank moved up on an infield out
and counted on a scorching double to
right center o ff the club o f Art Rudolph 
The superfluous score came
over in the sixth on Niedfeldt s single
and stolen base and Shaw s second
hit That was all but it was nuff

The president succeeded in having
renewed his powers to further devalue
the gold dollar by nine cents Beyond
that he cannot go Whether or
not he will go to that limit is doubtful
under present circumstances If gold
continues to flow into our vaults at
the present rate in another year there
will be little left in the other countries
o f the world What gold will
be worth if that happens will be 
problem for the future Other coun
tries do not seem to be worrying
about it Silver was priced at 1 29
per ounce for currency purposes five
years ago Lately it has been 64
cents for our purchases When the
treasury stopped buying over the
Fourth o f July holidays it dropped to
38 cents per ounce in foreign markets 
What silver may be worth a
year or two since may be another
problem 
There s another currency coming
into vogue by force o f arms in Asia
which may cut as much figure as our
gold when Japanese conquests made
possible-by our materials and money 
shall become more extended It is the
reserve bank currency o f Japan It
now is the currency o f Japan Manchuoko 
Korea and that portion o f
China under Japanese control About
one-sixth the world s population now
uses this currency Its present value
is problemmatical Based upon our
own valuation of gold it may be
worth about $2 per bushel basket full 
but where Japan dominates it passes
at par It is paid in wages to the
Chinese forced to labor in mills controlled
by Japan The wage scale for
such forced labor is 10 cents per day
in that currency 
Given the resources o f eastern Asia
developed by cheap labor paid in such
wages with cotton silk iron steel
and materials o f every kind available
in China Japanese currency may become
the wage pay o f a billion people
or half the population o f the world 
Japan will become not only our competitor
in the world markets but that
o f all Europe as well What then will
be the value o f that foreign trade 
which all nations are seeking to obtain 
even at the cost o f a great war 
may make our gold valuation stabilization
fund and trade treaties far
different questions than those which
now concern congress 
The president s next fight in the
Senate will be over the proposed revision
o f the Neutrality law The
House did succeed in preventing the
repeal o f the arms and munitions embargo
desired by the president and
secretary o f state but there are many
senators who want a much stronger
neutrality and a wider embargo They
will seek to broaden the embargo to
include the many other materials 
such as iron oil copper cotton and
foodstuffs which are as essential to
warring nations as arms and munitions 
The senate may make a prolonged
fight against the changes desired 
The attempt o f representatives
from western dairy states to open the
Washington markets for milk and
dairy products from western states
has been held up by a filibuster by
members from the nearby districts
which now furnish the city s whole
milk supply The measure is being
contested at every step the big dairy
companies which control the distribution
o f milk in the capital city are
joining forces with the producers association 
Another attempt will be
made to pass the Schulte bill in the
House the coming week 
The milk supply o f Washington and
its suburbs with nearly one million
people is one o f the best sources of
profit to the dairy monopolies Fresh
milk sells at 14 cents per quart and
even buttermilk is sold at 12 cents
per quart In consequence o f these
high prices the consumption o f whole
milk is declining rather than increasing 
Not all the nearby farmers are
permitted to sell milk in Washington 
The inspection regulations o f the city
board o f health are so strict that
many farmers cannot abide by them 
Consequently the entire supply is in
the control o f about 1 300 farmers 
Within easy trucking distance from
the city there are over 100 000 farms 
Many o f them sell milk to other eastern
cities but they have not been
able to break the monopoly barriers
any more than have western farmers 
Western dairymen have been
barred by the same form o f board
o f health regulations which among
other things require that inspections
o f farms as well as dairies must be
made by city inspectors The average
western farmer lives too far away to
make such inspection possible It is
that system o f inspection and other
drastic requirements which have enabled
the few big New York City corporations
to control the whole milk
supply o f one-third the people o f the
country One such corporation sells 80
per cent o f the milk supply annually
to Washington people The officers
o f the corporations receive salaries
larger than that o f cabinet officers 
and still this one company was able
to garner about 400 000 in net profits 
last year

ETHIOPIAN CLOW NS BASEBALL CLUB
The Ethiopian Clowns present a
major league class o f baseball in
every respect some sports writers going
so far as to rate them superior in
the art o f national pastime 
to their big league professional adversaries 
The 1939 edition o f the visitors is
without a doubt the fastest team
touring the country this season each
and every player selected for his versatility
and natural ability to entertain
fans and sports followers They
have been equipped with flashy uniforms 
thus presenting the most colorful
appearing nine in baseball Their
rhythm is more perfectly timed then
a group o f jitterbugs struttin to
the tune o f a Cab Calloway swing
band Early comers to the park will
see the most dazzling exhibition o f
infield practice ever presented on any
diamond and this performance before
the game alone is worth the price o f
admission not to say anything about
the actual game that follows 
sociation o f producers supplying the
Washington market sells about 25 per
cent o f their milk as surplus In a
single season ten carloads o f surplus
cream were made into butter -They
demand freedom from western competition
for their whole milk and they
also demand the privilege o f competing
with western farmers in the production
o f butter and cheese 
Milk could be sold in Washington
at 10 or 12 cents per quart and the
farmers get even a larger pay for
furnishing it A lowered price would
naturally increase consumption and
improve general dairy conditions but
the monopolies are not interested in
general conditions so long as they can
reap profits running into hundreds of
millions annually by curtailing the
milk supply o f the larger cities 
The situation also brings added
competition to farmers who sell their
milk in the form o f butter and cheese 
To obtain larger amounts from their
dairy herds the nearby farmers who
share in the monopoly are increasing
their herds They receive the higher
prices for only a part o f the milk
which they supply and accept a much
lower price for so-called surplus milk 
That enables the big dairy companies
to manufacture butter and cheese
from the surplus supply and place
such products on their city markets
through their own system o f distribution
and without the added freight
charges and selling costs which western
creameries have to pay The as-
The special committee appointed to
investigate the milk marketing conditions
in Washington made caustic criticism
o f the monopoly system and
presented the Schulte bill which now
is up for passage Every investigation
into the practices o f the dairy monopolies
has disclosed the same unsatisfactory
situation In some instances 
graft and racketeering charges have
been made Every big city in the
country has conditions similar to
those in Washington In Chicago a
grand jury indicted 93 city and corporation
officials but for some reason
they have not been brought to
trial The people o f hundreds o f cities
are unable to obtain sufficient milk
for their children because o f such
milk control and practices Congress
may and should point the way to their
relief in passing the Schulte bill

The baseball fans o f the community
will have an opportunity o f honoring
one o f their heroes next Sunday
night The officials o f the Black River
Falls Merchants (including president
J T Wrigley) are setting aside
this game as Ernie s own 
This is simply a chance for the
fans to let Old Rude our star pitcher 
know that we appreciate his greatness 
And we appreciate the fact that
he has been very much in demand
with other clubs Even though the financial
inducements have been tempting 
Ernie has cast his lot with the
old home town and stays right here 
This year he is perhaps pitching
the best ball o f his brilliant career 
He has decisions over the Independence
and Whitehall clubs strongest
teams in the Western Wisconsin
league he has beaten Reedsburg
twice once by a shut-out and Reedsburg
is undefeated in the Scenic Wisconsin
League Richland Center from
the same league has also lost to him
twice once by a shut-out another victim
from still the same league were
the Wrend Builders o f Madison Then
he has taken in stride the Mint team
from La Crosse the Pressure Cookers
from Eau Claire and last but not
least the powerful travelling Giant
Collegians in ten innings Incidentally
he allowed this team only one
scratch hit in the last seven innings 
His only loss was to Satchel Paige
and his all stars and that was by 1-0
on a wet field that allowed none o f
the fancy fielding for which the Merchants
have become famous 
So that s nine won and one lost
and five o f the wins were shut-outs 
Add to Rude s accomplishments his
power with the war club and the
swell job o f managing he has done It
all amounts to this that the fans are
going to do honor to Ernest Rudolph
next Sunday night 
Blair will furnish the opposition 
there will be brief ceremonies at the
plate before the game and the stands
will be filled with baseball fans for
Ernie Rudolph night

The members o f the Lions Club
wish to make a public expression o f
their gratitude for the magnificent
and universal cooperation met with
in the planning organization and
carrying out o f the Black River Valley
Centennial and Homecoming To
attempt to list by name the organizations
and individuals giving such fine
help would be dangerous some one
most deserving o f our thanks might
be unintentionally left off the list 
Thanks to ideal weather immense
crowds attended the three-day celebration 
So far as we know every
activity connected with the event
went off without a hitch strong evidence
that all organizations and individuals
to whom certain tasks and activities
were delegated did their jobs
well and efficiently It is no secret
that man after man and woman after
woman badly neglected his or her own
business or home duties to make a
great success o f this affair these
same people may now feel well repaid
for their time and efforts in the
knowledge that Jackson county has
now commemorated the 100th Anniversary
o f its first permanent white
settlement in a fitting and proper
manner It may now be admitted that
the Lions club at first avoided the
task o f acting as general sponsor o f
the event when requested to do so
about six weeks ago not only because
o f the big risk involved but
also because o f the limited time left
to get the wheels in motion Now
we are all glad that the community
at large insisted that this year must
not pass without the birthday celebration
to which the year A D 1939 is
justly entitled

I cannot say and I will net say
That he is dead He is just away!
With a cheery smile and a wave o f
the hand 
He has wandered into an unknown
land 
And left us dreaming how very fair
It needs must be since he lingers
there 
And you O you who the wildest
yearn
For the old-time step and the glad
return 
Think o f him faring on as dear
In the love o f There as the love o f
Here 
Think o f him still as the same I say 
He is not dead he is just away

The citizens around Hixton are all
up in the air with enthusiasm because
there has been found in the Hixton
mill pond owned by H P Chenoweth
a nice large bed o f the original
Egyptian Lotus These flowers are
o f the same specie as those found in
the national famous beds at Trempealeau 
Wis There is at the present
time a large number o f buds that will
blossom according to the Indians the
last week o f July or the first week
o f August 
There are no doubt a number o f
people in Jackson county who do not
appreciate what it means to have this
bed in their courfty I will try at
this time to give sort o f a history of
this world-wide famous flower It is
one o f the flowers that is highly protected
by the government owing to
the fact that they are so rare There
is at present only two other beds in
North America on record There are
many beds o f Oriental and American
lotus but not Egyptian The Egyptian
Lotus flowers go back to the
time o f the great Biblical kings o f
Egypt The people o f Egypt worship
this flower and they are able to foretell
the future by them 
This bed at Hixton is located right
on both the State Trunk Hiways 95
and 27 They are about 30 feet
from the highway and can be easily
seen from one s car If you have
never seen them in bloom why don t
you drive to Hixton and see them
some day Bring your lunch and
spend the day in the Hixton park 
which is located on this small Take I
am sure you will be more than pleased
to see them People from every
state in the union travel to Trempealeau
every year just to see these flowers
and we the citizens o f Jackson
county are very fortunate to have
them so close to us A trip here will
be a thrill in itself
