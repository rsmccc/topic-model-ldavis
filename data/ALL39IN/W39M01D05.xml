   <p>Farm Tenant Loans Loans totaling more than 130000 have been made to 18
    Wisconsin farm tenants for the purchase of farms Loans were made during the
    first years operation in the state f the BankheadJones Farm Tenancy act as
    reported by state officials of the Farm Security Administration The primary
    purpose of the act says Arlie Mucks director of the Wisconsin branch of the
    Farm Security administration is to enable farm tenants shareholders and
    agricultural laborers to buy farms The act passed by congress following the
    revelation in the 1935 agricultural census that two out of every five
    American farmers did not own their farms The census reports also showed that
    more and more farm owners were becoming tenants Approximately onethird of
    these tenants it was estimated were movers every year t was recognized that
    farm practices associated with a shifting tenant population were not only
    working considerable damage to the farms concerned but that they were making
    the tenants themselves poorer and poorer Applicants for farm tenant loans
    are passed upon and approved by a county committee made up of three farmer
    members Borrowers it is explained are given 40 years by the law to repay the
    loans at three per cent interest Definite assurance must be given the
    committee that the applicant is able to handle the farm In every case the
    farm is operated under farm and home management plan which is designed to
    aid the tenant purchaser in making success of his farm Farms purchased in
    Wisconsin under the act average 116 acres in size compared to an average of
    130 acres for the United States as whole The average cost of farms in
    Wisconsin was 6774 as compared to national average of 4077 per farm A recent
    report from the state and federal crop reporting service showed that farm
    tenancy in Wisconsin is considerably less than the nations average The
    reason given is that the tenancy problem is more acute in the cash crop
    farming areas such as corn and cotton In Wisconsin the southern border
    counties where corn is the chief crop have the most farm tenants Fewer
    Strikes in 38 Wisconsin during 1938 had only one half as many strikes from
    labor disputes as in 1937 and the number of persons involved and the days of
    work lost decreased even more said the states 19mo4th old labor relations
    board in its first annual report Strikes have been of short duration and
    have been ended by agreement usually representing compromise settlement Said
    the report Wisconsin has been very fortunate in having virtually no
    bloodshed in the very disturbed labor conditions which have prevailed during
    the past two years In Wisconsins four neighboring states there has been loss
    of life in labor disputes and in each state the militia has been called out
    at least once The board composed of three members appointed by thc governor
    and sanctioned by the legislature has settled 528 cases involving 111496
    workers through mediation since it has been operating Up to the end f
    November 855 cases were closed by the board and only 172 of these involved
    strikes In addition of 367 cases charging unfair labor practices which were
    settled by November 30 only 51 complaints charging employes with violations
    had to be issued and in only 23 of these cases was it necessary for the
    board to render formal decision Of the 23 onethird were found in favor of
    the employers Of the unfair practice cases 85 per cent were settled without
    formal proceedings and of the rest in which formal complaints were issued
    more than onehalf were settled without the necessity of formal decision by
    the board The report pointed out That this fine record in the main is due
    neither to the law nor to the board It is a reflection of the very
    reasonable ttitude of the majority of the Wisconsin employers employes and
    union mem bers and labor leaders of the state as well as of the general
    public That the board was mildly worried about threats of the incoming
    legisla ture to change the labor relations act! was indicated when the
    report stated] Abandonment of the general policy of the labor relations act
    would result not in better industrial conditions but rather in more
    disturbed conditions The New Gymnasium A visit at the new gymnasium this
    week discloses the fact that it wont be long before it is ready for use It

    increased state aids for maintenance of county trunk highways will be acted
    upon by county highway officials and county board members at the annual road

    r w n th rn in best commerce secretary ever politica l observers think the

    Democrats (Hopkins Solicitor General Jackson Interior Secretary Ickes Brain
    Truster Corcoran) and middleoftheroad Democrats (Vice President Garner
    Postmaster Gene ral Farley Secretary of State H ll) A month ago when Homer S
    Cum ings retired as attorney general C hairm an Farley warned that his
    potent political organization would be swung to one side or another
    depending on who was named to succeed Mr Cummings By choosing Solicitor
    General Bob Ja ck son President Roosevelt would show leftwing tendencies and
    thereby lose Farley support As it happened the commerce vacancy appeared and
    was filled before Mr Roosevelt got around to the attorney generalship so
    thispost became the weathervane Mr Farleys current opinion That President
    Roosevelt by nam ing Mr Hopkins is boosting him for the presidency in 1940
    that Bob Jackson the alternative for 1940 will be named attorney general
    that some New Dealer like Michigans exGov Frank Murphy may get Supreme court
    post If this happensand the wind is now blowing in that direction Farley
    Hull Garner et al w ill bolt from the New Deal Whether the President dares
    to thus bite the hand that feeds him is doubtful Vice President Garner
    carries tremendous prestige in the 1 South im Farley runs the most
    tremendous powerhouse in S history Cordell Hull is the New Deals most
    popular cabinet member with Democrats and Republicans alike If these men
    bolt there is possibility that either 69yearold Mr Garner or 67yearold Mr
    Hull will head presidential ticket in 1940 with Farley as running mate T
    ransfportntion Last autumn President Roosevelts railroad factfinding
    committee ruled against wage cut to help sorely pressed carriers on the
    ground that its benefits would be only temporary But this did not m inim ize
    the problem of high operating costs vs low income and the President agreed
    to ask congressional consideration for any readjustment program railway
    anagement and labor might offer Therefore just as congress prepared to open
    sixman committee offered its plan indirectly laying part of the
    responsibility at the Presidents own doorstep The comm ittees explanation of
    rail troubles (1) governments favoritism to competitors such as barge lines
    (2) lack of centralized transportation regulation The remedy Regulation of
    all forms of transportation by (1) the interstate commerce commission which
    would fix rates regulate services valuation and accounting and (2) an
    independent transportation board which would handle all other regulations
    Also recommended is a federal transportation court to handle reorganization
    plans In addition the committee offered four other complaints which could be
    remedied by legislation It asked removal of restrictions on F C loans to
    carriers repeal of the longandshort haul rate clauses (whih prevents rails
    from charging a lower rate for long haul than for short haul over the same
    route in the same direction) elim ination of low rates for government
    freight and discontinuation of government operated barge lines Briefly
    carriers want less red tape and more efficient government regulation over
    their industry Aainst President Roosevelts probable approval of the general
    prog ram observers stack Montanas Sen Burton Wheeler chairman of the
    interstate commerce com ittee Chief comments to date come from President
    John Pelley of the Association of American a ilroads who calls the report
    the most comprehensive and constructive ever made and President Alexander F
    Whitney of the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen The Whitney opinion Its just
    another smoke screen to tickle the public chin Defense The satisfaction of S
    speechmakers from denouncing Nazi Germany is equalled only by Nazi Germ an
    ys satisfaction in making reply Yet each outburst and retort invites wider
    rupture of the already strained GermanAmerican diplom atic relations started
    during November when each nation withdrew its ambassador over the Jewish
    persecution issue Returning from Europe just as protests and replies were
    charging from Berlin to Washington and back Illinois Sen H amilton Lewis
    commented that the U must stop its hate wave against European dictatorship
    must instead substitute peace through conciliation and conference What
    prompted Mr Lewis statement was the remark week earlier by Secretary of the
    Interior Harold S Ickes to the effect that Henry Ford and Col Charles
    Lindbergh should be ashamed to accept a decoration at the hand of brutal
    dictator (Hitler) who with the same hand is robbing and torturing thousands
    of human beings Result was a German protest followed by the state
    departments refusal to apologize This latter action was contrasted with the

    messiah has appeared in Grigore Gafencu 47yearold World war flier named as
    um an ia foreign in ister Once an influential Bucharest newspaper an Gafencu
    has long advocated closer cooperation among YugoSlavia Hungary and Bulgaria
    thereby averting dependency on either Germany or Italy Germany Since German
    policies began antagonizing world democracies the obvious prediction has
    maintained that German foreign trade would suffer It then follows that
    Germany m ust increase her domestic production to become independent of
    foreign imports The difficulty of the task was first emphasized in late
    November when Col von Schell was named general plenipotentiary of the
    automobile industry to speed production and standardization and institute
    necessary economic measures few days later Dr a rl Lange was given sim ilar
    powers over Germ anys machine industry Next came Dr ritz Todt as general
    plenipotentiary in charge of all road building Such industrial czarships
    smell am azingly like communistic Russias commisar system and the idea was
    probably borrowed from that good neighbor To give the entire system added
    impetus Dr Walther Funk salesmanlike economics inister has been named czar
    of all Germ an industry with supervision over Herren von Schell Lange and
    Todt Always closely supervised erm an industry will now feel official
    domination even more severely How an apparently communistic method of
    industrial overlordship will work in nation which still supports private
    enterprise remains fo be seen G rm ny foreign trade has suffered In 1937
    Germany built up a favorable balance of 168000000 In 1938 this was wiped out
    and imports were 159200000 more than exports Great Britain A solidified
    empire is the United K ing dom goal since NaziFascist states began
    threatening her position Among the empires weakest features is the string of
    miscellaneous possessions centering in the Caribbean sea who individually
    and collectively have thus far received too little attention from London One
    of them Jam ic recently heard agitation for annexation by the S Still more
    recently it was suggested that Great Britain ight pay its 4000000000 war
    debt by ceding her Caribbean islands to the S Belatedly recognizing some

    onetime Negro slaves who depend chiefly on agriculture Main trouble point
    the past year has been Kingston where a royal investigating commission was
    recently welcomed by strike of gas workers throwing the entire city into
    darkness WASHINGTONDaniel Roper leaves tough spot and an enigma for
    Washington The answer to the enigma ay come before very long and it will be
    worth studying Actually that answer ill forecast the future not only with
    respect to the attitude the administration will take towards business but
    even as to the probability of third term for President Roosevelt It so
    happened that the final forcing out of Roper came just after publication of
    magazine article ZgSf ty Gen Hugh S r K Johnson which discussed the third
    term possibility and p e i t d that Roosevelt would turn a little to the
    right in order to make Gen Johnson certa his renomination and reelection
    This Johnson article aroused no end of bitter comment in Washington not only
    because of his frank characterization of many of the New Dealers as
    crackpots but because of his prediction that an overwhelming flood of
    returning prosperity would come within three weeks after John Nance am r
    became President! The New Dealers of course do not concede that an
    administration such as arner would conduct would result in prosperity But
    they object even more violently to the idea of G arner for President
    Obviously they do not want any such exodus of crackpots as Johnson predicts
    would occur if Garner became President They would much rather have an exodus
    of the Garners Department of Commerce Does Not Regular Business In the
    policies to be carried on by the new secretary of commerce there is not so
    much interest as one m ig t think Actually there are other branches of the
    government which are of much more interest to business For example the
    trustbusting division of the department of justice For example the
    securities and exchange commission For example the ICC the federal trade
    commission the WPA the PWA yes even the TVA Actually the department of
    commerce is not menace to business It does not regulate business It does not
    decide on the taxes that business will have to pay It makes I any studies
    and gathers lot of data which is of value to business especially on exports
    and imports But even on that it is of nothing ! like the importance to
    business that the tariff commission is and does not compare to the
    reciprocal trade ? treaty negotiating division of the state department But
    nevertheless the appointment of secretary of commerce is of j enormous
    importance despite the comparatively drab and workaday j functions of the
    department he will head Not by any means because i of the actual acts that
    the secretary j of commerce will perform but be cause his mere selection is
    hint as to the attitude of the President So it makes lot of difference
    whether the post is filled by man whom business men regard as a I witch
    burner or whether the ap I pointment goes to m an to whom i business
    generally feels friendly j No More Foreign Loan I If ill Be Slogan This
    ffinter No more foreign loans will be the slogan on Capitol Hill this winter
    Congress is all set to be isolationj ist as far as Europe is concerned 1 It
    is all set to be extremely friendly I to the other countries of this
    hemisphere It would even be willing to fight to prevent foreign aggression
    south of the Rio Grande But I it is not illin to risk another dolla r of ta
    p y r money on loans to any foreign government or to individuals in any
    foreign country either for trade developmentthe idea Secretary of the
    Treasury Henry M orgen th au Jr is toying with ! or for building up their
    own national defense This last idea seems to be strong in im where the
    LatinAmerican countries that favor the new version of the Monroe Doctrine
    which m igh now be called m utual defensive alliance are rather intrigued
    with playing their own part That part of course as far as one can learn here
    to be financed from Washington Loans for trade development were always
    popular in New York and in big manufacturing communities There is selfish
    interest as big as a barn door to explain it Much of the 1927 1928 and early
    1929 prosperity was built on foreign loans Out in tne country if one is to
    bei lieve returning congressmen there is very different attitude There is
    very keen recollection of the foreign bonds that defaulted and there is
    considerable resentment against those the folks out in the country hold
    responsible In fact this was one of the highly significant causes of the
    tremendous flop in the prestige of Herbert Hoover The casual observer thinks
    of American investors as some restricted class living mostly in old eastern
    cities Lets look at particular instance involving these defaulted foreign
    bonds Bank Depositor Stung by Defaulted Foreign Bonds It so happened that
    the city of Pocatello Idaho had considerable deposit in local bank Under the
    law the citys funds were protected more rigorously than the deposits of
    ordinary citizens It was required that sound bonds be earmarked in the banks
    vault as a special guarantee Came the bank holiday and the city officials
    wanted to know about the city funds Where are the bonds protecting them ?
    they demanded The bank officials sadly showed the city officials just what
    they had done They had earmarked certain bonds of South American republics
    as being the collateral of the city deposits But why should you have treated
    us like this? the city officials protested Why did you put worthless bonds
    behind our deposits? The bankers explained that on the advice of federal
    bank examiners the bank had bought these foreign bonds Not only that they
    had sold at loss some irrigation bonds which the bank examiners seemed to
    think nothing of The bank examiners had lists of bonds they considered good
    and these foreign bonds were on it This was not an isolated instance
    Depositors all over the country ranging down to obscure hamlets were
    penalized by this craze of the Washington government to loan money abroad
    The point is that the folks knew it then and remember it now And their
    congressmen know all about it Ifont SenatorElect Taft on Senate Finance
    Committee A quiet campaign is under way to make Senatorelect Robert Taft a
    member of the senate finance committee In many ways the finance committee is
    the most important in the senate It decides on all tax questions and handles
    all tariff bills Normally freshman senator does not aspire so high f he
    makes this committee or appropriations or foreign relations in his first
    sixyear term he thinks he has made real progress To make the Taft ambition
    all the tougher it so happens that no Republican member of the finance
    committee fell by the wayside this year As matter of fact only one of them
    was up this year That was Jam es Davis of Pennsylvania who won both his
    renomination and reelection fights handily Other Republican members of the
    committee are rthur Capper of Kansas Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan and John
    Townsend of Delaware Sen Robert La Follette of Wisconsin is also m em ber
    but is classified as Progressive instead of as Republican In the last
    session there were 16 Democrats on this committee only four Republicans and
    one Progressive It remains to be seen what concessions will be made to the
    Republicans in committee assignments due to their increased strength Having
    the majority the Democrats can do anything they please But the probability
    is that the Republicans will get at least two more members of this committee
    There are eight new Republican senators and it just so happens that two of
    them replace Democratic members of the committee Democratic losers Are
    Replaced by Republicans Taft replacing Sen Robert J Bulkley is one of these
    The other vacancy was caused by the defeat of Sen Augustine Lonergan of
    Connecticut Both states have been conceded almost a vested interest in the
    finance committee due to the days when the most im portant function of this
    committee was framing tariff bills as both states rank Sen ukev high in
    their manufacturing interest and hence ore vitally interested in the
    protective tariff Other states sending Republican senators to replace
    Democrats are New Jersey New Hampshire Wisconsin South Dakota Kansas and
    Oregon Wisconsin can be eliminated as far as the Taft candidacy for the
    finance committee is concerned because it already has one member of the
    committee in La Follette New Jersey which is sending Warren Barbour back to
    the upper house is normally considered as ranking high in its claims to
    voice in the finance committee but nothing like so high as Ohio and there is
    no word that Barbour is making bid for the place Obviously the other states
    are not so much entitled to consideration because of population wealth or
    manufacturing interest as Ohio Kansas already has Republican member of the
    committee Arthur Capper ? Bell SyndicateWNV ervlc All Around WISCONSIN

    fixed look Will you take me for walk this afternoon Miss neeland? he asked
    her begin to feel the urge to know all about this region and its traditions
    want to see the Lovers Leap and the Water all and the Wishing Spring There
    isnt any Lovers Leap or Wishing Spring Joan said practically Then well make
    some Weve simply got to have them Whoever heard of cam in the woods that did
    nt have little things like that? How about right after lunch little stroll
    from two to four would suit me down to the ground Rex let his tongue have

    liked his irresponsible chatter W ll make It two to three she said What this

    admitted SI 11 we say the livingroom from four tn five? Mrs Spencer Fnrbes
    nodded See that you dont wear him out In the meantime shr warned Joan She
    strolled out ol tlie diningroom with the air of havirg no further use for
    either of them The walk was sliuht disappointment to the young an The wood
    paths of which there were many were so narrow that two could not walk
    abreast in them flaw Hale at once discovered and referred to critically The
    road was too rough for good walking They went forward in single file
    perforce and Jo an (howed her companion rather perfunctorily the spots where
    she w planting wild flowers He expressed admiration also perfunctorily She
    was aking him feel that his voice could not reach her across the vast gulf
    between them They dont thrive she adm itted The soil is too sandy Nothing
    does well in it but these evergreens W ll have to get some richer earth for
    them and bring it here I ll help you Hale promised m quite gardener wrote an

    them unless Im confused by seeing flowers on the trees Pomegranates mixed me
    up badly It was so hard to tell where the tree ended and the flowers began A
    re you ever serious? Joan asked suddenly N t if can help it ll try to be if
    youd rather w as She shook her head No Its pleasant change to have someone
    around who isnt worried and unhappy Rex who was leading stopped short turned
    and faced her M iss Kneeland he asked very seriously Why are you worried and
    unhappy? For an instant he thought she was about to tell him She hesitated
    then hedged Why is anyone anything else? she asked How can anyone be? t very
    odd to hear you say wretches like me slave in the hot city It was almost
    hundred in New York today dont believe its more than sixty here this inute
    even with the fire ve worked in my shirt sleeves all day and with my collar
    off B t think of the reward sir Aisworth purred o llin up more millions in
    your great factory while poor devils like Hale and Craig and me wonder how
    were going to pay our laundry bills The effect of the comment was immediate
    and striking It stopped Kneelands outpourings as thoroughly as if it had
    been hand on his mouth He frowned and turned to the flre Banks came in with
    cocktails Kneeland aroused himself and drank two Hale spoke of his woodland
    walk No one was interested or pretended to be In despair he threw
    conversation ball to Mrs Spencer Forbes She could be depended on to catch
    and return it while there was life in her They all went in to dinner while
    she was giving her impressions of Mrs Wilbur Nash The impressions were witty
    and entirely merciless Miss Hosanna said u h ! and smiled forgivingly Mr
    Kneeland checked his sisters warning discourse on raw oysters with lifted
    forefinger I was just saying that this is the life! th t he told her You
    have so much to live for Have I? That shows how much you know about it She
    had closed door in his tace and had closed it definitely Gone was the
    understanding of those moments in the sea and on the float only few hours
    ago He took his cue m rather cheerful myself he said easily t natural came
    back to America feeling forlorn and expecting to be at loose ends all summer
    Then everything changed with rush called on your uncle he invited me here
    and here am Its incredible luck She gave him strange look D you think so? Do
    you really expect to be happy at Halcyon C am ? O course do Then be happytf
    you ca He turned in silence and continued the journey along the narrow path
    repentant voice came from behind him was beast It said Im sorry Do be happy
    really want you to be Thank you Y u know she went on slowly youre so
    cheerful when all the rest of us are so down that ita a sharp contrast
    Sometimes it a pleasant one Sometimes its a strain see Neither spoke again
    for some time Then Joan returned to the subject of the wild flowers They
    both held to It as to blazed trail till they got back to the house Kneeland
    came for his weekend the next day which was Friday Hale was in his own room
    when his new employer arrived Sometime after six he heard Kneelands car cr
    one he assumed was Kneelands making its difficult way along the impossible
    road He suppressed an im pulse to go down stairs and meet his host They
    would have plenty of meetings no doubt between now and Monday morning He
    descended at seven for the cocktails he had learned were served at that time
    Everyone was there as usual dressed for dinner Casper Kneeland was talking
    rather pompously as Hale entered the livingroom He stopped long enough to
    shake hands and mutter perfunctory greeting Then he went on impressively was
    just saying that this it the life he declaimed Here you all are cool calm
    and comfortable sitting around fire and hearing the and Joan asked her uncle
    if he would take her out in Berts motorboat the next day if Bert would lend
    it He said he would but that it would be crime with three young fellows
    around the house eager to do it Ainsworth remarked pleasantly that he was
    very fond of motorboats but that he had never been able to afford one No one
    paid any attention to him Hale was talking with an almost desperate sense of
    the need of doing so and Joan and Herbert backed him up Mrs Spencer Forbes
    tossed in an occasional remark that was like a firecracker thrown into small
    grate The talk was almost animated Even Craig was suddenly moved to take
    part in it Something that was said by Herbert reminded him of peculiar
    psychiatric case on which he discoursed at great length It fascinated
    Ainsworth but did not appeal to Herbert or Joan Both listened to it in blank
    silence Hale checked further medical remirfiscences by resolutely engaging
    Mrs Spencer Forbes and Joan in an argument about book all three of them had
    read It worked but he palmed his brow as he left the table It had been ?
    hard job to keep those people going He had experienced ceaseless undersense
    that something wat wrong In the livingroom Joan was already seated between
    Miss Hosannt and her uncle In desperation Hale drifted toward the piano M st
    you ting old a ? Ainsworth asked anxiously know you always had the urge at
    Ithaca but I thought you might have lived it down m worse than ever Hale who
    had had no notion of singing till then resolutely sat down before the
    instrument He had a pleasant barytone voice fairly well trained and he could
    play well enough to accompany himself without annoying his hearers He sang a
    Spanish love song Joan rose and came to the piano anticipating the action of
    Mrs Spencer Forbes who obviously had the same impulse like th t Joan said
    Sing another please He made room for her on the long piano stool and she sat
    down beside him He sarg two more songs and then played few Spanish melodies
    as an undercurrent to their talk They said nothing of interest but it was
    pleasant half hour At the end of it Casper Kneeland got up came over to them
    and dropped a hand on ales shoulder Glad you have some parlor tricks my boy
    he commented Theyll brighten us up Just now I want you lo come to my study
    for a ch t In the study Kneeland waved Hale to an arm chair uttered few
    platitudes offered the young an cigar and took one himself When the cigars
    were lighted and drawing well he looked at Hale in frowning silence Rex
    waited He had long ago learned that when something important was to be said
    it was well to let the other fellow do the prelim inary talking He actually
    dreaded the first sentence for he had a premonition of what it would be It
    was what he had expected Kneeland brought out Well what do you think of s?
    Hale laughed This is the fourth time ve been asked that questionand ve only
    been here fortyeight hours Who were the other three? Aisworth was the first
    think He would be Kneeland commented grimly Who were the others? Mrs Spencer
    Forbes and Mrs Nash There was nothing personal in the question think They
    were simply making ta lk Perhaps But m doing more than that want to know
    what you really think of the people here Well sir since you put it that way
    can only say they dont hit me as quite normal Theyve all got something
    serious on their minds Most nf us have but we usually have the power to
    throw it off at times These people havent They seemI suppose obsessed is the
    word want Perhaps thats too strong Perhaps it holds more than mean But
    theyre all under high tension Y u mean theyre all worrying about something?
    Not necessarily In fact hardly at all Ainsworth certainly isnt worrying HeS
    having grand time worrying everybody else Craig is entirely selfish and
    selfcentered 1 suppose hes out for success and cant think of anything but
    that Certainly he doesnt seem able to talk about anything but the hum an
    brain and its vagaries Still dont get the feeling that hes worried (TO Ut

    the shore of Ireland Finding the boat in which he was rowed outstripped by
    others he cut of! his hand and flung it to shore to touch it before those in
    adance could land When Jam s forfeited the ONeile esttites in 1611 and

    Miss Carlisle averages nine hours sleep night She is equally religious in
    her exercise and has de veloped her own method for specific exercises When 1
    do an exercise that makes me sore then know Ive hit the right muscles for
    that spot she explains One of Miss Carlisles favorite exercises is designed
    to benefit the arms and shoulders You place one clenched fist in the palm of
    the other hand and then hold the hands at chest level elbows out at either
    side Push against resistance and force the hands first to one side then to
    the other As for keeping the waistline slim and the tum y flat heres the
    exercise recommended by this star Lie on the back on the floor with hands
    braced at either side and flop both feet back over the head Keep the knees
    straight legs together and slowly lower the feet back over the head until
    the toes are on the floor The trick is to lower the legs very slowly and if
    you can do that you are not so rusty on exercise after all Return to the
    original position and repeat the exercise three times Largest and Smallest

    said counties have also been aced with highway maintenance cost because of
    the public demand for dustfree and iceless roads od WPA News Best news of
    the week for Wisconsins 78000 WPA workers was State Administrator Philip
    Planners announcement that there would be no cutting of WPA rolls in January
    About month ago state WPA officials were told to slash rolls by 5000 during
    December Further reductions were expected in order to make present
    appropriations last until March But Flanner said last week There will be no
    more orders for cuts unless I get specific instructions to do so I believe
    will not have to make arbitrary cuts in January Meanwhile with the coming of
    winter the state relief load increased 54 per cent in November over the
    previous month the public welfare department announced The increase however
    was smaller than usual for this time of the year said the department A total
    of 8X1972 was granted for relief during November 128 per cent more than the
    amount granted the month before The new legislature was urged to act
    promptly to meet relief needs in the state by J Thelen secretary of the
    Wisconsin County Boards association Thelen said that only 168000 remains of
    the 3 million appropriated by the last legislature to help counties pay
    their relief costs This balance is not enough to meet relief expenses for
    another month Thelen estimated The money is under the control of the
    emergency board which appropriates the money to needy counties to help them
    meet their relief costs IRed Car Buyers The motor vehicle division of the
    state department calls special attention this week to state law which
    requires that new owner of used automobile must forward his certificate of
    title to the secretary f the state with 1 fee within five days after
    purchasing his car Use of the license plates with the car is not valid until
    the title has been recorded with the state department it is pointed out The
    department also had warning for automobile dealers telling them that holding
    up certificates of title until all liens are paid by the purchaser is
    illegal and makes both the purchaser and dealer liable to prosecution They
    ask all dealers to also turn in all certificates of titles for vehicles that
    are junked or dismantled serve as San Franciscos fairground in 1939 and its

    nivertal and e te rn e a a e U io Before Baby It Born But not every mother
    realizes what all nutritionists knowthat to not inconsiderable degree the
    very foundations of good health for the child are laid down before he is
    born For it has been well said that good nutrition for the infant begins
    with good nutrition for the mother Un o t n t l many people even in this
    enlightened age still cling to superstition and old wives tales when it
    comes to choosing the proper foods for those important months before baby is
    born It is important to pay special attention to the amount and kind of
    protein that is eaten since over the entire period the baby grows
    tremendously even though almost half of the weight of the newborn child is
    added during the final two months before birth Recenf investigations also
    indicate that the prospective mother is best able to maintain her
    nutritional reserve if the amount of protein in her diet is carefully
    calculated It is desirable likewise that the protein be of the highest
    quality Milk is even more important in the diet of the expectant mother than
    in that of other adultsnot only for its protein but because of its minerals
    and vitamins As a rule the expectant mother should take quart of milk day
    whereas the usual diet for adults calls for pint of ilk daily minerals to
    help construct bonea and teeth it is also important to include in the
    prospective mothers diet an adequate supply of vitamins itamin is essential
    if the calcium and phosphorus are to be utilized properly and it has also
    been indicated that vitamins A and are likewise most important at this time
    The mineral iron is also required in significant amounts and this may well
    be obtained from eggs dried fruits whole grain cereals and green leafy
    vegetables It has been found that the thyroid gland is unusually active in
    the expectant mother And in those sections of the country where the drinking
    water and soil are deficient in iodine physicians frequently recommend the
    use of some food such as iodized salt Some Common Fallacies As result some
    expectant mothers overeat frequently of the wrong kinds of food others do
    not take enough of the foods that are required to aintain top health for the
    mother and build the babys body soundly while still another group believes
    such antiquated notions as the idea that a woman may eat whatever she craves
    during this period In view of the fact that recent nutrition work has given
    us more knowledge than ever before of how and what the expectant mother
    should eat dietetic errors during this period are particularly deplor able
    Minerals and Vitamins In addition to requiring protein to help build tissue
    for her baby the expectant mother must have a generous amount of minerals
    Calcium and phosphorus are required especially for the formation of the
    babys bones and teeth Construction begins on all the teeth before birth and
    at birth all 20 of the first set are completely calcified within the jaw
    Besides providing the necessary Adequate Bulk or Cellulose It is most
    desirable that enough bulky foods be included in the diet to help maintain
    regular health habits This requirement should be taken care of automatically
    if generous amounts of fruits vegetables and whole grain cereals are
    consumed For in addition to their minerals nnd vitamins all these foods
    likewise supply bulk which aids in promoting regularity The wide use of
    fruits and vegetables will also help to build up a liberal alkaline reserve
    which helps to safeguard health during the period of gestation If all these
    factors are taken into consideration the expectant mother will not only help
    to pre serve her own health but will take constructive measures to give her
    baby the blessings of sound start in life Then as the healthy contented
    infant grows into the healthy happy active toddler and later becomes the
    healthy welladjusted school boy the mother can indeed be proud of her
    handiwork! (c) WNU Houston Goudias 193S44 Building Better Babies Every
    expectant mother should be under the care of physician and usually he gives
    specific advice concerning the foods that may be eaten and those that might
    better be avoided But every woman will be better mother if she understands
    something of j the functions and fate of foods with particular reference to
    this period Dont Overeat Generally speaking the same foods that are required
    for wellbalanced diet under ordinary ircumstances are the ones that will
    best serve the needs of mother and child during the months before a baby is
    born There are however certain modifications of the diet that may well be
    taken into consideration First word about the amount of food consumed It is
    not necessary to eat more than is required to satisfy the normal appetite in
    the belief that large quantities of additional food are needed Nutritionists
    have demonstrated that the energy requirements of the expectant mother
    increase only during the last three months of gestation Thus it is not
    necessary to increase the caloric intake for the first few months though
    toward the end of the period a gradual increase in caloric intake may be ade
    under the direction of the physician It Is advisable however to emphasize
    that the character of the additional food consumed as well as the amount
    should always be taken into consideration well that you should have it in
    flat crepe or polka dot print as well as in tubfast cottons like calico
    percale gingham and linen The Patterns No 1652 is designed for sizes 36 38
