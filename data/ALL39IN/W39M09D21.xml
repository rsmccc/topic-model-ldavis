FORTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1939 NUMBER 45
Cigarette Tax Adopted
After months and months of debate,
Wisconsin’s 1939 legislature has
agreed on a tax bill, but the bill as
passed falls 18 to 2 0 million dollars
short of balancing the budget.
The tax bill, which Governor Heil is
expected to sign early this week,
places a two cents per package tax on
cigarettes and reenacts the 60 per
cent surtax on incomes. The former
is expected to raise 5Vfe million dollars
and the latter $4,800,000. The cigarette
tax was estimated to bring in 6
million dollars, but the estimate was
based on the assumption that the tax
would go into effect Ju ly 1.
Because of the failure of the adopted
tax measure to raise sufficient funds
to balance the budget, it will be necessary
for the legislators to find other
methods of meeting state expenses before
they adjourn. There has been
considerable talk of the legislature adjourning
this week or next, however,
many observers and legislators are
convinced that if new tax measures
must be enacted the session will continue
for another month.
The need for additional tax measures
brings about more rumors of a
sales tax. Last Friday, Assemblyman
Anthony Gruska announced that he
would introduce a bill calling for a 2
per cent sales tax which would raise
enough money to balance the budget
and also pay back 50 per cent of the
amount collected to local units of
government for real estate tax relief.
Assemblyman Frank Graass will also
present a new tax bill (a revision of
the bill he brought out three weeks
ago) which would raise 1 1 million
dollars by increasing income taxes for
individuals and corporations and
enacting an estates tax.
State Budget Picture
Enactment of the flrst tax bill by
the legislature was accompanied without
any earmarking*'for special purposes.
At one time or another thc
cigarette tax funds were to be used
only for relief, with the state pav'ng
from 15 to 2 0 per cent of all relief
costs. The senate also at one stage
earmarked all income from the 60 per
cent surtax for old a?e pensions. The
final decision was to place all cigarette
and surtax funds in the general
treasury.
The necessity for n^w tax measures
is evident from the following table:
Budget a d o p te d ................. $68,000,000
Relief n e e d s ....................... 4,000,000
Increased p e n sio n s ............ 3,250.000
Bang’s Disease program .. . 750.000
Total ............................. *76 000.000
Present state in c om e ........$15,000,000
Reenactment of dividend tax 3,000,000
Reenactment of 60''/ surtax 4.800,000
Cigarette t a x ..................... 5.500.000
Chain store t a x ................... 300,000
(Still pending)
Total ............................. $58,600,000
Approximate shortage $18,000,000.
Pension Bill Passes Senate
The $40 per month maximum pension
bill has been passed by the senate
and will receive special consideration
from the assembly this week. Thc bill
will increase the state’s appropriation
for pensions by about 3H million
dollars. Pension experts expect the
increase to add about $2 . 0 0 per month
to the average pension grant. The
federal government will pay half of
the costs.
The senate before giving final approval
to the bill by a 27 to 1 vote
(Senator White of River Falls cast
the dissenting vote) killed off amendments
which proposed to make the
minimum grant $40 and which would
have relieved counties of paying any
of the pension costs. The county now
contributes 20 per cent, the state 30
per cent and the federal government
the balance. Under the new bill the
county would pay 15 per cent, the
state 35 per cent, and the federal
government again 50 per cent.
Over-Ride Governor’s Vote
The assembly for the first time this
session over-rode a veto by Governor
Heil. The vote which needs a twothirds
majority was 50-21.
The bill in question would force the
state highway commission to maintain
city and village streets which are
a part of a state highway system.
The bill was backed by the Wisconsin
League of Municipalities and would
apply only in villages and cities having
a population of 2500 or more.
League officials state that the law already
compels the highway commission
to maintain streets in villages
and towns with a population under
that figure.
Governor Heil in his veto message
explained that the bill would cost the
state too much and would cause many
disputes. League of Municipalities
officials argue that heavy traffic has
caused the ruin of city streets which
sre a part of a state trunk system and
that the state should contribute to the
maintenance of these roads as well as
those outside of the village or city
limits.
Before the bill can become a law it
also must receive a two-thirds vote
by the senate.
Capitol Notes
Governor Heil named Leonard
Kleczka, Milwaukee attorney and
former member of the board of
regents, to the board of University of
Wisconsin regents. Kleczka was
named after the senate had refused to
confirm the appointment of Judge
Backus of Milwaukee. He was unanimously
confirmed by the senate.
The senate also unanimously confirmed
the appointment of Col. George
Rickeman, Racine, as commissioner of
the new motor vehicle department for
a term of six years.
Governor Heil has vetoed the bill
which would reestablish the Farm and
Home credit administration. The bill
called for an appropriation of $69,500.
Governor Heil stated that nearly all
of the foreclosures in the state were
Federal Land Bank actions and that a
state body would be of little help.

Rev. Fierke Accepts Call
to Pastorate at Frederic
The Rev. George F. Fierke, pastor i
of St. P aul’s Lutheran church since in
July, 1915, has accepted the call recently
extended to him to become:
pastor of a congregation at Frederic, |
a village in Polk county.
At a meeting held Monday evening,
the members of St. Paul’s church by a>
vote complied with his request for a j
peaceful release.
The Rev. Fierke will begin work in |
his new field in the week of October 8 .
After that the Rev. Droegemueller, of j
Birnamwood. will be the vacancy |
pastor pending the selection of Rev.
Fierke’s successor.
Rev. Fierke was a conscientious and
successful worker during the 24 years
that he labored as pastor of the local
congregation and he also had a keen
interest in community affairs. He was
at one time coach of the high school
basket ball team and his 1917 squad
won state renown by winning top
honors at the tournament held that
year in Madison.
The departure of this estimable
family from this community will be
regretted by many people both in and
outside of the congregation and all
wish him happiness and continued success
in his new field.

Obituary— Mrs. Melvin Irwin
Funeral services for Mrs. Melvin
Irwin, who passed away at Fairview
Hospital in Minneapolis on Sept-ember
1 0 after a long illness, were held at
the Enga funeral chapel in that city
last Thursday afternoon with the Rev.
Hedin, pastor of a Swedish Lutheran

name was Celestine Houglum, was
born in Minneapolis on November 23,
1901, the daughter of Rev. and Mrs.
P. P. Houglum. She came with her
parents to this village in 1905 and
lived here for six years, during the
time her father was pastor of First

Lou and Ralph; her parents and three
sisters: Bergitte (Mrs. William Lakvold),
of Glaslyn, Saskatchewan, Canada,
Pemille (Mrs. Knut Jenson) and
Petra (Mrs. J. K. Weiser), both of

SUPER HIGHWAYS
The important Thomson highway
bill which sets up a nine year program
of about 1,900 miles of state highway
construction at a cost of 70 million
dollars has been passed by the assembly
and sent to the senate.
No new appropriation is necessary
under the bill. Each year 2Mi million
dollars from state highway revenues
and 2 million from federal aid money
would go into the program. The
balance would be made up by counties
from highway allotments they receive
from the state, but in no case is the
county’s share to exceed 50 per cent of
the cost.
A specified list, of roads outlined in
the bill must be constructed before
other new state roads can be built. A
total of 148 projects are listed. Vernon
Thomson, author of the measure,
says the program is designed to cover
gaps and replace obsolete and inadequate
roads which now carry a large
volume o f traffic. He declares it
would give W’isconsin the finest network
of highways of any state in the
union.
Notice to Afl Methodists
Station WLBL, Stevens Point, will
broadcast the program, “ Heralds of
Destiny,” on Thursday at 11:15 a. m.
This is a program of highlights in
Methodist history. Don’t fail to hear
this interesting and educational program.
This Girl Knows All the Answers
How tall was Abraham Lincoln?
Did he use a single or a double-bladed
axe to split those famous rails? How
many stars were there in the American
flag in his Springfield, Illinois, jack
leg lawyer days?
These were only a few of the hundreds
of questions which the 2 0 th
Century-Fox property department
hurled at Frances Richardson, head »f
the studio’s research staff, while working
on Darryl F Zanuck’s production
of “Young Mr. Lincoln,” showing Sunday
and Monday at the local theatre
with Henry Fonla in the title role.
And Miss Richardson came right
back at them with the right answers,
to wit: 1.— Six feet 4 inches. 2.— Both
3.—Twenty-five.
Mr, and Mrs. Harry H >ppe and

Compulsory Military Training
A regular visitor to Wisconsin legislative
halls, the measure providing
compulsory military training for university
male students, is back again.
The new bill, quickly passed by the
senate and sent to the assembly, where
a determined minority succeeded in
holding it tip from immediate action
by having it referred to the judiciary
committee, provides that all first and
second year male students at the university
be compelled to take Reserve
Officers Training Corps work. For
the last five sessions similar bills have
made their appearance and have all
failed to become law. Military training
has been voluntary at the University
for the last 16 years.
The usual pro and con arguments
were expounded before the senators
passed the measure. Opponents objected
to the compulsory feature, and
opposed teaching “ the art of killing at
a state university.” Proponents claimed
the training was healthy and taught
discipline, and upheld the importance
of a well trained, prepared civilian
army for the United States.
" o m ” Contributed Hu 'Spud
One of our villagers was a visitor in
Eland recently and stopped in at the
Enterprise office with this unusual
tale:
Watching eagerly for the train to
Marshfield, on the station platform,
stood a dog, tail wagging. When the
train puffed to a stop, the eager dog
approached the baggage car, where he
was evidently known by the baggage
man who asked him if he had his pass.
The dog barked. The baggage man
lifted him into the baggage car and
asked him if he were hungry. The intelligent
beast barked and sat up,
begging to be fed.
Interested by the dog, the gentleman
from Wittenberg made inquiries about
him and learned ,that he is owned by
the depot agent at Marshfield. He has
doggy friends in Eland and every so
often hops the train and rides to Eland
to spend a day. Visit over he goes to
the depot apparently knowing the time
of his train’s arrival. He has made
frle p j* with the baggage man; so
when his train stops, he goes t.> the
baggage car, enters, and rides back to
Marshfield to his master. The dog has
also been known to jump on a flat car
of a westbound freight to get home.
And this is another proof of the intelligence
of man’s best friend--a dog.
# * *
We dislike the implications in the
caption World War No. 2 in our newspaper
accounts of the present war in
Europe. Is the Press trying to swing
public sentiment to our entering the
war? Certainly in a headline “ World
War No. 2” there is no neutrality be
cause in a World W'ar our country
would figure. Emphatically we would
beg our citizens to withstand th
propaganda that might involve our
country in a war to settle the old
hatreds of the old world— for those
hatreds cannot be overcome by war.
Regardless of our personal sympathies
as to the conflict in Europe let
us stAnd together in our desire foi
Peace. After all, we the people have
some voice in so vital an issue as our
declaring war which will involve our
lives and our property.

invitation is twofold, first to see the
activities o f their children in the
classroom, secondly to see the new
classroom addition and also the gym,
for those who have not as yet had the
privilege.
Classes from 7:00 to 9:00
The classes regularly scheduled for
Wednesday morning will meet instead
from 7:00 to 9:00 Wednesday evening.
From 9:00 to 9:30 the band will rehearse
in the gym. This will not be a
concert but a demonstration of how
a regular scheduled practice is conducted.
The kindergarten children
will meet from 7:00 to 8:00 and the
lower grade music classes from 8 : 0 0
to 9:00.
People driving to the building may
park between the Gym and the Agriculture
building on a space provided
for that purpose. Cars should not be
parked on the street in front of the
building during school hours as this
creates a traffic danger for children
crossing the highway going to and
from school.

Goose Chase. The Seniors started out
at 7:45 and laid a trail through woods,
farm lands, and over roads which
eventually led back to school, the start
of the chase. The Juniors, as the
foxes, followed the trail; but since
they were not able to catch the
Seniors, the geese were the losers and
thus furnished the geese with a very
delightful lunch.

High School baseball team defeated
Rosholt 7— 4 and tied Scandinavia 3—
3. At Rosholt the boy* came to life
and pounded the offerings of Olstad,
Rosholt pitcher, for 13 hits and 7
runs. Mason in the meantime held
Rosholt to 5 hits and 4 runs.
At Scandinavia Tuesday it was a
slightly different story. Ringstad held
Scandinavia well in check, allowing
only 2 hits, except for walks which
kept him in trouble throughout most
of the game and which accounted for
sill of Scandinavia’s runs. Wittenberg
collected 6 hits off of Hellestad, but
could not hit when there were men on
the bases. This game will be played
off next spring.
Friday Wittenberg plays Birnamwood
here, and Tuesday plays Tigerton.

Lineup
As day after day passed into history,
the War of 1939 engulfed more
nations and brought more millions
face-to-face with dread actuality. On
Britain's side came the Union of
South Africa, one-third of whose 30,-
000 European population speaks
German. A few days later C anad
a’s Prime Minister Mackenzie King
ordered a declaration of war published
in the Canadian Official G azette.
After 10 days of fighting,
the lineup found Germany and her
ally, Slovakia, with 90.600,000 population
against a total ally population
of 505,556,000. The figures:

Still aloof were the imponderables.
Egypt, treaty-bound to B ritain,
had severed diplomatic relations
with the Reich. Turkey, also
treaty-bound, called up her reserves
as France’s Gen. Maxime Weygand
reached Ankara. But the greatest
imponderables were Russia and It aly,
both leaning Germany-ward,
whose jum p to Adolf H itler’s assistance
could place France and B ritain
in an extremely uncomfortable
position.

Past-master at the art of propaganda
is Germ any’s Dr. Paul Joseph
Goebbels, whose technique after

jecturing. Ministries of information
worked at such a snail’s pace that
the London Daily Mirror commented:
"The m ills of the Gods grind
ilowly, but seemingly those of the
air ministry are geared even more
slowly.” Soon radiophotoing of news
pictures was banned by London,
leaving U. S. readers with nothing
but Germ an propaganda photos.
Meanwhile the British propaganda
office gave correspondents such patently
cooked-up stories as one that
the ex-Kaiser had warned Hitler he
faces disaster.
Herr Goebbels was smarter, if
more unethical. His radio stole a
Warsaw wave length and warned
the Poles to evacuate. But he did
allow U. S. correspondents to visit
the front and released announcements
which were acceptable to the
press because they were partly true,
and more damaging for the same
reason.
But the m ajo r war of words came
from Germ any’s Field Marshal H ermann
Wilhelm Goering, who swore
at Britain and cooed at France, renewing
the well-substantiated rumor
that Germany will be ready for
fried line did Adolf Hitler withdraw
several divisions from Poland and
rush them westward to the rescue.
As the second week got under
way, two salients and counter-offensives
seemed brewing into two m a jor
battles. (See Map). The first
was near Saarbrueken, where a
French offensive pointed eight miles
into German territory. To the west,
Nazi troops sought tc relieve this
pressure and possibly reach
France's highly touted Maginot line.
Meanwhile, just north of Switzerland,
French troops pushed into the
Black forest hoping to open a path
via Austria to sorely pressed Poland.
In Rome m ilitary observers
chuckled over this offensive, knowing
full well that France had originally
intended to aid Poland via
highly vulnerable Italy, which decided
instead to stay neutral.
Eastern War
As war in the east reached its
second week, Adolf Hitler released a
masterpiece of understatement: By
decree, Germany's far eastern frontiers
were restored to their 1914 positions
(See Map). Since Germany
had already regained about twice
the area she lost in 1919, some naive
observers may have wondered why
Der Fuehrer continued his march
to Warsaw. But while he was about

Western War
In 1914 it took two weeks to start
a real dogfight on thc western front.
The War of 1939 proved no exception.
In the first seven days allied
troops made steady gains, “ feeling
out” the enemy on all parts of the
front. But not until the allies had
dug in almost to the recessed SiegEASTERN
FRONT

it. Hitler had evidently decided to
take a little more, plus ali the land
Poland got from Austria-Hungary in
1919.
This was no easy job. Blustering
and boasting of the w a r’s first days
was silenced as Poland lived up to
her promise. The retreat had really
been strategic, after all. Moreover,
Marshal Edward Smigly-Rydz really
had about 1 ,0 0 0 , 0 0 0 unused troops.
As the Poles dug in behind the Bugg
and Vistula rivers, London heard
that the eastern front’s greatest battle
was growing on a 250-mile front.
Even Berlin communiques admitted
“ fierce battles.”
Biggest of P oland’s unspoken worries
was the juggernaut at her back
door, Russia. Thousands of reserves
poured through Moscow bound for
the west after mobilization was decreed
“ in connection with the German-
Polish w ar.” Was the Red bear
about to strike, too?
Next day Moscow’s Pravda said
no. Russia was merely preparing to
disarm and interne eastward-fleeing
Poles when the war was over.
ff ar at Sea
Still a mystery was the whereabouts
of Germ any’s giant Bremen,
which left New York one day before
war was declared. Reports
placed her variously at Iceland,
Mexico, South America and Russia,
but she was probably snug in a
Spanish harbor. M anhattan’s waterfront
still housed the French Normandie
and British Queen Mary,
probably there for the duration.
Though British and French lines no
longer announced their schedules,
the He de France sneaked into New
York. Two British boats, the Georgic
and Samaria, sailed in darkness.
This was fool’s fun unless convoys
awaited the allied vessels when they
left neutral waters. After one week
of war 1 2 British-French boats had
reached Davy Jones’ locker as the
Reich’s submarine campaign began
gathering force. Sm all victory for
Britain was the fact that all Germ
an shipping had run to cover; unless
allied boats could sail the seas
there might be a repitition of 1917’s
near tragedy. In that year convoys
were perfected.
War at sea could not fail to touch
U. S. shipping. The Manhattan and
other boats left for Europe with
giant flags painted on their sides.
New York brush wielders did a
landoflrtce job camouflaging allied
vessels. Off Cobh, Ireland, the liner
Washington rescued 33 crewmen
from the torpedoed British freighter,
Olivegrove.
But U. S. shipping was a breathholding
business. Painted flags
meant little in mined waters. Besides,
other neutral nations were beginning
to suffer: ( 1 ) A Dutch mine
sweeper hit her own mine and sank
with 33 aboard; (2) a Greek freighter,
Kosti, was reportedly destroyed
by a German mine in the Baltic; (3)
Danish fishermen, fearing mines,
clung ashore.
D O M E S T I C :
Backfire of W ar
As Europe’s m ilitary machines
got up steam, Franklin Roosevelt
found himself puzzling over two conflicting
problems: (1) How to keep
out of war and preserve U. S. business-
social normalcy; (2) How to
prepare against war, yet be ready
for it when and if it comes.
Neutrality and Normalcy. P a ra doxically,
commodities, stocks and
bonds soared despite food surpluses
and the present neutrality law,
which automatically clam ps an embargo
on arms shipments to belligerent
nations. Reason: Wiseacres of
Wall street, most of them anti-
Rooseveltian, were pretty sure the
President w’ould summon congress
to repeal the present neutrality law
and substitute “ cash-and-carry.”
After a week of m ild ly effectual
warnings to profiteers, the cause of
normalcy was still suffering. Meanwhile
the White House played a
waiting game, holding a congressional
summons in abeyance until
public opinion had crystalized.

WASHINGTON.—There m ay have
been more curious positions in which
allegedly neutral nations have found
themselves than the United States
now occupies with respect to the
present war in Europe, but the most
studious of diplomats are unable to
remember an example.
Diplomats were a bit surprised at
the fervor of President Roosevelt’s
fireside chat with the nation. He
followed very closely, they point out,
the pattern of Gen. Hugh S. Johnson’s
speech a few days before as
1 to being neutral in fact, but not utral
in thought.
Johnson was a little blunter. He
m ade no bones about the imp ibil-
I ity of not being against a nation
w’hich uses force instead of persuasion,
which has no regard for its
word, and which threatens the peace
of the world every time it wants
anything. Roosevelt was m uch m ild er.
But he also mention. J the use
of*force, and admitted that he could
not ask the citizens of this country,
as Woodrow Wilson had done in 1914,
to be “ neutral in thought.*’
There was another bit of Roosevelt’s
address which was generally
approved by the partisans of Britain
and France, and was gall and wormwood
to the pro-Nazis This was his
insistence that there should be no
profiteering on any commodities
which the men, women and children
might need in the war-stricken
countries.
As mere words these are not unneutral.
But when it is realized
that Britain and France can buy
all of these commodities in the United
States that they want, allowing
for certain losses through submarining
of the supply ships, but that it
is practically impossible for G e rm any
to be so supplied, the evenhanded
justice disappears.
S u i n g to P re s id e n t's S id e
S in c e W a r B r o k e O u t
There is some doubt now, on this
same point, whether the embargo
provision of the neutrality act applying
to “ arms, ammunition and
implements of war” will be repealed.
The President wanted that
very m uch during the last session.
| He could have had his way if the
repealer could have been gotten to
a vote in the senate. It was obvious
that there were enough opponents of
repeal to talk the change to death.
So, in the desire to reach adjournment,
it was abandoned.
At the time inside administration
j officials figured, on the basis of their
knowledge of the situation in E u rope,
that the odds for war were
about three to two. How’ever, they
also figured that if the embargo
could be repealed the odds would be
reversed, thus becoming three to
two against war.
There is no doubt that there has
1 been a swing in sentiment toward
the President’s side since the war
| broke out. It is just a question of
how m an y “ incidents” it would take
to so inflame the country against the
Nazis that the only question w’ould
be when the United States would get
into the war on the side of Britain
and France.
B u t it would be a simple matter,
now, to force through the change the
President has wanted. There are
some senators still who believe it
would be virtually an act of war,
and calculated to get the United
States into the war, but there are
not enough of them to make a strong
filibuster—with no date for the ending
of a session agreed upon.
C o n s id e r N a t io n a liz a t io n
O f t h e E le c tr ic In d u s t r y
Nationalization of the electric industry
is one of the first moves
planned by New Dealers when and
if the United States becomes involved
in the war. The only question
is whether congress would be
willing.
B ut the inner circle is not worrying
about that question. There is
no thought in the minds of the left
wingers that, in the rush to give the
administration every power it might
ask for war purposes, control of
such a vital element as power would
not be included.
In the last war it was the railroads.
But the motive, as well as
the situation, w'ould be different. In
the first place, while some of the
then heads of the administration
m ay have hoped that the government
would operate the railroads
forever, most of the driving force,
including the thought of President
Woodrow Wilson, was for returning
the railroads as soon as the emergency
was over.
This time the allegation that taking
over the electric industry was
necessary* for war purposes would
be an excuse, not the real reason.
I The real reason is that insiders in
the administration are firmly convinced
that government ownership
of the electric industry would be a
real blessing for the people of the
country as a whole.
There is another important difference
in the situation of the railroads,
during that terrible winter of
1917-1918. and that of the electric
industry today. In the World war
tne Li. , tes i r Irnads almost
collapsed. Meanwhile the weather,
plus trucks for whose* weight and
power the roads had not been calculated,
had m ade the highways sorry
substitutes for the steel roads.
The rush of getting our own troops
and supplies to A tlantic seaports,
plus the necessity for keeping up
that vital flow of supplies to the
hard-pressed allies, was terrific. So
the government took over the railroads.
G o v e r n m e n t C o n t r o l L e ft
R a ilr o a d s i n B a d S h a p e
But consi(’«?r for a moment what
was the chief reason why their taking
over by the government was so
essential. It w-as to get the roads
out from under government regulation!
So long as the roads were in
private hands any collusion, any exchanging
of services, any agreements
that A w'ould handle this territory
and B that, while C would
handle only through business, w'ould
have been frightful affronts to the
interstate commerce commission. In
fact, such practices would not have
been tolerated for a moment.
It never occurred to anyone, of
course, that this could have been
solved by the simple decision by
congress that for the period of the
emergency all restrictions except as
to rates and safety were abrogated.
Yet after the war no one denied
that the only advantage from government
operation was this shortcircuiting
of federal regulation. In
fact, there was a terrific rush to get
the roads back into private hands,
and there is little doubt that if the
war had continued much longer the
stupid inefficiency of government
operation would have more than offset
the advantages of removing government
regulation.
So obvious and true was this,
along about the tim e the roads were
handed back to their private owners—
in such bad shape that they
have never fully recovered—that
several ardent government ownership
advocates moaned that this unfortunate
experience had “ put the
cause of government ownership back
for 50 years.’*

There is no discounting the efTect
of the Mississippi gubernatorial prim
ary on the possible nomination of
President Roosevelt for a third
term, if the Chief Executive decides
he wants a third term. Victory of
Pa ul B. Johnson, on a pro-Roosevelt
ticket, and with the support of
Sen. Theodore G. Bilbo, over form
er Gov. Martin S. Conner, who
had the support of Sen. Pat H arrison,
is highly important in calculating
the stand that the Mississippi
delegation may take at the Democratic
national convention next
June.
Bilbo has been an out-and-out
third-termer for Roosevelt. H arrison
has said little on the subject,
but his plain sympathies have been
with the group of Southern Conservatives
including Carter Glass and
H arry Flood Byrd of Virginia, Josiah
W. Bailey of North Carolina,
“ Cotton E d ” Ellison D. Sm ith of
South Carolina, and Walter F.
George of Georgia.
For many years the practice of
the Mississippi democracy has been
to put both its United States senators
on the delegation it sent to national
conventions. But also for time
out of mind the practice has been
to bind the delegation by the unit
rule. This means that the 18 votes
she casts at these party assemblies
must be cast all together, and that
how they are cast is determined by
a majority vote.
So while Senator Harrison may be
one of the delegates, and in fact
probably will be a very influential
one, it is also probable now that the
friends of Bilbo and Governor Johnson
(as he will be then) will be
able to muster a majority of the delegation.
Which means, unless something
unforeseen should happen, that
Mississippi’s 18 votes will be cast
for the renomination of Franklin D.
Roosevelt.
R e se rv a tio n s T h a t M u s t
B e G iv e n C o n s id e r a t io n
While this is the obvious political
deduction from the prim ary, especially
in view of Johnson’s very
large m ajority considering the size
of the vote, there are a few reservations.
For one thing, it must be remembered
that Harrison did not
make any speeches in favor of Conner,
and, that despite the knowledge
that Harrison was for him,
m any of Harrison’s friends have
never forgiven Conner for his race
against Harrison last time Harrison
was re-elected to the senate. Conner
at that time made slurring references
to the way P at spent his
time in Washington, giving the im pression
that he was often on the
links of the Burning Tree Golf club
when he should have been tending
to the interests of Mississippi at the
Capitol.
Another factor is that, according
to various polls, sentiment among
the Democrats of that section does
not approach a m ajority for a
Roosevelt thifd term. So the question
is whether Johnson, and for that
m atter Biibo, will take that side
of the question next year.

SYNOPSIS
C a p ta in C a rl Norwood has been sent from
his n ativ e E n g la n d to the K a d u r R iver distric
t in In d ia , along with his Indispensable
m an serv an t. Moses O 'L e a ry , soldier of fo rtune.
Norwood's jo b is to survey the d is trict
to d ete rm ine whether a v aluab le secret
d iam o n d min e belongs to the temp le priests
or to the ruler, the M a h a r a ja h of K adur.
Norwood calls on the B ritish Residency to
p a y his in itia l respects. O n his way he
catches a glim p se of two women in a palace
ca rria g e , one of whom is young and b e a u tifu
l The other w om a n he knows to be the
M a h a ra n e e of K a d u r. O 'L e a ry later tells
h im tha t the young w om an is an A m e rican
g ir l n am ed L y n n H a rdin g , who w ith her
a u n t. Mrs. D eborah H a rdin g , is a guest at
the palace. O n a sightseeing tour Mrs.
H a rd in g spra ins an ankle, and sends to the
p a lace for a id . P rin c e R u n d h ia , handsome,
spoiled nephew of the rulers, comes to her
rescue.
fast as Lynn. And then Rundhia
stood in the way, smiling, careful
not to embarrass Lynn with gallantry.
“ Nothing,” he said in English, to
the Maharanee. “ A twisted ankle.
A bruise. A little badly shaken I
believe. My doctor is attending to
her. Won’t you introduce me to the
goddess?”
The Maharanee purred. She unveiled
her face. She put her arm
around her lam plit protegee:
“ Lynn darling, this is my nephew
Prince Rundhia. He is a bad boy,
but I do# hope you will like each
other. Rundhia, this is Miss Lynn
Harding, w'ho is teaching me how
Americans do things; and I am having
such fun pretending she is one of
us. I w’ish she were! Oh, how I
wish it.”
Presently, when the doctor came
out, Rundhia eyed him in the lam plight
with a stare that made the
Bengali flinch. He did his best to
look like a confidential, dignified retainer,
but it didn’t work. Aunty had
broken his dignity, and his fear of
the Prince had no covering left. He
almost stammered:
“ Nothing broken. Tape—iodine—
bandages. She will soon recover.**
He made a sudden, nervous effort to
regain the feeling of being important
and on the inside of events.
“ Have you heard that Captain Norwood,
of the Royal Engineers, has
arrived? He is in cam p outside the
city.”
Rundhia looked startled. The doctor
continued:
“ He has with h im an Eurasian
named Moses O ’Leary who, they
say, already is poking his ugly nose
into what is none of his business.”
Lynn Harding stood examining the
Rolls-Royce. She was quite used to
luxury, but even Hollywood owned
nothing like that thing. Its gadgets
and gold-plated adornments were a
sufficiently good excuse for giving
Aunty’s temper time to cool off. So
she lingered, letting the Maharanee
go alone into the guesthouse. Aloneness,
of course, included three servants,
but a Maharanee is lucky
who endures only six eyes to watch
what she do'js, and six ears to hear
what she says. Lynn could not hear
what Prince Rundhia was saying to
thc doctor, but he was doing all the
talking and she felt fairly sure that
he was talking about her.
He strode toward her looking as
deadly self-assured as Mephistopheles.
Lynn fell on guard.
“ You win,” said Rundhia.
“ Win w h at?”
“ Whatever you came for.”
“ I came for a good tim e .’*
“ Uh-uh? Been having it? ”
“ Yes. Your aunt has been conducting
me into Indian mysteries.”
“ We have none,” said Rundhia.
“ We are an open book. We are
three hundred and fifty million people,
every sirigle one of whom carries
his heart on his sleeve. You
are the mystery. Have you a heart?
Where is it? ”
Lynn laughed: “ Is that any of
your business?”
“ Of course it’s m y business.**
•‘Why?”
“ Because you are the most beautiful
mystery I have ever seen. E v ery
mystery is an invitation to find
the right key.”
“ Oh, are you a detective?’*
“ You bet I am. I ’ve detected
your cruelty. You intend to keep
me guessing. I can’t endure it.”
Lynn laughed again: “ Should I
pity you?”
“ No. Pity and compassion are
the twin curses of India. We’re so
compassionate to one another that
we hate one another for not being
even more miserable than we are,
so as to be able to mop up greater
floods of useless pity.”
“ So you’re an iron m a n ?”
“ No—nor a jellyfish. I have a
leathery disposition, due to talents
; that have dried from lack of use.”
“ Oh, are you lazy ?”
I “ No. Iron has entered into me.

I t ’s like a spur that dug too deep
and keeps on working inward. It
irritates abundant energy that has
no outlet. Add boredom to that,
and what have you?”
“ It sounds like an explosive m ix ture.
Aren’t you afraid you may
blow up? I believe you’re sorry for
yourself.”
“ Sorrow is not in me,** he retorted.
“ I don’t know the emotion.”
“ Not even when you make mistakes?”
“ I never make them. A mistake
is what a fool does to an opportunity.
All that I have lacked until now is
a real opportunity.”
Mrs. H arding’s voice came
through the guesthouse window
sharply impatient:
“ Lynn! Lynn! Where are you?”
“All right, Aunty. I ’m coming.”
Experienced tyranny knows countless
ways of compelling submission.
Aunty groaned on a sumptuous bed:
“ No, don’t let me trouble you.
Don’t let me be a nuisance. I am
sure that the cares of a palace must
be more than enough. You must
try to forget m y existence. Lynn
can look after m e.”
Lynn’s eyes met the Maharanee’s
—-deep unto deep. The Maharanee
looked rather like a New York Eastside
Jewess who has risen through
the ruck of im m ig ratio n to the ranks
of affluence and prestige. Full-bosomed,
matronly, kind, but aware
that the world is full of pitfalls:
aware that the world needs kindness,
but can misinterpret and cruelly resent
good intentions. She had the
genius, gentleness, iron. She had
also a will that no Deborah Harding
could bully to obedience.
Lynn undid a necklace from the
palace heirlooms, and handed it to
the Maharanee. She began to remove
a bracelet, but the complicated
fastening prevented. She held
out her wrist.
“ Please. I must get into some
clothes that Aunty thinks respectable
and stay with her.’*
The mild, plump Maharanee countered
with surprising firmness:
“ Darling, we will expect you to
dinner. Yes, I will take the jewelry
because it must be returned to the
Keeper of the Jewels. I will choose
two women from m y own attendants
who shall take care of Mrs.
Harding.
She almost flounced out, giving
Aunty no time to reply. There was
silence until the drum-beat of the
horses’ hooves died away along the
drive in the direction of the palace.
Then Aunty spoke:
“ This comes of making social concessions.
I never heard of such
audacity. Did you hear her speak
to me as if I were a servant or a
charity patient? Go and take off
that immodest costume. It suggests
a fancy-dress ball in a bad house.”
“ Aunty, the doctor has promised
to return with something to relieve
the pain, so that you will get some
sleep.**
“ Sleep! While you are doing what
in the palace? Do you think I am
deaf, blind? Do you think I have
forgotten your flirting on board ship
and in hotels until »I blushed for
you? I heard you, through the window,
talking to Prince R u ndhia.”
“ Aunty, I think I hate you. It
makes me feel mean and ungrateful.
I would so much rather love
you.”
“ I have left off hoping to be
loved,” said Aunty. “ I demand
your respect. That may teacn you
to respect yourself and so merit
the respect of your equals. Love?
Gratitude? Illusions! I have learned
that.”
Lynn went and changed into black
I silk Chinese pajamas. They w'ould
remind Aunty of that fancy-dress
ball on board ship, when the penniless
son of a Tirhoot planter had
made the pace so hot that Aunty
Astronomers of the late Nineteenth
and early Twentieth centuries
spent some 40 years disproving
the discovery of a new planet
between Mercury and the sun,
writes Dr. Heber D. Curtis, director
of the University of Michigan observatories,
in an article in the
Michigan Alumnus Quarterly Review.
During the total eclipse of 1878,
says Dr. Curtis, two bright, starlike
objects near the sun were observed
by Michigan’s Prof. Jam es
Craig Watson, one of America’s
leading astronomers and, according
to former President Jam es B. Angell,
the most brilliant m an ever
graduated from the University of
Michigan. The existence of a planet
inside the orbit of Mercury had long
been predicted by theoretical astronomers,
he writes, although the
body had never been seen. Watson’s
observations, therefore, he
says, were heralded as the discovery
of a new member of our planetary
fam ily . Confirming Watson’s
discovery, he adds, were the observations
of Prof. Lew'is Swift, who
saw one of the bodies only a few
| seconds later than Watson during
| the same eclipse.
Not u ntil the observations of the
total eclipse of 1918 did scientists
give up Watson’s discovery as a
mistake, although no one had ever
been able again to observe either
of his two intram ercurial bodies.
During each eclipse from 1878 until
that time, astronomers set up and |
ran intramercurial cameras in the I
search for Vulcan, as the "theoret- i
Acal” planet had been named.
“ These famous observations of
Watson’s,** Dr. Curtis asserts, “defy j
any satisfactory explanation. Perhaps
as probable a theory as any is i
that he saw a moderately bright *
comet with an almost stellar nu- 1
cleus.” The relatively strong illum ination
of the sky background, he
explains, would have prevented the
detection of a tail, while the failure
of astronomers to find the comet
after it had left the immediate vicinity
of the sun is explained by the
fact that all comets enormously de-
| crease in brilliance as they leave
the sun, and a small one observed
near the sun might never be seen
again because its light would diminish
by hundreds of times within ;
a short time. While this theory may
| explain one of Watson’s mtramercurial
objects, says Dr. Curt no
explanation ha;> been ottered Ior U*e ,
i other.

Lynn Karding had been becoming
troublesome. The skillful tyranny
of A unty’s moneyed fostering had
forced Lynn to postpone the natural
rebellion of youth to an age at which
some girls are steadying down.
L y n n’s rebellion had hardly more
than begun. Aged twenty-two, she
had been denied the democratic
grace of college education.
Aunty, who held the purse-strings,
knew that colleges corrupt; and
what Aunty knew, was so. No one
could change A unty’s opinions. Lynn
had n’t tried to change Aunty. But
she had learned to be strategic and
even diplomatic. She had assented,
without enthusiasm, to become engaged
to a decadent F .F .V . But
there, Aunty’s first reverse had
caught her completely off-guard. An
im movable will and an irresistible
explosive met. Lynn blew up. She
d id n ’t merely break the engagement.
She smashed it. She scattered
its splintered fragments recklessly.
So Aunty beat a strategic retreat.
She decided on a world tour. It
had been fairly successful, barring
occasional incidents on shipboard
and in hotels. The almost incredibly
beautiful Lynn had received
enough attention from unpedigreed,
or at any rate uncertified, strangers
to keep Aunty on the war-path.
The British officers in India had
given Aunty plenty to worry about.
So the invitation from the M aharanee
of Kadur had come like a
godsend. It gave Lynn a romantic
outlet for enthusiasm in impeccably
respectable surroundings, where
there were no undesirable men to
ruin A unty’s dream of a correct and
socially influential marriage.
So this Prince was a staggerer.
He had been absent when the H ard ings
arrived, frequently mentioned
but not expected to return for several
weeks from what was spoken
of as a vacation. Aunty had had a
good look at him in the full glare
of the headlights of the Rolls-Royce.
He was a worse shock than the undignified
bruise and the twisted ankle.
He resembled one of those
young Argentine plutocrats who
used to corrupt Paris until the price
of beef and wheat reduced them to
the level of common mortals. A
splendid figure of a man, perfectly
tailored. Manners that only money
can buy and cynicism support.
Beautiful eyes, without a trace of
effeminacy and not yet betraying
signs of having lived too furiously.
An all-conquering male. Heir
to a throne as old as E ngland’s.
With astonishing strength he lifted
Aunty from the earth and placed her
on the soft-springed cushions that
mode her sigh with physical relief
and mental horror. Aunty knew she
was up against it. The Prince drove
her with skill. He avoided bumps.
He damned the guard at thc palace
front gate with the voice of a cultured
gentleman and a vocabulary
that Aunty instinctively knew was
scurrilous. At the arched entrance
to the guesthouse patio, he lifted
her out. He caused servants to come
like firemen to a burning house. He
sent immediately for his private
Bengali doctor, a member of his
own household.
“ Competent, Mrs. Harding, I assure
you. Discreet, I guarantee.”
Almost simultaneously with the
arrival of the Bengali doctor, who
looked devilishly discreet and more
afraid of Aunty than if she were
the devil’s own widow, the M aharanee’s
carriage drew up, with its
horses’ noses snorting on top of tht*
Rolls-Royce.
Out got Lynn, too full of excitement
and alarm and fun and sympathy
to remember she should veil
her face. She could hear her aunt
throMgh the open guesthouse w-indow.
Lynn came running into the
glare of R u nd h ia’s headlights.
“ Who are you? W’hat is wrong
with A unty?”
“ Your aunt has hurt herself. My
physician and some women are exploring
for broken bones. I believe
it is nothing serious.”
Aunty, It was obvious, thought otherwise.
She wasn’t liking the doctor.
She was calling him a fool,
and she could make the word sound
like a description of a flunkey caught
Stealing.
The Maharanee had to be cerem
onially helped out of the carriage.
She, too, hod heard Aunty’s yells.
She w’as overflowing with eagerness
to overwhelm an injured guest with
kindness, but she couldn t rup u*
“ Wonderful! But no, that
won’t d o !’*
nearly had fits. Lynn stared at het
own reflection in the mirror, not
quite liking it. She smiled at her- j
self, just to see what the smile ,
would look like.
The Maharanee returned from the j
palace, excited, fawned on by four j
women. Two meek men-servants \
followed her with baskets of provisions.
Lynn ran to greet her. The
Maharanee almost squealed at the
sight of Lynn in black pajam as with
her golden hair massed in becoming
contrast.
“ Wonderful! But no, that won’t
do! Yes it will, yes it w’ill! I forget.
I am so excited, I forget! We are
to have an informal supper party at
the palace, instead of dinner—truly,
truly unconventional — modern — a
p icnic!”
“Oh, my G o d !” said Aunty.
But the Maharanee could be as
deaf as Fate when it pleased her to
be. She continued, almost breathless:
“His Highness my husband** (she
always spoke of the M aharajah as
His Highness my husband) “ has
heard that Captain Norwood is in
Kadur. Captain Norwood is a Royal
Engineer. He is said to be a man
of great attainments. His Highness
my husband is very eager to bt
pleasant to h im .”
“ Engineer?” said Aunty.
“ Yes, he is to make a survey of
the Kadur River. It would not be
etiquette to notice him until after
he makes his formal call, which he
should do tomorrow. However, 1
persuaded His Highness m y husband,
who is a very conventional
man, but now and then he listens
to me.” She turned to Aunty: “ We
are so, so sorry, Mrs. Harding, that
you can’t be with us.”
“ I will spare you that regret,M she
answered. “ I will be there. You
have a rickshaw? Your women can
help me to dress, I don’t doubt.
Lynn and I will be leaving as soon
as I am fit to travel. A last supper
in your palace will be something
to remember.”
“ Oh, how gracious of you,** said
the Maharanee. “ But are you quite
sure—”
The Bengali doctor appeared, cautious,
with a bedside confidential air
that did not, however, prevent the
Maharanee from instinctively veiling
her face.
“ Mrs. Harding, I have a little pellet
for you, just one little pellet,
prepared specially.”
“ Thank you, I don’t take pellets.”
The doctor hesitated. The Maharanee
spoke through her veil:
“ Mrs. Harding is coming to supper
at the palace.”
“ O h?” said the doctor. “ Well,
perhaps she will take the medicine
at supper. Shall I send it by a
servant? She should take it with a
little piece of bread or with a glass
of water.”
“ Thank you. you needn’t trouble,”
said Mrs. Harding. “ I need no medicine.”
“ Come, Lynn.’* The Maharanee
could hardly wait while Lynn looked
for a wrap.
“ So long, Aunty. See you later.”
“ Does she never consult an astrologer?”
the Maharanee asked.
Lynn laughed: “ She did once—
and only once!”
“ But you? You believe in them ?”
“ I think the answer is no. I know
so little about them—practically
nothing. But aren’t they charlatans?
I ’ve aways been told that they are.”
“Oh, many of them are,” the Maharanee
admitted. “ There are charlatans
in all professions. W'e have a
very good court astrologer. I will
order him to cast your horoscope.
In fact, I have already consulted
him about it.”
“ W’hat fun! But please do keep it
secret from Aunty. She would
have conniption fits.**

Y OU m ay not remember ever
hearing the name of W illiam
Caxton, but it was his life which
makes your life today comfortable.
He it was who introduced printing
into England. This was in 1476. The
introduction of printing has made
all progress possible.
It wasn’t until 1638 that America
had a printing press, this at Harvard
university, but
after that printing
grew, and newspapers
sprang up, and
modern American
life began.
The printing press
is the forerunner of
knowledge wherever
it is introduced. The
printed word, even
to this day, has no
r i v a l . as a quick
means of disseminating
vital facts
and ideas.
The newspaper of today is one of
the modern wonders of the w’orld.
It is the broadest, quickest, most
flexible and most economical way of
getting a message into the minds
of the people.
Early in our national history,
manufacturers and merchants
sensed this power of the press. They
began using it to carry their advertising
facts and ideas into the
homes.
These early advertisers were
careful business men. The fact that
Charles Roth
the newspaper would complete the
educational process t r their good#
wasn’t enough. I t also had to do the
job at less cost than any other medium.
And they found, after m any trials
in different fields, that it did. It
got their message to prospective
buyers in a m an ne r which was econom
ical as well as effective.
Today this same condition is unchanged.
Advertisers, using newspapers
year in and year out, find it
the most profitable w ay in which to
tell their story to buyers.
The reason is simple. The newspaper
is the great common denominator
of modern life. It reaches
practically every fam ily. It has the
confidence of its readers. It stands
for everything which is right and
good and modern.
The advertisements in your newspaper
are as m uch a part of its vital
importance as the editorial and
the news columns.
As a m atter of fact, most readers
find it h ard to tell what interests
them most—the commercial news,
which is called advertising and
which touches their lives every day,
or the general news, in news story,
editorial and cartoon.
They’re both valuable.
This m an named Caxton was one
of the great benefactors of m a n kind.
He lighted the lam p—and it
is still burning bright, though centuries
have fled since he lived.

^ J O T everyone can be an individualist
and blaze his own trail
to fame. Some of us are better fitted
for falling into line as part of
an organization. Jam e s A. Farley’s
rise in politics is an example of
the rewards which may come to the
good lieutenant.
Farley was born in 1889 in Grassy
Point, N. Y .f a small village on the
Hudson river. There were five children,
and the father was a saloon
keeper. When J im Farley was ten
years old, his father died and his
mother started a combination saloon
and grocery store. The boy
often tended bar or worked as grocery
clerk on the other side of the
store. Through these jobs he
learned to meet the public, be
friendly with strangers and show
sympathy for their problems. He
attended the Stony Point high school
and the Packard commercial school
in New York. Graduating in 1906,
he was employed as a bookkeeper.
J im wras always interested in politics;
end, before he was old enough
to vote, he called house-to-house,
getting out the Democratic vote in
Stony Point.
His first political job was as town
clerk of Stony Point. He was courteous
to all, jolly, a hale-fellow-well*
met sort of man who had a pat on
the back for everyone. Through Al- j
fred E. Smith, whom he helped elect
governor of New York, and Franklin
D. Roosevelt, for whom he was
faithful lieutenant in the Presidenti
a l campaign, Farley forged steadily
ahead. He wfon the top political
plum in the United States, postmaster
general.
Even though he has few other
qualifications for success, there is a
lot of hope for the fellow who cooperates.

“ The Gray Fanged Terror”
He l l o e v e r y b o d y :
Dorothy Dublin of Brooklyn, N. Y ., wins the place of
honor today with the story of a terrible experience that once
happened to ht r dad. That makes her dad, Jacob Dublin, the
[ club’s newest Distinguished Adventurer.
It happened in Russia, in the town of Ubtchark, near the city
I of Minsk, close by what is now the Polish border, and it happened
forty-eight years ago, in the late fall of 1888, when Jacob
Dublin was just a little nine-year-old boy. If a grown man had
gone through the adventure that little Jake Dublin encountered
on a lonely country road that chilly fall evening in 1888, it would
still be a wow o f a story. But when an adventure of that sort
J happens to a nine-year-old kid—well—then you have a new definition
of the true meaning of the word “ terror.”
They had wolves in West Russia in those days. For that
matter, you’ll s till find wolves in certain parts of Russia
today. Then, there were plenty of them—and more than a
few lurked in the forests around Ubtchark. Those wolves gave little
Ja k e Dublin plenty to worry about, too. For it was his duty to drive
his father's horses to the feeding ground every day, and that feeding
ground was on thc edge of the forest.
Wolves Harmless During Morning Hours.
It wasn't driving the horses TO the pasture so much as driving them
home again in the evening that worried little Jake. In the mornings,
the wolves never bothered anyone. But in the evening, emboldened by
the darkness, they had been known to attack grown men. The result
was that little Jake had to be mighty sure to bring those horses back
from pasture while it was still light. And if it ever happened he was
delayed until dusk began to fall—well—then his dad took over the job
of bringing those horses home.
But one day things went wrong out at the pasture—and little Ja ke
Dublin almost didn't get back.
He started early enough. If he had come back as promptly
there wouldn't have been any danger. But trouble started
when he reached the feeding ground and tried to bring the horses
home. There was a beautiful filly in the herd, called Tara, which
was as yet unbroken. A couple of times before she had been
hard to manage, but this afternoon Jake couldn't do anything
with her. Fur almost an hour he chased her about the pasture
trying to get her under control.
It was almost dark by the time he got her quieted, and still he had
the other horses to round up. It took him another 10 or 15 minutes to

The futurist artist was visiting
the home of his only patron.
‘‘By the way,” said the patron,
‘‘did you hear about the burglary
that occurred here the other n ig h t?"
“ No,” said the artist. “ Did they
get away with m u c h ? ”
“ A few bits of jewelry,” said the
other. “ And you know that picture
I bought from you. They cut it out
of its fram e , and—”
The artist gave a cry of delight.
“ Good! My fortune’s m a d e ," he
said. "T his is just the sort of advertisement

“ A nd ," continued the patron lightly,
“ they took the fram e and left

The caller knocked ot the door.
“ Is Mr. Sm ith in ? ” he asked.
"Y e s , he is,” replied the lady of
the house.
^ “ That's fine,” said the visitor,
“ Maybe I can collect the money he

Mrs. Sm ith smiled scornfully.

Suddenly, a lithe, gray form shot out of the woods and sank its teeth
into the neck of the first horse!
get all the beasts tethered together, one behind the other, the way
his dad had taught him to bring them in, and by that time it was night.
Little Jake Has Choice of Two Paths.
The forest, to one side of him , was ominously still. D ark treetops
loomed over him, silent against an almost pitch black sky. Little Ja ke
knew it was no hour for a nine-year-old boy to be out alone. He knew
that the quicker he got home, the better. There were two paths he could
take on his way home. One path turned into a road that ran along the
edge of the forest. It was a roundabout way, but it was a little safer
than the other.
The other ran part way through the forest. It was more
dangerous than the first route, but it was shorter and it went
straight toward his home. Faced with a choice between these
two paths, little Jake chose the one that went through the forest.
O n either path there was danger from wolves. Jake picked the
shorter way because—well—he wanted to get home just as fast
as he could.
He started down the path leading his long string of horses. He
I had n't gone very far when suddenly Tara, who was the second horse in
the line, began to get unruly again. She bucked and reared. The rest
of the horses became nervous and fidgety. Wondering what was the
' matter with Tara now, Jake moved down thc line and tried to calm her.
But the horse wouldn't be calmed. Something was frightening her—
and frightening her mighty badly, too.
Little Jake wasn't long in finding out what was frightening
Tara. Suddenly, a lithe, gray form shot out of the brush alongside
of the path and sank its teeth into the neck of the first
horse! A wolf!
Forest Turns Into a Shrieking Bedlam.
Then, in an instant the stillness of the forest was rent by a
shrieking bedlam. The other horses screamed and struggled
while the first horse, blood gushing from his throat, was pulled
down bv the wolf. So far the wolf had paid no attention to little
Jake. He was too intent on making his kill. But now, other
wolves wrre coming, attracted by the noise and the scent of
blood. Jake could hear their weird howling coming nearer and
nearer. Uhen the rest of the pack arrived—well—then he'd be in
for it. Then there would he a general slaughter of his poor animals,
and he, too. would find how it felt to have a wolf's fangs
tearing at his throat.
He stood in the midst of his rearing, plunging horses, too stiff with
fright to move a step. What good would it do him to run anyway?
Those wolves rould pick up a scent and follow it faster than he could run.
And then little Jake saw it—a light. F ar down the path, half obscured
by trees, a torch was flaring. Then hc saw another—and another!
He could hear voices now—m en’s voices, shouting to him to stay where
he was Thc wolf heard those voices, too. He slunk off into the forest
and the howls of the advancing pack were stilled. In a few moments
a hand uf villagers came running up the trail. They had started combing
the forest when little Jake d idn’t get home by nightfall—and they
had arrived just in tim e to insure his getting home at all.

In Alaska the government pays a
bounty of $ 1 on all eagles that are
destroyed because they are said to
prey on salmon in large numbers.
Most of the states in the Union offer
the eagle no protection, and it may
be killed at any time, the same as
a hawk or owl, but none offers a
bounty. Michigan and a number of
other states have protected the
eagle as a non-game bird and it
cannot be shot at anytime. Pennsylvania
thinks so much of our national
bird that it has just set aside
an eagle sanctuary, on Mt. Johnson
island in the eastern part of the
state where the bird is protected.
There you have four different
opinions of the economic value of
the eagle, all from one country.
If the eagle is of sufficient value
and interest to be preserved and encouraged
to propagate in a minority
of our states: is considered a pest
in Alaska and a bird of little or no
account in most of the remaining
states, then just what is its real
status?
This is one of the many incidents
of little accord throughout the nation
on the economic status of many
birds.

X T EW Y O R K .—If this means “ the

N o t B e E n d e d the goose-step
B y a M a d m a n and h°Pe for
* s o m e future
Spartacus to lead us into a return
engagement. The phrase, “ the contemporaneousness
of the past,” is,
I believe, Dr. Charles Beard’s.
Along with Dr. Beard’s book, “ The
Rise of American Civilization,” it
has reminded this onlooker that no
m a dm a n ever has wrecked the
world and that the creative and hum
ane spirit has never failed. History
did not sustain Lord Grey when,
in 1914, he said, “ The lights of the
world have gone out, and I doubt if j
they ever will be lit in our lifetim e.” j
In the spirit of these mediations, j
this department will, in the forth- J
coming dark days, keep a sharp eye
out for lamplighters, men of creative ;
intelligence, and their names will be ;
carried on this mast-head whenever
possible.
F or a start, here’s Eduard
Benes, former president of
Czecho-Slovakia, an old story in
personality columns, but news
today as a wise, calm spirit in a
world of howling demagogues.
The belch of the suns in Poland
was answered almost to the m in ute
by his book, "D em ocracy
Today and Tomorrow.” Here is
what he says about “ the end of
civilization” :
“ We hear very often the slogan
that w ar or revolution in Europe will
m ean the end of hum an civilization.
That is a mistake. Modern civiliza-
. . tion cannot be
H u m a n S p ir it destroyed. One
W i l l C o n tin u e can destroy in
C r e a t i v e W o r k ° ne country,
through war or
revolution, some of the remarkable
monuments of hum an culture and
civilization, ancient and modern;
but the present organization of the
world does not allow anybody to destroy
hum an civilization. H um an
civilization is, first of all, the moral
conception of modern m ankind, although
including, of course, all econom
ic values, all achievements of
technological progress, all great
cultural monuments, buildings, cities,
universities, libraries, museums
of art and science; m any of them
are of inestimable value, and could,
of course, be destroyed in a great
catastrophe. And that w’ould be a
loss which could never be replaced.
B u t that does not m ean the destruction
of human civilization. The hum
a n spirit, in its great creative power,
having saved in innumerable
places the results of modern science,
technology and progress—m aterial
and m oral—will continue in any
case its great creative work.”
There is no bland optim ism in Mr.
Benes’ book. He invokes no easy
formulas and sees salvation only in
the collective work and intelligence
of men of good will—in desperate
endeavors, perhaps, but sure to win
in the end because they always
have.
At another moment of tension,
when the “ end of civilization”
seemed near, I remember talking to
the great Dr. Masaryk, Mr. Benes’
intellectual and political mentor. He
curtly refused to discuss the particularized
rights and aspirations of
Czecho-Slovakia.
“ We could state them only in
terms of world morality and justice,”
he said. “ If we are right
in thus conceiving our undertakings,
we may be assured that
they will prevail. If our hopes
are not so based, they should
not prevail.”
Without a hint of bitterness for
powers recreant to their obligations
to his country, or to its assailant,
M r. Benes puts his hope for freedom
_ and democrat

By RUTH A R N O L D N IC K E L
« • ! JUST ran in to tell you that I
1 won’t be at the meeting, tomorrow,”
said Mrs. Mitchell, as her
neighbor came out on the porch to
greet her. “ I ’m going to take L illian
to the m u seum .”
‘ ‘How nice,” commented Mrs.
Gracie, giving her a chair.
‘‘Well, it’s rather a hot trip ,” Mrs.
Mitchell admitted, ‘‘and L illian isn’t
very enthusiastic, but I think she
ought to take advantage of such
things. Besides, she never knows
what to do with herself during vacations.
I simply have to arrange a
program for her, or she would waste
her time or mope. How did you
manage to get Gladys interested in
so many worthwhile things?”
Mrs. Gracie smiled. “ Gladys? Oh,
she and I take turns in choosing
special undertakings now. I used to
insist that she work out certain projects.
When she was 12 years old—
that was two years ago—I decided
that the time had come to teach her
all sorts of things. She had learned
to sew a little and loved to make
doll’s clothes, but I wanted her to
m ake something useful. I bought
some fine white cloth and started
her on a slip.”
‘‘Gladys never wore the slip,” said
Mrs. Gracie ruefully, “ at least not
until I had made it over. She disliked
working on it. This started a
kind of struggle between us.”
“ But she sews now, doesn’t she?”
“ Yes, she sews beautifully,” said
Mrs. Gracie. ‘‘When the slip was
finally finished, I said nothing more
about sewing. I d id n ’t want to fix
the dislike that I had started. Then
the next summer she begged me for
a pink tennis dress. It was early in
the season and the ones she liked
were too expensive. Then she said,
‘Mother, I think I could make one, if
you’d help me with the binding
around the neck.’ I tried not to show
m y delight! We found a rem nant of
goods and she made the dress with
very little help from me; you see
I she wanted it. She read the direc-
I tions and made it carefully.”
“ But that implies that mothers
j shouldn’t try to direct their chil-
I dren,” objected Mrs. Mitchell.
Imposing Their Own Views.
“ I wondered about that,” said
Mrs. Gracie. ‘‘and I talked it over
with Tom. He had been trying to
improve her reading, but when he
brought books home from the library
she never seemed to care for
them. Then we concluded that we
weren’t accomplishing our purpose.
“ Maybe you are right,” said Mrs.
Mitchell. ‘‘Tell me what you d id .”
“ We decided to stop imposing our
tastes upon Gladys and let her develop
her own. We had kept her
too busy. As I thought about it, I
remembered my own early sum m er
vacations. I had regular work to do,
but I was allowed to create most of
m y own pleasures. I remembered
, long hours of reading—discovering
j books that I learned to love, hours
of play, and gardening in the back
yard. Whenever I got bored, I began
to look around for something
new and interesting to do.
“ I told this to Tom and he rem em bered
the same conditions with regard
to his own childhood. We decided
that we had been supervising
Gladys too much. So we planned
to be ready to share experiences
with her part of the time, but to
leave her m any hours each week
when she would be entirely free.
“ Gladys had to do some housework,
of course, and that kept her
busy in the mornings. During the
first week she seemed a little bored
in the afternoons. Then one day she
asked me to teach her to knit a
sweater! The next week she began
voluntarily looking for something to
read and before long she was interested
of her own accord in some of
the very subjects her father had
hoped she’d lik e !”
‘‘But wasn’t she ever idle?” asked
Mrs. Mitchell.
“ Yes, she used to lie in the h am mock
on the porch sometimes for
hours. One day she said to me,
‘Mother, I love to lie and look up
at the sky in the summertime. In
the winter I'm too busy to think and
get things straightened out in my
m in d .’ ”
“ G racio us!” said Mrs. Mitchell,
rising—‘‘I think I'll drop the museum
outing. Perhaps if I drag L illian
there on a hot day when she
doesn’t want to go. she will dislike
it.”
“ I ’m afraid Gladys would,”
laughed Mrs. Gracie sympathetically.
“ She often joins me in my enthusiasms
if I don’t try to force
them on her. But she’s an individual,
too, and I can’t expect her to
be exactly like me. We take many
| trips together and take turns decidi
ing where to go. A museum trip is
j always the result of an urge to see
some special thing. Both of us enjoy
it, but I am always careful to
bring Gladys home while she is still
interested, and before she gets
tired.”

Food* Men Like to Eat
What are the foods that Father
likes best—the fine, old-fashioned
dishes—tasty, full of flavor, and perfectly
cooked! He likes a meal to
be composed of only a few foods;
he wants to know what he is eating,
and he does not want foods swathed
in a blanket of whipped cream. In
a word, fancy cooking is apt to be
wasted on Father but he’ll appreciate
good cooking to the limit.
Left to his own devices, many a
m a n would choose a diet of meat,
potatoes, and pie. They’re not particularly
fond of vegetables—these
men of ours—and when it comes to
salads, it’s a sheer waste of energy
to serve them anything fancy. So
a little judicious
planning is necessary
on our part
in order to give
Father his favorite
foods and provide
a wholesome,
well-balanced
meal in the bargain.
Each of these recipes, tested in
my own kitchen, I'v e found to be
prime favorites with men. Well prepared
and attractively served,
they’ll go a long way toward establishing
your reputation as a good
cook.

Modern methods for the prevention
and control of live stock diseases
have been grouped under
three m ain headings by anim al
pathologists of the college of agriculture,
University of Illinois. One
method listed is the slaughter of
sick anim als and the thorough disinfection
of the premises. This
method has been employed successfully
in the eradication of foot and
mouth disease and of tuberculosis
in cattle.
Vaccination of susceptible animals
with suitable immunizing
agents is the second method listed
for the control afid prevention of
an im a l diseases. The object of such
practice is to raise the resistance
of susceptible animals to such a degree
that exposure to the disease
for which the vaccination is made
will have no efTect. Cholera in
swine, black leg in cattle, distemper
in dogs and sleeping sickness in
horses are diseases that are controlled
by vaccination. Im m unizing
horses against sleeping sickness is
one of the newer developments in
the field of vaccination and offers
considerable promise as a specific
preventive for this malady.
The third measure for the control
and prevention of live stock diseases
was listed as improved methods of
live stock management with various
state colleges of agriculture serving
as a constant source of information
on improved methods.
Such information is often of real
value since a change in feeding
practices or a change in management
with respect to care of both
young and mature stock may greatly
reduce the incidence of certain
diseases, it was explained. Pregnancy
disease of ewes and acetonemia
in cows are examples of diseases
that are now largely preventable
by the application of information
that has accumulated relative
to the nature of these disorders.
W’hen disease does appear in spite
of approved management practices,
live stock owners are advised to
seek the services of competent veterinarians
without delay.
I F YOU take a large size, then
* you’ll find 1806 one of the most
becoming dresses you ever put
on! The long, slim lines of the
paneled skirt make your hips look
much narrower, and the bodice
gathers give correct ease over the
bust. With its touch of lace, this
will be very sm art for bridge par-
ARTHENT
ties, luncheons and club affairs.
Make it of flat crepe, thin wool
and, later on, sheer velvet.
Coat Style Dress.
The “ something different” about
this practical dress is the way the
closing is cut sharply over at the
waistline. The design (1681) gives
you plenty of lap-over, so that you
needn’t sew buttons and make
buttonholes all the way down. And
of course you don’t need to be
told how easy the coat style is to
make, to get into, and to iron.
The Patterns.
No. 1806 is designed for sizes 36,
38, 40. 42, 44, 46, 48. 50 and 52.
Size 38 requires 4liz yards of 39-
inch material, with short sleeves;
47s yards with long sleeves; 1
yard for vestee.
No. 1681 is designed for sizes 34,
36, 38, 40, 42. 44, 46 and 48. Size
36 requires 4 3 4 yards of 35-inch
m ate rial without nap; % yard contrasting;
2 3 4 yards edging.

Some of the reason* why this
country has changed from a nation j
of farmers to a nation of city work- j
ers are given in the annual report 1
of the Administrator, Agricultural
Adjustment administration. The re- !
port points out that as late as 1870
more than half of the gainfully employed
persons in the United States
were in agriculture, but that by 1930 ,
the proportion had fallen to a little
over a fifth.
This change, says the report, was
due to a variety of causes, under- |
lying all of which have been advances
in technology and invention.
Such advances have almost invariably
displaced farm labor and created
industrial employment in the
cities. Other causes listed include
expansion of commercial and distributive
services, as manufacturing
and processing took precedence
over cultivation of crops.
The report calls attention to the
development of a division of labor
in which farmers concentrated on
raising foodstuffs and fibers while
the city workers took over many of
the other tasks formerly performed
on self-sufficient farms. Another
cause of the shift noted in the report
has been the increase in transportation,
communication, and governmental
services which have become
progressively more necessary with
the growth of cities.
ln the early days of the rail*
roads, travelers often aroused suspicion
and station agents frequently
asked them personal questions.
But the Liverpool  Manchester
railway went further. Up to 1837
this road made each passenger fill
out a ticket application that not
only asked his name, address and
the purpose of his trip, but also
his age, occupation and place of
birth.
In "The Westphalian Last Supper,”
a stained-glass window in
St. Mary’s cathedral in Soest,
Westphalia, Germany, Christ and
His disciples are depicted in their
customary places at the table, eating
Westphalian ham and pumpernickel
and drinking Westphalian
beer and kuemmel.
Scattered throughout England
are some 400 “ camping coaches,”
or remodeled railroad cars, in
which about 50.000 persons each
year spend their sum m er vacations.
The coaches, permanently
located on beautiful country sidings,
accommodate private parties
of from 4 to 10 and cost from
$10 to $25 a week, which includes
linen and tableware.
Soil erosion, now ravaging a
large part of the world on a scale
unparalleled in history, is believed
to have formed about a million
square miles of new desert in the
past 25 years.—Collier’s.

Rubber tires for farm equipment,
flrst introduced in 1932, have made
; a phenomenal increase in use.
Whereas there were rubber tires on
14 per cent of the tractors m anufactured
in 1935, it is estimated that
75 per cent of the tractors m an u factured
in 1939 will be equipped
with rubber tires. Rubber tires on
tractors have made from 20 to 25
per cent more horse power available
