Budget Rill Passe*
Governor H eil’s signature to the
budget bill this week w ill write into
law a state spending program of 67 Ms
million dollars for the next two years.
Final senate vote on concurrence of
the budget bill as passed by the assembly
was 24-8, with several o f the
Progressives voting for the bill a fter
futile attempts to amend it. Senator
Bernard Gettleman, Milwaukee Republican,
joined seven Progressives in vo ting
against the bill. Gettleman as
well as others who voted against the
bill fe lt that the budget failed to adequately
provide fo r old age pensioners
and educational needs. Progressives
who voted against final passage were
Senators Busby, Connors, Greenquist,
Hampel, Kresky, Nelson and Rush.
The appropriations are approximately
$900,000 higher than the amount
recommended by the governor in his
original budget message, but again
the allotments are 2 million dollars
less than the finance committee’s recommendation.
A last minute 5 per
cent cut in the form o f a substitute
bill at the Governor’s request accounted
for the change from the joint finance
committee recommendation.
During the current biennium ending
July 1, the Progressive administration
total was $70,738,989.69 which included
3->4 millions for relief. H eil’s budget
does not include any provisions fo r relief.
Appropriations fo r relief will be
handled in a separate bill.
As the week ended, Governor Heil
had not had time to sign the bill. I
However, his .signature was expected
in that he expressed satisfaction with
the budget and sent his personal congratulations
to Senator Otto Mueller
and Assemblyman M cIntyre, chairmen
o f the joint finance committee, for
their expeditious handling of the
measure through their respective
houses.
Student Spectators
University students lined the corridors
and balcony o f the senate chambers
Thursday night with the vain
hope that senators in considering the
budget bill would make concessions,
not granted by the assembly, in the
million dollar cut now certain fo r the
university.
Amendments to exempt the university
and teachers’ colleges from the 5
per cent general cut as included in the
substitute at the governor’s request
and tg appropriate an additional $250,-
000 to the emergency board earmarked
fo r higher educational functions were
defeated.
Once during the evening session the
students cheered a Progressive senator
who pleaded in their behalf. Warned
by Lieutenant Governor Goodland
that he would not tolerate any displays
o f enthusiasm or disapproval, the
students remained orderly and quiet
throughout the 3 hour session.
Only cheering note fo r the students
and President Dykstra, also in the
audience, came fyom Senator Otto
Mueller, Wausau, chairman of the
finance committee and member o f the
emergency board, who promised that
as long as he was a member of the
emergency board, education would not
suffer in Wisconsin.
Senator Risser, Madison Progres
sive, chief spokesman for the university,
warned senators that Wisconsin
could not uphold its present high rank
as an outstanding school with an appropriation
fitted fo r an enrollment of
8,000 students, when the university
now has 12,000. He was reminded by
Senator Bolens, Port Washington
Democrat, that the present university
head, Clarence A. Dykstra, came to
Wisconsin from Cincinnati with a
great reputation as an economy administrator,
and that it was hoped he
would effect similar economies in his
present position.
Teachers’ Problems
State school teachers and their representatives
were busy last week defending
their interests as they appeared
before senate committees to protest
repeal o f the 1937 teachers tenure law
and a bill abolishing the teachers’ retirement
surtax.
The bill abolishing the 1937 act
which gives permanent tenure to teachers
who have served five years or
more in one school has already passed
the assembly, and will be before the
senate a fter it is reported out by the
senate committee on education and
public welfare.
Appearing against the bill were
teaehers* association representatives,
who asserted the law only gave to
teachers the same rights in effect that
civil service gives to state and federal
employes. For the bill were school
boards and members of the legislature,

POLITICS:
Early Rumblings
F rom coast to coast extend the
great rural regions whose political
power has been recognized too late
by many an office seeker. M ore vocal,
m ore government-minded than
their apathetic city cousins, A m e ric
a ’s sm all towns and farm s w rite
three-fourths of all letters to congressmen.
They vent an opinion
readily on such m atters as those
destined to determ ine 1940’s ele ction,
nam ely: (1 ) foreign policy, and
(2) agriculture, as related to the U.
S. economic, labor and relief problems.
In 1938 serious Dem ocratic rev
e rs e s in fa rm states gave rise to a
Republican hope: Th at the nation's
m idland vote pool w ill go G. O. P . in
1940. A Gallup poll recently confirm
ed it, givin g D em ocratic hopefuls
the jitters and forcing prem ature
rum blings of next y e a r’s cam paign.
Nobody yet knows whether
President Roosevelt w ill run again
(31 per cent o f U. S. voters would
approve it) but this month three
C A N D ID A T E F A R L E Y
Just looking around.
D em ocratic nomination cam paigns
are taking shape despite w ise counsel
that the adm inistration had better
settle im m ediately on a man
who can be elected, rather than
think only o f the nominating convention.
The cam paigns:
F arley. A t M exico, Mo., A m e ric
a ’s sm artest politician told a group
o f m ilita ry students that “ we are
one of the few nations where a
m an’s destiny is in his own hands.” |
Postm aster G eneral Jam es A. F a rley
's destiny probably lay in the trip
he was then taking, a gun-jumping, ;
cross-continent tour in which he
placed some 200 delegates under
lock and key for him self or the man j
he chooses to run for President, j
Carefully avoided was any statement j
that m ight offend either M r. Roose- j
v e lt or V ice President Garner, but !
Jim F arley was sizing up matters
as a good politician should. A R oman
Catholic probably could not be i
elected President, but Mr. F a rle y ’ s
200 votes m ight easily m ake him '
v ic e presidential nominee.
Garner. N ev er has a southerner
been elected President, the m ore so |
today because N egro voters almost
furnish a balance of pow er in sev- j
era l northern states. But John
N ance G arn er's cam paign m anager |
has concentrated in south and south- 1
w est states to line up 200 delegates I
for the aging Texan whose intense
popularity is the y e a r ’s No. 1 political
phenomenon. I f a secret agreem
ent exists between Dem ocrats
F a rle y and G arner, the tactics thus
fa r bear it out. Each has studiously
avoided an invasion o f the other’s
stamping grounds, and though neither
has spoken there is ev ery indication
that they see eye-to-eye. Both
advocate econom izing, and both
looked with alarm on the Presiden t’s
“ purge” last fall. Since a northern
Catholic cannot hope to ca rry the
South, and since a southerner might
have trouble in the North, nothing
could be m ore logical than a union
o f G arner and F a rle y forces.
M cNutt. In 1940 a m illion colleg
e students w ill cast their first
votes, and newly organized Student
Opinion Surveys finds their choice
(17.7 per cent) is Indiana’s ex-Gov.
Pau l V. McNutt, now high com m issioner
to the Philippines. M eanwhile,
from Indianapolis, M anager
Frank M cH ale is busy broadcasting
that Mr. M cNutt is the only Dem ocra
t who can ca rry Indiana and is
therefore a powerhouse throughout
the northern states. H urrying back
hom e from his P acific post, handsome
Mr. McNutt is the first D em ocra
t to actually open his 1940 cam paign.
Significantly, how ever, he has
taken no cracks at Messrs Roosevelt,
F a rle y or G a rn er; a vice presidency
(w hich is the most likely
berth fo r him ) is no longer to be
sneezed at after what is happening
to Cactus Jack Garner.
BUSINESS:
D istribution
In 1870 about 75 per cent o f U. S.
w orkers w ere producing goods, the
other 25 per cent distributing them.
By 1930, reports the Twentieth Century
Fund, production efficiency had
increased so much that only 50 per
cent of U. S. w orkers w ere needed
fo r this phase. M eanwhile distribution
had absorbed the other 25 per
cent, accounting for half the jobs.
A possible conclusion: Distribution
m ay be costing too much. A possible
rebuttal: Men must eat, and
m en kicked out o f production by labor-
saving m achinery must turn to
distribution jobs or starve. Though
this raises per item cost to the consumer,
ev ery man benefits by a
higher livin g standard.
Breaking down a sam ple y e a r’s
total sales volume, Tw entieth Century
Fund found 1929's finished
goods cost $66,000,000,000. O f this,
$39,000,000,000 (o r 59 cents on the
d o lla r) went to distribution. This
meant that production, which em ploys
half the man power, gets less
than half the revenue. O f the total
1929 distribution cost, $13,000,000,000
went to retail distribution, $7,000,-
000,000 to wholesalers, $9,000,000,000
to transportation, another $9,000,-
000,000 to m ailU facturers’ distribution
costs.
Sm allest item of all was a d vertising,
which (co n tra ry to popular
misconception) cost less than
$1,000,000,000 and probably paid its
w ay by givin g consumers a better
buy for their money.

and G erm any's demands against
Poland for Danzig and a slice of the

to conciliation in place o f w ar

but they probably forgot that Signor
Mussolini’s speech fitted p erfectly
into a chain of events which matches
with the pattern created last autumn
at Munich.
At that tim e it w as Mussolini who
“ counseled” Der Fuehrer to talk

her M editerranean argum ent
with Italy is one o f the “ knots.”
w ill probably untie it an,.* persuade
Britain to appease once m ore by

T
o d a y’s most likely solution of the
Danzig problem is a plebiscite with
League of Nations sanction, in which
Dan/.ig’s 96 per cent G erm an population
w ill m ake quick work of an international
crisis.
TAXATION:
Rehash
No. 1 surprise of this season*!
econom y minded congress is that
the senate should vote $1,218,666,000
(or farm purposes. T o the W hit*
House—not economy m inded—thi*
was also a surprise, io much that
adm inistration pressure w ill probably
m ake congress "b u y ” its farm
appropriation by aitting all sum m er
to figure out new taxes. Reason:
The President ch arges congress
broke its prom ise not to vo te any
special appropriations without providing
new taxes to m eet the cost.
Last y ea r's parity paym ents of $212,-
000,000 (com pared with the senate’s
current $225,000,000) w ere voted under
sim ilar circum stances and left
a big hole in Mr. R oosevelt’s budget.
Capitol H ill’s two m a jo r tax figures
are Mississippi’s Sen. Pat H arrison,
chairm an o f the upper house
finance com m ittee, and N orth C arolina's
Rep. Robert Doughton, whose
w ays and means com m ittee must
originate all tax legislation. Genera
lly speaking they a gre e with the
President on one fundam ental: That
levies on low incomes shall not be
raised. Th ey therefore agree also
that any tax revision this session
must be m erely a rehash o f present
upper-bracket levies. Less mutual I
is another White House principle, [
that governm ent incom e must not
be lowered. But congress, having
invited deficit with its fa rm bill, has
little choice. Revenue can hardly
be low ered now.
With severa l w eeks’ debate still J
ahead if tax revision com es this session
(it should, because corporate j
taxes yielding $1,300,000,000 expire !
next D ecem ber) some solution like [
this is possible: Abandonment o f the
undistributed profits tax and retention
of capital stock and excess prof- |
its levies; creation o f a flat 18 per
cent corporate levy instead o f one
varyin g, as at present, from 1 6 'i to
19 per cent; low er rates fo r corporations
m aking $25,000 or less. P ro ponents
expect the rehash would
touch business for $2,000,000 a y ea r
m ore than at present— not much in
actual cost but a lot in principle
when next y e a r ’s election is considered.
N AV Y :
Beef Slew
Fresh A rgentin e beef is barred
from the U. S. by sanitary regu lations,
which is one m ajo r reason
why A rgentina disrupted the Pan
Am erican conference at L im a last
Decem ber. But canned beef ( “ w illy
” ) is not barred. President Rooseve
lt m ade news recently by asking
congress to perm it the navy to buy
its canned beef from A rgentin a at
15 cents a pound, 8 cents less than
Am erican beef. M oreover, he said,
the A rgentin e product is better.
A t Buenos Aires, A rgentin e F o reign
M in ister Jose Cantilo thought
Mr. R oosevelt’s taste fo r South
A m erican beef w as “ a fine gesture
which m ay becom e an im portant
precedent in friendly relations between
the two countries.” But at
Washington a congress trem endously
conscious o f the fa rm vote thought
otherw ise. D iscovering a cause
celebre, Illinois Rep. L e o Allen
raised visions o f congressm en
sm acking their lips over a beef-tasting
contest. Said he: “ M any o f us
b elieve A m erican beef has no superior.
F o r that reason I am o ffe ring
a resolution for a com m ittee of
five to investigate and determ in e
w hether Argentine beef is b etter.”

NATIONAL
AFFAIRS
Rtvitw td by
C A R T E R F IE L D
New Dealers disappointed
in Representative Smith’s debating
abilities . . . Democratic
politicians erred in appraising
Taft as weak speaker
. . . Hurried recalculations
in order for R e p u b lican
leaders.
W A S H IN G T O N .—N ew D ealers are
trem endously disappointed in the
popular reaction to the debates betw
een Senator R obert A. T a ft and
R ep resen ta tive T . V. Smith o f I llinois,
as shown by recent polls. In
the first place Smith is a prim e fa vo
rite with the N ew Deal. It w as
com m on gossip that the N ew D ea lers
wanted G overnor H en ry Horner
o f Illin ois to appoint M r. Smith to
the senate va ca n cy caused by the
death o f J. H am ilton Lew is, though
the governor did n 't oblige.
W hereas Senator T a ft is sim ply
anathem a to the N ew Deal. H e is
stoutly expressing view s which
seem to the adm inistration a turning
back to the Grand Old P a rty
in the days o f Boise Penrose and
R eed Sm oot.
But there is another angle. A fte r
the Gridiron dinner, follow ed by the
ed itors’ convention here, m ost observers
in Washington had virtu ally
w iped Senator T a ft off the slate of
Republican possibilities for the presidential
nomination next year.
R O B E R T A . T A F T
Th is was manna from heaven for
the N ew Dealers. Th ey do not want
the Republican candidate to be hitting
from the shoulder next year.
T h ey want a Republican nominee
w ho w ill be a pussyfooter on most
o f the “ reform s,” one who w ill g iv e
a grea t deal o f cred it for accom-
; plishm ents to the R oosevelt administration,
and thus narrow the area
| o f the cam paign debate to a ve ry
: narrow field.
In appraising T a ft as a w eak
j speaker, how ever, they are now
afraid they w ere counting their
chickens prem aturely. T a ft is certainly
not in D ew ey 's class as a
speaker, but apparently he puts his
points over on the radio. Worse,
from the N ew D eal standpoint, he
w ins a 66 to 34 per cent division of
listeners polled on his long series of
debates with R epresen tative Smith.
B elieved T a ft Too R eactionary.
Th is has caused som e hurried recalculations
on the part o f Republican
leaders too. M any of them
had been saying, especially a fter
the T a ft fiasco— as m ost o f them regard
ed it, in his speeches before the
G ridiron diners and before the editors—
that T a ft w as too much o f a
rea ction a ry—that he opposed too
m an y of the things the N ew Deal
had done— that the people would
n ever follow him.
To appreciate this, it must be rem
em bered that the Republican
lea der o f the senate is Charles L.
M c N a ry of O regon. N ow M c N a ry is
one of the shrewdest politicians in
the business, but he certainly has
never been num bered am ong the
devastating critics of the N ew Deal.
In his own political ca reer M cN ary
has been so successful, as contrasted
with such a hard hitter as L. J.
Dickinson, o f Iow a, for exam ple,
that there is quite a cult among the
! Republicans in fa vo r of pussyfooti
ing.
Hence the im portance of this surprising
showing that T a ft has m ade
as a result of his debates with
Smith.
New Deal Earns Thanks
Of Canned Milk Industry
In almost ev ery city and town of
the country, statistics show, the
amount of canned m ilk has increased
by leaps and bounds in the
last few years, w hile the sales of
fresh m ilk have declined. M ore and
, m ore fam ilies are finding that their
household budgets a re balanced
m ore easily by using canned m ilk
instead o f paying present prices for
| fresh milk.
I Without in the slightest d egree intending
any such thing, the New-
Deal in general, and the m ilk agree-
■ ments in particular, have earned the
{ gratitude o f the canned m ilk indusj
try b y so increasing thc spread in
| cost b etw een fr e s h m ilk and canned
I milR that they have overcom e the
p referen ce for fresh m ilk in hundreds
o f thousands o f homes.
Back in the ea rly days o f the
fum bling attem pts o f A A A to regu late
the m ilk industry, a substantia
l start tow ard this consum m ation—
although it w as n ever an obje
c tiv e— w as mde. A t that tim e
the T rip le A frow ned on chain stores
cutting prices on m ilk and cream .
Th e T rip le A didn't like anything
about the system which m ad e this
cutting possible.
When T rip le A clam ped down on
the N ew England chain stores for
cutting cream prices, the sales went
down in term s o f thousands o f g a llons.
Which resulted, o f course, in
the co-operatives having to m ake a
g rea t deal m ore butter, w hich, in
turn, com plicated the butter surplus
problem . Mind you. the chain
stores w ere com m anded to charge
higher prices for this c re a m — to
m ake b igger profits on the amount
handled than they wanted to.
Tu rnover Profits.
Th is is not a defense o f the m orals
o f the chain store operators. No
one thought anything else than that
the operators thought they would
m ake m ore money by selling a lot
o f cream at a sm aller profit. And
they w ere right. Presu m a bly the
A A A execu tives thought that if the
chain stores stopped cutting cream
prices, the concerns d eliverin g fresh
m ilk and cream would get m ore
business. M aybe the T rip le A e x ecutives
even thought eventu ally
they could reduce cream p rices to
everybod y.
But that w as not w hat happened.
When the price was put up in the
chain stores, people stopped buying
so much. In fact chain store sales
o f cream approached the vanishing
point, w hile sales o f cream by thc
d e liv e ry com panies rem ained pre- |
cisely as they w ere.
Th ere was no attack on the deliv
e r y price o f cream as being unreasonable.
T h e profit w as not e x orbitant.
But the chain stores w ere
able to sell m ore cheaply because
they had no d e liv e ry expense, and
no loss on bad debts.
R esu lt: P o o rer people, to whom
a fe w cents on a bottle o f c re a m is
im portant, turned to canned m ilk,
not because they w anted to, but because
it was that or no cre am at
all.
Tat Changes Await
End of Waiting Game
T a x changes to aid business r e co
very are long on lip se rvice and j
short on action, with P residen t
Roosevelt, the treasury and congress

Congress is w illin g to act, but is
not w illin g to stick its neck out.
T h e treasury is ea g er to act but its j
first rea l m ove tow ard action— an j
inspired story g iven to the Associat- ]
ed P ress outlining four im portan t I
proposals— is prom ptly brushed I
aside by the President as referrin g
to m ere “ estim ates” supplied on request
from congressm en. The
President sticks to his announced
plan: Congress can do anything it
wants to do to encou rage business in
the w a y o f tax revision but the estim
ated cash returns to the treasury
from business must not be reduced.
T h e President leaves it to congress
to take the in itiative but
doesn’t like any setup for tax r e v ision
that he has seen.
Th e treasury knows just w hat it
wants and finds itself in rather surprising
agreem ent with the conserva
tive D em ocrats on Capitol H ill,
headed by P a t H arrison, chairm an
o f the senate finance com m ittee, and
R obert L. Doughton. chairm an of
the house w ays and m eans com m
ittee. Most im portant o f the
treasu ry’ s proposals are:
Elim ination o f present undistributed
profits, capital stock and e x cess
profits taxes. Substitution o f
a flat rate corporation incom e levy
o f not m ore than 22 per cent, with
special treatm ent for incom es under
$25,000.
H igher-B racket T a x Redaction.
Reduction in higher-bracket personal
incom e taxes from a m a x imum
of 75 per cent to a m axim um
of 60 per cent. (A ctu a lly, treasury
experts have believed for se ve ra l
adm inistrations that 50 per cent provides
the m axim um revenu e.)
A uthorization fo r corporations to
ca rry o v e r tax credits for losses
fo r three yea rs instead o f one.
Modification of the capital gains
tax to encourage investm ent.
Under S ecretary John W. Hanes,
leading agitator for tax revision as
a business aid, now
has 100 item s in his
“ little black book,”
from which he
quotes fre ely to leg islators
and officials.
But nothing the
treasury says or
thinks is “ o fficia l”
until the President
approves. I f the
house w ays and
m eans com m ittee

just w hat he thinks. I f it summoned

House.
M eanw hile plenty o f con servative
D em ocrats on Capitol H ill a re taking
p rivate satisfaction in evidence
that the President w ill not support
action. Th e result, they think, w ill
be the nomination of a con servative
by the D em ocratic convention next
year. By the sam e token R epublican
leaders on Capitol H ill are placj

the D em ocrats, figuring that if no

O bjects at rest have Inertia; they
are hard to m ove. But objects in
m otion m ay by the least fo rce be
diverted, and their w hole future
course thus changed. It ia so with
liv e s ; for life is motion, and this is
particu larly true in youth. A young
m an ’s most casual encounter m ay
m od ify his whole life th ereafter, in
splendid or in dreadful ways.
It was M abel G a ye who perform ed
this function for Clint Jervies. M abel
was of no least im portance in
C lin t’s eyes. He had never m et her
till Enid Mason’ s dance at the Somerset,
and he saw with some distaste
upon their first encounter that
M abel had had a little too much to
drink. But the youngster who was
her escort for the evening w as in
w orse case than she, and in no condition
to d riv e a c a r; so a little befo
re m idnight Clint, who had on this
occasion no fem inine responsibilities
o f his own, volunteered to take Mabel
safely home, and had Enid •
thanks for that consideration.
When he and.M abel em e rg e d frorn
the hotel, it w as raining, gusty
squalls with an occasional roll of
thunder; and M abel lived • dozen
or fifteen m iles out o f Boston along
the Provid en ce road, so that the
d r iv e was a long one. A s soon as
they w ere in the car, she went to
sleep and stayed asleep till Clint
roused her to d irect him through the
last stages o f the journey. When
they reached her door, she urged
him to com e in, and when he declin
ed this invitation, she insisted
on being kissed good night.
Clint thus fa r obliged h er; but he
said at once a fterw a rd : “ I ’ ll have
to run along now. T h ere's some
construction on the road. I had to
detour, com in g out. It w ill taka me
an hour to get back to tow n ."
“ Oh, you don’ t have to- hurry,”
she pleaded. "Y o u can dodge all
that by going o v er Kenesaw H ill.”
And to his questions, she gave
him directions how to find this byw
ay. A t a certain traffic-light he
must turn to the right . . . H e nodded
his understanding, but goodhum
oredly insisted on departing.
She stood in the open doorw ay still
pleading, w hile he got into the car
at the foot o f the steps; but when
she saw that he was bound to go,
she called so ftly:
“ W ell, good night! And thanks a
lot! You w ere a peach to bring me
home. Telephone m e tom orrow .”
“ Sure w ill," Clint prom ised. “ I ’ll
be seeing you.”
H e was p erfectly sin cere in this
prom ise; but as a m atter o f fact
it was m ore than two yea rs before
he saw her again, and he had by
that tim e com p letely forgotten their
fo rm e r encounter. Vet if he had
not taken M abel home, and returned
to town by w ay of K enesaw Hill,
there is no reason to think he would
e v e r have seen June Lea ford , and
K itty L e a fo rd ’s death must have
gone unrem arked, and those three
shuttered houses on the H ill m ight
w ell ■ have hid their dark secret
to the end . . .
Clint left M abel G aye standing in
her own door and drove away. He
chuckled and rubbed his lips with
the back of his hand w here she
had kissed him ; and he thought soberly
that someone ought to tell her
a fe w things, and w as amused at
his own puritanic mind. He had not
a lw ays been so austere, and he forgot
M abel now to think about himself,
as a young man is apt to do.
B efore C lint’ s father died, the olde
r man must have suspected that
C lint and his sister C lara w ere not
ready for self-m anagem ent; for he
created the J ervies Tru st; and Miss
Moss, an angular m iddle-aged w om an
with a surprising tenderness beneath
her iron ex terior, who had
been M r. J erv ies’ secreta ry, beca
m e the actual if not the titular
head of that Trust. She had been
alm ost like a foster-m other to these
children since their own mother
died, and continued in that role.
Clint, reflecting tonight in a mild
am usem ent on his own virtuous disapproval
o f M abel G aye, thought
M iss Moss would likew ise be
amused at his attitude. She had
used to be so deeply distressed by
C lin t’s own recklessness, and
C la ra 's too.
But that was better than a year
ago, and tim es w ere changed. Clint
him self now adm inistered the Jerv
ie s Trust, and shrewdly too; he
w as becom e a soher-minded young
man of affairs. He thought tonight
that sobriety and virtue might
som etim es mean a certain loneliness.
When she could trust Clint to
stand on his own feet, Miss Moss
had m arried Inspector T o p e; and
C lara, long before that, w as m arried
to young M at Hew s, whose new
play would open in Chicago in a day
o r two.
Considering these things tonight,
C lint decided it must be fun to be
m arried , if you found the right girl.
Th en he cam e to the traffic light
M abel G a ye had described to him,
and turned off the main highw ay, up
K enesaw Hill.
It was near one o'clock in the
m orning; and the shower was on in
(u ll force— a drenching rain, flare*
o f lightning. H e passed fo r a w hile
no residences at a ll; but as he
crossed the flat top of Kenesaw H ill
he saw, dim ly through the rain,
some houses set absurdly close together,
to one side o f the road. Clint
thought it was as though they huddled
near one another in this solitude
for the sake o f company. The
front door o f the m iddle one of these
houses w as open, with a light burning
in the hall, and he decided that
the door had blown open, that som eone
would presently com e down and
shut it. Then the houses fe ll behind
him as he drove on.
In the illumination o f an especially
bright flash o f lightning, he had
an im pression o f something white,
m ovin g, beside the road ahead of
“ N o, no,” she stam m ered. Sbe
was breathless, panting.
him , and just beyond the range of
his headlights. Y ou often saw cre a tures
along the road at night, saw
them usually as tw o red spots that
w ere eyes, saw them later as dark
shadows w here a cat or a dog squatted
to w atch you pass.
But this thing was not tw o red
spots; it was a white bulk. His
headlights caught it now. M ovin g—
yes, running.
H e leaned fo rw a rd m ore intently.
Th is was a person, running ahead of
him along the road. It was a w om an,
running ahead of him through
the rain. Th ere was a curious
shapelessness about her; and he
recognized the reason for this: her
dark hair was stream ing o ver her
shoulders, so that she seem ed to
have no head. H er feet, he thought,
w ere bare. A woman in a nightgown.
H e was within fifty yards of her
now, overtakin g her. Th e nightgown,
he saw, w as not of silk or
satin or any soft m ateria l; it appeared
to be a sober garm ent, entire
ly lacking in friv o lity ; yet it
was indubitably a nightgown, and
by the sam e token there could be
no doubt that it w as the only g a rm
ent this w om an wore.
Clint was drivin g slowly, and the
wom an ran sw iftly, so that she kept
for an instant this distance ahead
o f him. Then, like a wild anim al
which p erceives the hopelessness of
straightaw ay flight, she suddenly
turned aside oft the road, and she
tripped and fell headlong, and
swung around in one sw ift motion
and cam e to her feet agam. Like
a creature at bay she faced him , her
back set against the trunk of a
grea t tree.
He would rem em b er the picture
she m ade. He saw her face, a
white oval fram ed in the dark shadows
of her hair. One strand o f hair
was plastered across ber brow and
cheek by the rain, like a black
band across her countenance. She
brushed this desperately aside.
Th at nightgown, for all its severe
sim plicity, was pressed close to her
body by the w ind; it w as glued to
her by the rain. C lint saw that this
was, incredibly, a g irl, not a wom an
at all. A rather tall girl, slender
without being thin. She had run
gracefu lly, he rem em b ered that.
His heart w as pounding, shaking
him. H e pulled up the ca r and
opened the door on the side toward
her.
"W h a t’s the m a tte r ? " he asked.
He spoke carefu lly, in a gentle tone,
so that he m ight not frighten her
further. "W h a t’s the m atter? Any-
(hing I can d o ? "
"N o , no,” she stam m ered. She
was breathless, panting.
“ I can g ive you a lift,” he urged.
“ This is no night— ”
She appeared to change her mind.
She cam e toward him , and he
swung the door w ide. " Y e s , take
m e o n ," she bade him. "S tra igh t
on.” And she clim bed into the car
and sat down beside him in the w ide
seat here.
She was, o f course, drenched.
“ Pu t on m y co at,” he urged, and
started to strip it off.
"N o , no,” she repeated. “ I t ’ a not
fa r ." And she u rged: " G o on. Quickly,
p le a s e!”
He set the ca r in m otion; and he
looked at her sidew ise in an incredulous
and delighted wonder.
H er hair, heavy with w ater, lay
across her shoulders in dark ribbons;
her single garm en t was so
much a part o f her that she seem ed
like w et m arble. H e thought of
sculptured nymphs under a fountain’s
arching screen. In one sw ift
glance he saw her entire, and unforgetably.
She did not return his glan ce;
but neither did she seek to cover
herself from his eyes. Her own
w ere fixed straight ahead; yet by
something in her v e ry posture, in
the rigidity which she maintained,
he knew she w as conscious o f his
scrutiny, fighting to ignore it,
choked and stifled by her own sudden
realization of how she must appear
to him.
Clint, in a sw ift sym pathy and
tenderness, switched off the dashlight,
so that she sat in a cloaking
darkness. H e kept his eyes thereafter
upon the road and did not look
at her again. So presently he felt
her rela x a little, beside him ; and
he w as conscious that she studied
him fo r a long moment, with a
deep attention.
Suddenly she said: “ Thank y o u !"
“ N o trouble,” Clint assured her.
“ I ’ ll take you anywhere— ”
“ I didn't mean that," she said
honestly. "B u t— it’ s not fa r.”
H e felt, rather than saw, that she
was breathing with long careful inhalations.
as though she had to be
on guard lest she shudder or sob.
H e asked slow ly:
"Som ething— frighten you? Can’t
I h elp ?"
“ No, no, no,” she told him, her
vo ice trem bling. " I ’m not afraid.
I ’m n ot." She whispered with a sudden
passion: " I ’m not! I won’ t be
a fr a id ! "
Y e t he saw that she w as desperate
with terror.
“ Listen ,” he urged. “ I don’ t want
to butt in. But—don't you need
someone to stand by?”
" I 'm all r ig h t," she insisted.
H e nodded; but he said gen tly;
" I ’ m Clint Jervies. I ’m — respectable.
I f you ev e r want help. I'd
like to— ”
She said: " L e t m e out, please.”
Clint protested: " I don’t mean to
bother you. Y ou needn’ t run away
from m e ."
"T h is is w here I want to go.” she
insisted. “ Quick. Stop.”
Clint obeyed her. Th e ca r had
scarce ceased m oving before she
slipped to the (round. She closed
the door behind her. She ca lled :
“ Thank y o u ." Then she was gone,
vanishing into the wood beside the
road.
He hesitated, all reluctance. The
rain still pelted; lightning flickered
rem otely, or crashed close at hand.
H e saw something like a path where
she had disappeared.
But she was gone, and Clint ruefully
drove on. He passed a crossroa
d; and presently the w ay he follow
ed joined the main thoroughfare
into Boston.
B efore he cam e home he had decided
what to do. Inspector Tope
had proved long ago his capacity for
finding an answer to the most obscure
conundrums; the old man
m ight be able to read the answer
to this riddle of a lovely girl, scantily
clad, running so desperately
along a lonely country road in the
night and in the rain.
It was too late to seek out the Inspector
and Miss Moss tonight; but
tom orrow , Clint decided, he would
go to them with this fantastic tale.

Immortalized by a Dam

o f an adventurous explorer nh o
was both a great success and a
great failure. In 1832 French-born
Capt. Benjam in Bonneville of the
United States arm y obtained a lea ve
of absence to engage in a fur trading
expedition on condition that he e x plore
the trans-Missouri West and
I obtain information concerning the
I Indians, the topography o f the coun-
| try and its economic possibilities,
j T w o years later he set out at the
j head of a party of 110 men.
C om m ercia lly his venture was a
com plete failure. He built forts in
such poor locations that the frontiersm
en called them “ Fort Nonsense.”
Som e w ere so high in the
mountains that they w ere cut off
from the outside by the first snows
of winter. But his expedition was
successful in that he explored the
route through South Pass for wagon
trains and mapped the passage o f
the Columbia river through the Cascade
mountains. M oreover he was
an able m ilitary leader for he did i
not lose a single man during all
his perilous journey through the Indian-
infested wilderness.
A fter his return to the East he

o f John Jacob Astor and the result
was the book “ The Adventures of
Captain B onneville” by that famous
w riter. T h e book was a “ best selle
r ” o f its tim e but it did not help
Bonneville’s reputation greatly. He
had long overstayed his leave of
absence and when President Jackson
reinstated him as a captain in
1836 many people protested that
Bonneville should have been dismissed
from the service instead.
B onneville proved them wrong by
his conduct during the M exican war.
which won for him a citation for
gallantry in action. In 1852 he becam
e comm andant at F ort Vancouver
which stood 30 m iles down the

his name. He was brevetted a brigadier
general in 1869 and died in St.

‘A Message to Garcia’
U T in California lives an 82-
year-old retired arm y officer
whose nam e was once on e v e ry j
A m erica n ’s lips. He is Col. Andrew ;
Sum mers Rowan, the man who car- j
rieil “ a m essage to G a rc ia .”
In 1898 w ar with Spain was im- |
minent and President M cKinley
wanted to know if General G a rcia, j
com m ander of the Cuban insur- 1
gents, would co-operate with the j
Am erican forces if an arm y was |
sent there. The man chosen to find
out was young Lieutenant Rowan.
Rowan proved that the confidence ;
of his superiors was not m isplaced.
Making his way through the steam ing,
insect-infested jungle, drinking
germ -filled w ater, livin g on such
food as he could find and in constant
danger o f capture and execution by
the Spaniards as a spy, Rowan
found G arcia, got the information
he sought and safely m ade an equally
perilous return trip.
Rowan was taken to the White
House w here he received the thanks
of the President and promoted to
the rank o f lieutenant-colonel o f vo lunteers.
But the thing which m ade
him fam ous was an editorial, w ritten
by E lb ert Hubbard, for his m agazine,
the Philistine, the following
year. This editorial, published under
the title of “ A M essage to G a rc ia ,”
was translated into 20 languages,
reprinted all o ver |^e world and is
one of the best known pieces o f E n glish
prose ev er written.
As for the man who inspired it,
not until 1922 did he receive public
recognition from his country in the
form of the Distinguished S ervice
Cross for carryin g the “ m essage to
G a rc ia .”

A little girl had been to church |
for the first time. When she re- !
turned home her mother asked her j
what she thought of church.
“ I like it very much,” she said,
“ but there was one thing I didn’t
think was fa ir.”
“ What was that, dear?” asked her
mother.
“ Why, one man did all the work |
and then another man cam e around
and got all the money.”

Death Valley Samaritan
LOU W E S TC O TT B E C K went into
Death V alley to seek wealth but
alm ost perished. He stayed there
to devote his life to savin g others.
Death V alley of the days before
good roads and tourist facilities was
w ell named. Hundreds of Am erican
adventurers never returned from it.
A barren waste with trails that led
nowhere, and alive only with cra w ling
lizards and darting poisonous
snakes. Death V alley was a treacherous
trap baited to lure adventurers
with prom ises of gold.
Beck becam e known as the "G ood
Sam aritan of Death V a lley ,” piling
up rocks and putting signs on them
directing prospectors to water holes.
He went out searching for those who
w ere known to be lost and guided
them to safety.
F or 13 years, aided only by Rufus,
his Newfoundland dog, Beck braved
the hardships o f the Colorado and
M o jave deserts, as w ell as Death
V a lley, and saved between 300 and
400 lives. In 1917, although warned
not to by his dog. Beck drank from
an infected spring and never recovered
from the resulting illness.
Although com p aratively unknown
today, Lou Westcott Beck ia probably
one o f the most self-sacrificing
of all the grea t Am erican adven
turers.

who asserted that tenure allows a
teacher to grow inefficient, makes
nomads of teachers because boards
fire them a fter about four and one
half years o f service to prevent tenure,
and that tenure takes too many rights
from school boards.
A ll groups opposed a bill by Senator
Harry W. Bolens, Democrat, which
would abolish the teachers retirement
surtax. Under the law, teachers con
tribute 5 per cent o f their salaries to
a retirement fund, and the state
matches this with a surtax on incomes.
The bill would abolish the surtax when
the fund reaches 35 million dollars.
Opponents o f the bill claimed it only
shifted the burden to property taxpayers
instead o f the larger income
groups, because the state had contracted
to pay into the fund.
Meanwhile the Governor received
for his signature a bill which exempts
teachers more than 65 years old from
provisions o f the tenure law.
Replenish Tax Revenue*

Carlson pointed out that the federal

Noble Message.
Sirs:
The thought of any industry having
“ the same prosperity we did in 1918
and 1919” is most inspiring. [Tim e!
May 1— “ President Roy A. Cheney of
the Underwear Institute announced in
Philadelphia: ‘The underwear industry
is prepared and in line in case of war.
Several million shirts and drawers
would be needed. . . . We will have the
same prosperity we did In 1918 and
1919.’ ” — Ed ] However, the distaff
side is slightly tense right now and
to link war and death with personal
gain is a kind o f mental sadism. Beware
o f hysterical outbursts like the
follow ing (pardon my pointing, Mr.
C heney): #
Dear Husbands, Brothers, Sweethearts,
Sons, et al:
Oh heed this noble message, won’t
you please? Remember Mr. Cheney
is your pal; you shall not lack your
share o f B. V. D.’s!
Your undies need you and you need
your undies. Go forth to war and
bring prosperity. Be sure you change
each day (including Sundays), and
pay your debt to this great industry.
I f in the muck and hell o f futile wars,
a few o f you might lose your dearloved
lives, your consolation is: you’ll
die in drawers!
Sincerely yours,
Your Mothers, Sweethearts,
Wives.

Kland Defeats Edgar
In a well played ball game at Eland
Sunday the Badgers won over the
highly touted Edgar team in a ninth
inning grandstand finish.
The score was tied at 3 all up to
that point from the 4th inning and the
fans, including a large delegation from
Edgar, w ere on edge. Excitement ran
high.
In the Badger’s half of the ninth,
the victory frame, Bohlman was safe
on E. W erner’s error, the only one o f
the game. Kaufman nudged him to
second on a single, W arning flied out
to deep center, and Sousek went down
on a fly to left.
Amid the plaudits o f the home fans,
Stoltz drove one over the center fielder’s
head and Bohlman carried home
the winning marker.

“ IT/io Goes There?”
He l l o e v e r y b o d y :
H e re ’ s a yarn from H aw a ii— but it isn’ t any tale o f soft
m oonlight and hula g irls dancing on the beach o f Waikiki. You
can fo rg e t a ll about the South Sea’ s glam or, for this is a grim
tale o f soldiering in a tropic land. A tale of madness and m urder
on a dank, mosquito-infested island under a blazing, searing
tropic sun and a sullen tropic moon.
Charles Suval of Brooklyn, N. Y ., brings us this tale, and it
happened back in 1920, when C harley was in the arm y and attached
to the 13th F ield A rtille ry , stationed at the Schofield barracks
near Honolulu. H aw a ii has a pretty sw ell reputation here
in the United States. I t ’ s supposed to be the next thing to paradise.
And I guess it is— for the tourists who liv e in the hotels
and hang around sun-bathing on the beaches all day long. But
for a soldier, C harley says, it’ s anything B U T a paradise.
Soldiers don’ t get much chance to lo a f around on the
beaches. In fact, th ey’ re lucky if they e v e r see a beach.
The Schofield barracks are 28 m iles from town. In 1920, those barracks
w eren ’ t eith er m odem or com fortable. Just a bunch o f wooden buildings
w ith darned fe w conveniences. Th e place was hot, and it sw arm ed
with mosquitoes.
“ I t w as bad enough fo r us old-tim ers,” says C harley, "b u t fo r the
rookies it w as plenty tou gh ." M ost o f the old-tim ers like C harley had
been stationed in the tropics before. T h ey w ere used to it. The rookies
had to get used to it, too— and most of them did. But a few o f them
w ere sent back to the States w ith their papers m arked "u n d es ira b le ."
And nine tim es out of ten that m eant that the poor rookie had cracked
under the strain o f sw eltering in the sun all day and lying in a hot bed
■lapping at m osquitoes all night.
Strange, Moody Y ou n gster Surprises B arrack M ates.
I lie r e w as a young lad in C harley Suval’ s outfit whom e v e r y body
spoke o f as “ Th e K id ." He w as a quiet youngster from
the first, bat the longer he stayed at the Schofield barracks, the
m ore quiet and m ore m oody he becam e. He kept to him self
m ost of the tim e, and since he didn’t seem to w ant to be bothered
with friends, the other lads in the barracks left him strictly alone.
N o one thought—least of all C h arley— that that kid w as close to
the breaking point. N or did anyone even dream that before long
he would be the cause o f a grim and heartless tra ged y. But it
w asn 't so m any days a fter that that the kid was put on guard duty
one night— and what happened th ereafter is w hat w e 'r e going to
let C harley tell us about now.
Says C h a rley: " W e had been having a torrid spell fo r m ore than a
w eek, and when it's hot in Honolulu, it’s plenty hot.' Th e air was so

dam p and m uggy that it seem ed to stick to you like glue. W e tried all
sorts o f dodges to keep cool, but none o f them seem ed to do any good.
“ One night, four of us, C orporal B radley, C orporal H ow e, a private
and m y self w ere tryin g to get som e relie f from the heat. We drank too
much o f the native drink called O K E O L E H U E . About m idnight we
started to stroll around a bit— all of us feelin g pretty good. W e walked
tow ard the gun park, and as w e neared it w e w ere ch allenged by a
sen try.”
Those four lads recognized the sentry's voice. It was The K id.
Usually he w as quiet and moody, but now his voice sounded
sullen and angry.
"W h a t do you m ean by m aking all that rac k e t? ” he grow led.
The Kid Had a Strange Look in His E ye.
Th e Kid had his .45 A rm y Colt out o f its holster. As they
cam e nearer. C harley saw that he had a w ild, strange look in his
eye. It m ight h a ve been a w arning to him, but it m eant nothing
to B rad ley. A fte r quite a fe w drinks o f okeolehue, B radley was
In a fine jo v ia l mood. Grinning from ea r to ea r, he w aved a
careless hand at Th e Kid.
“ One side, rook ie,” he said. "A n d next tim e you see the general,
don’ t fo rg e t to salu te.”
Then, suddenly. The K id 's gun went up. H e fired ! “ B rad ley,”
says C harley, "d ie d before he hit the ground. H ow e and the private
stood looking stunned. M y own brain w as spinning around in circles,
but in stinctively I tackled T h e K id around the legs, bringing him to his
knees. Then How e closed In, tryin g to help, w hile the p rivate ran back
tow ard the barracks for m ore m en.”
C harley says that by that tim e The Kid was a ravin g maniac. He
fired a shot as C harley tackled him — and another at How e as he cam e
to C h arley's aid. A fte r that he kept righ t on shooting—shooting w ild -
shooting at anything in sight.
The Kid Gets a Fresh Clip of C artridges.
C harley had a g rip on his gun hand. None o f the shots had done
atiy dam age. But in the heat o f the struggle How e g a v e C harley a push.
C h arley lost his g rip on Th e K id 's arm.
It was just fo r a second— but it w as disastrous. Th e Kid had
em ptied his gun, and now he used that m om ent o f freedom to
take out the em p ty clip from his autom atic and insert a fresh
load o f cartrid ges. B efore C harley could g et hold o f his arm he
had fired another shot— and another.
Th e first shot found its m ark in H ow e's stomach. T h e second bit
Into C h a rley's shoulder. Blood began to flow from the wound, and the
sight o f it m ade C harley m ad. " I lost all caution,” he says, "a n d all
m y ideas about taking T h e K id into the barracks unhurt. I began looking
around for a weapon, picked up a heavy stone and threw it as hard as
I could, aim ing straight for T h e K id 's h ead ."
The stone found its m ark. The K id went down and lay like
a lo g— and the tra g ic battle w as over.
Both H ow e and B rad ley w e re dead when they picked them up.
T h ey w ere buried with full m ilita ry honors. C harley went to the hospital,
and by the tim e he got out. Th e K id had been sent back to the
States. C harley doesn't know w hat becam e o f him — but he doesn’t
bear Th e Kid any ill feeling. A fte r all, it w asn 't his fault. You can

Windsors Mark
2nd Anniversary
Two years ago, on June 3, 1937,
a king married a commoner at
Monts, France. Still exiled from
his native England, apparently resigned
to a life of inconsequence,
the duke of Windsor lives contentedly
in France u-ith his American
born u-ife, the former Mrs. Wallis
Warfield Simpson. Some day he
hopes to return to England with
“ the woman I love.” Meanwhile
the Windsors make the most of an
uncomfortable situation, that of
being notoriously unimportant.
They frequently

She w as born in Dublin, Ireland,

school, studied painting fo r a while,
and then joined the G ate Players.

M iss G eraldine got experience in all

to m ake pictures in England, and

theater.
But this tim e it w as thc N ew Y ork

g a v e her a contract, (w ith six
months off each y ea r fo r the theate
r ), and she m ade tests on the
Coast, and then returned to Ireland.
She wouldn’t b elieve that she ought
to return for “ Dark V ictory ” until
she had received three letters and
a ca b leg ra m ; she'd known peopl*
who rushed to Hollywood and then
sat around and w aited everlastingly

IT ’S fashions that trend to
“ lovely la d y ” types that w ill
hold the spotlight during the
com ing months. Which brings us at
once to the theme of this story—lace,
lovely la ce! With the new styles going
in so enthusiastically fo r fem i-
I nine prettiness in hat, gown and ac-
* cessories, the logical answer needs
I must be lace, as has been the ani
sw er throughout the centuries of
fashions that have gone before,
j With the craze for lace trim s on
j hats, for billowy masses of lace at
I throat and at wrist, with the return
of the “ baby w aist’ ’ that is exquisi
itely sheer and entrancingly lace
trim m ed, with tailored laces for
daytim e w ear, with sheer pleated
laces for dress-up w ear, with picturesque
period frocks enchantingly
detailed in lace, with lace playing a
star role in boudoir fashions, with
accessories even to gloves and bags
and boutonnieres of lace, the current
m essage of lace has become
«.oo vast, too all-inclusive for words.
You just have to let the bigness of
the lace them e grow upon you as the
pageantry o f present and coming
modes pass in review .
The im portant thing to say about
modern laces is that they are so
versatile in ch aracter that there's a
lace for every occasion no matter
what the challenge m ay be. F or
that m atter it is not an ex aggera tion
to say that an entire wardrobe
could be planned o f lace. There are
fabriclike laces for tailored use,
stunning laces fo r afternoon frocks,
laces of grand dam e elegance for
form al evening w ear, sheer laces of
cobweb mesh that pleat up beautifully,
two-way stretch laces for bathing
suits anu so on and so on without
end.
The responsiveness of lace to every
mood of fashion accounts for
the fact that designers are acquiring
the lace habit with an increasing
enthusiasm as the possibilities reveal
the growing tendency of lace
producers to supply a type for every
need.
Smart Rainwear
The illustration presents three distinct
types o f frocks fashioned of
lace. A new medium for the tailored
sheer dress wrhich w ill be found ev er
so practical for sum m er w ear, is an
interesting conventionally patterned
two-tone lace as pictured to the left
in the group. Bruyere designed this
dress which has a grosgrain ribbon
belt and two ribbon bows on the
shoulder.
U tterly feminine and charm ing is
the afternoon dress shown in the
foreground to the right. V era Borca
designs this lovely frock of a delicate
but firm lace that delineates
big florals with sheer mesh between.
The ruffles around the neckline and
on the sleeves are indicative of P a r is
trends. In this dress of horizon
blue lace the ruffles lend a beguiling
feminine note with no suggestion
of fussiness. F or summer
afternoon w ear and informal e v e nings,
there is wide fa vo r expressed
for pastel laces.
An interesting feature o f sheer
afternoon lace frocks is that many
are worn over costume slips in contrasting
color. Dark laces, very
sheer, are also worn over light foundation
slips. The monotone efTect
that demands a m atching color for
the slip is equally good style.
The model in the center shows an
evening dress designed by Molyneaux.
It dem onstrates how pleasingly
sheer lace yields to pleated
treatments. The straight-fitted
sheath skirt is finely pleated, and
the dram atic balloon sleeves are
likewise pleated. Th e deep square
decolletage is noteworthy.

What to Eat and W h y
C. Houston Goudiss Describes the Role of Phosphorus
In Nutrition; Tells Where to Obtain This Mineral
By C. HOUSTON GOUDISS
T H E R E are at least 11 different m ineral salts which are
essential to the structure or functioning of the human
body. But of these, only four—calcium , phosphorus, iron
and iodine— require the careful consideration of the homem
aker. That is because a diet which furnishes adequate
amounts o f these four w ill autom atically provide the others.
But when the diet is deficient in any one of these four minerals,
disastrous consequences^
m ay result.
It is therefore of the utmost
importance that every homemak
er should know something of
their functions, ami uhat foods
supply them. In this article, tee
shall deal specifically with phos»
phorus.
V ersatile Phosphorus
It has been said that if the biographies
of the elem ents could be
______________ written, that of

* f w estm K °* a ^-Th at is
because there are
[ 14 different ways in
I I I B f ■ W^K:^ compounds
I °* Phosphorus m ay
I function in the
body. In fact,
doubtful othk
w W er inorganic eleg
f l k M i ment enters into
such a diversity of
compounds or plays an important
part in so many functions.
This m ineral is indispensable for
all the a ctive tissues of the body
and likew ise helps in regulating
the neutrality of the blood. It is
found abundantly in nerve tissue.
N eeded for Teeth and Bones
Its m ost significant role, howev
er, is to team with calcium in
givin g rigidity to the bones and
teeth. A pproxim ately 90 per cent
o f the total phosphorus of the
body and 99 per cent of the calcium
are found in the bones and
teeth.
Both these minerals are required
in generous amounts, but almost
tw ice as much phosphorus as ca lcium
should be supplied every
day. M oreover, children should
have about one-and-one-half times
cult for young women whose pelvic
bones w ere deform ed by rickets
in their early years.
A L o w - P h o s p h o r u s D ie t
It was found that rickets m ay
be associated with a low-phosphorus
diet, even when the calcium
content is high. And investigations
also determ ined that there is a
seasonal tide of blood phosphorus
which corresponds to the amount
of available sunlight. This led to
the realization that sunlight—
which we now know helps the body
to manufacture vitam in D— is
closely related to the proper utilization
of phosphorus. And today
U is w ell established that rickets
can be prevented, or cured, by a
diet containing liberal amounts of
phosphorus, calcium and vitam in
D. Vitam in D can be obtained
from direct sunshine, but where
this is not availab le in adequate
amounts, cod-liver oil, irradiated
foods, or those fortified with a
vitam in D concentrate w ill supply
this necessary substance.
M ake Use of Sunlight
A s we approach the season when
the greatest amount of sunshine
is available, hom em akers should
see to it that not only the children,
but ev ery m em ber of the
fam ily spend as much tim e as
possible in the sunlight. This w ill
help to prom ote the proper utilization
of phosphorus and calcium .
And both teeth and bones w ill
benefit, as w ell as the general
health.
Where to Find Phosphorus
E v ery hom em aker should acquaint
herself with the foods that
supply phosphorus m ost abundantly,
so that she w ill be prepared to
include this m ineral in the diet
every day. E g g yolk and dried
beans are both valuable sources

disease m ay result in deform ities
of the chest and pelvic bones, as
w ell as the m ore fa m ilia r bow

Investigators have spent many
years in discovering how to prevent
and cure this disease which
has m ade life m iserable for so
many children and which has farreaching
effects that ca rry over
into later life. F or exam ple, adults
who have bow legs or a pigeon
breast as a result o f childhood
including almonds, peanuts, pecans
and walnuts, furnish significant
amounts. And this m ineral
is found in dried fruits such as
raisins, figs and prunes, and in
much sm aller quantities in ve g etables,
such as spinach, cauliflower,
string beans, carrots and brussels
sprouts.
Milk supplies phosphorus, though
not in such generous amounts as
calcium. H ow ever, if you follow
the rule of a quart o f m ilk daily

That adage, "p rep a re for a rainy
d a y ,” ever instilled in the minds of
the young, has been taken literally
in the realm of fashion. The modern
interpretation of stylish rainw
ea r is reflected in the ve^y attractive
rain cape here pictures Surely
some little g ir l’s geography book
must have inspired this all-Am erica
raincape in that it is printed with a
m ap of the United States, rivers and
mountains and borderlines included.
It comes either with a b a h m h k a to

Skirts and blouses are usually on
the wane by the tim e really w arm
w eather sets in and the lightweight
suit usually is the only opportunity
for continuing this casual style. But
not so this year, at least if the prom inence
o f spun rayon, linen and cotton
skirts are any indication.
The pleated all-round skirt is especially
good in summer fabrics,
which m ay account for the increased
popularity, and not only the skirt
departm ents but the blouse and
sum m er sw eater departm ents are
preparing for much activity.
The practicality o f the skirt and
blouse or sw eater is undeniable. It
is easy to have a number o f changes
at little outlay and there is less necessity
o f laundering than with a
number of one-piece frocks.

Feminine Frills
On Shirtwaists
Sportswear is not being neglected,
even among the frills and ruffles of
the m ajority of feminine clothes,
and the shirtw aist is making a conspicuous
appearance, changed in
some cases by the addition of pleated
and gathered fullness, but still
basically the same.
In some instances this styJe is
seen with additional color contrasts,
among them one shirtwaist dress
with rose top and navy skirt, another
with a pink and white striped
top and pink shirt, and others solid
pastel shirtwaist frocks with '-ontrasting
b r i g h t cummerbunds
around the waist.

Mr. and Mrs. Boruget o f Stanley
accompanied Anton Morien o f Chippewa
Falls to his home here over the
week-end.
Leona Morien entertained several
guests Thursday, May 18, it being her
birthday anniversary.
Jease James was a God-fearing man
who carried a Bible, prayed fo r guidance,
and never drew fo r hia aixshooter
except in self-defense.
That unfam iliar picture o f the notorious
outlaw was drawn fo r motion
picture director Henry King, by oldtimers
in the Missouri Ozarks who
once knew the James brothers.
K in g was in the Ozarks seeking locales
fo r Darryl F. Zanuck’s production,
“ Jesse James,” the 20th Century-
Fox Technicolor epic o f the most
colorful desperado who ever lived,
which stars Tyrone Power, Henry
Fonda, Nancy K elly and Randolph
Scott at the Badger Theatre on May
30, 31, and June 1. Matinee on Memorial
Day at 2:30.
“ Those who knew him or heard
about him as youngsters,” said Director
King, “ believe that Jesse James
was driven to a life o f crime by the
persecution o f enemies, and that the
efforts o f unscrupulous railroad o fficials
to steal his mother’s farm at
Sedalia, Missouri, fo r a right-of-w ay,
started him on hia bloody trail of
banditry.
“ In the film, we do not g lo rify him;
neither do we picture him aa entirely
black. W’e have tried to respect the
judgment o f historians, without fo rgettin
g what those mountain people
who were Jesse James’ sworn friends
thought o f him.”
