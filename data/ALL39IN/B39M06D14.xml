    RO JECT There have been busy times around the Black River Gun Skeet club

    They have enlarged the cottage so that the building is now 16x52 feet and
    built an eight-foot porch the full length They have built a skeet trap and
    rifle range Most of the work has been done by members of the club There are
    around 100 members but the Gun Skeet is no exception to the general rule
    that not all members work The last remark is our own generalization not that
    of any of the club The latest addition has been the erection of two brooder
    houses each 10x12 complete with heating units two shelter pens 12x24 and two
    pens 50x100 All covered with wire so that the pheasants for which they are
    intended cannot fly out and will not have to have their wings clipped The
    pen and brooders are built according to the conservation department
    specifications and members o f the local conservation station state that the
    club has a fine set-up They expect to obtain 700 day-old pheasant chicks
    about June 18th and will keep a man at the club to care for them They
    contemplate getting 350 more a little later on It costs the Conservation
    department 27c for each chick they deliver They are brought by car direct
    from the Poynette game farm In all there will be a big addition to the
    pheasants of the county this year as the Alma Center club is sponsoring
    raising 500 which have already been delivered to them and they also received
    a shipment of 20 full grown pheasants received as winners of the feeding
    contest Melrose sportsmen also received 20 full grown pheasants for their

    Settlers E A R L Y SETTLEMENT OF B LACK R IV E R V A L L E Y (B y A D
    Polleys) Opinions differ as to the exact date o f first settlement and as to
    the ones making the first settlement The statement from Rob rt Douglas was
    he embarked at Prairie du Chien on the steamboat Osprey early in April 1839
    arriving at Prairie La Crosse on the 9th where he left the steamer and the
    Mississippi The First Farm Wending his way up the Black River Valley he
    reached a point where he staked out a claim Having been a coal miner he was
    looking for outcroppings of coal along the side streams of Black river
    Having discovered a fine farming region he became transformed from miner to
    farmer in a single day although in succeeding years he explored every
    tributary of the river below the falls from mouth to source in search o f
    coal deposits He gave to his location the name of Dumfries his native town
    in Scotland While authorities differ somewhat concerning events there has
    never been any doubt about Dougles being the first farmer in the Black river
    valley and Spaulding the second A t the time Spaulding harvested his first
    crop Douglas harvested his third one which leaves the town of Melrose the
    undisputed right to be called the cradle o f agriculture in the Black river
    valley The First Saw Mills The preserved diaries and narratives of early day
    explorers reveal that pine logs were cut on Black river and run to St Louis
    where they were cut into lumber by the use of the whip-saw The first
    permanent settlers for the manufacture of lumber was by Jacob Spaulding and
    the Wood Brothers heading a party of 17 who came in August 1839 Different
    writers have given different dates varying from the first to the 27 of the
    month Judge George Gale founder of Galesville and a man o f prominence
    visited Jackson county for the purpose of obtaining historical data and
    wrote from Black River Falls May 30 1860 That date being only 21 years from
    the coming of the first white man accurate information was easily secured
    His findings were published in the Galesville Transcript at the time His
    article starts out by giving the names of the entire expedition Sawmills The
    first sawmill was built at the Falls and a larger one the next spring During
    the following years Spaulding and the Wood brothers had much trouble
    resulting in the former buying the interests of the Woods in May 1841
    Trouble did not cease however and a series of lawsuits followed lasting
    nearly 20 years In September 1839 Hon James O Neill now o f Clark county and
    his brother Alexander O Neill came to the river and commenced getting out
    lumber at Pigeon B lu ff bottom below the mouth of Robinson s creek The next
    spring they commenced building the mill at Perry s Jonathan Nichols came to
    the river in the spring of 1840 and during the summer put up a sawmill at
    the mouth o f Nichols creek He died in June 1851 at Thomas Douglas on his
    return from Dubuque In 1843 Robert Douglas put up a sawmill on a creek near
    his farm In 1844 Thomas and Peter Hall erected a mill at the mouth of H all
    s creek above the Falls and Shepperd and Valentine one on Squaw Creek below
    the Falls The following year John Morrison put up a mill on Morrison creek
    John and William K Levis another on Levis creek and John Adams the third on
    Black river 12 miles above the Falls The Angles mill was put up by Paul
    Knight and B F Johnson in 1846 I am not advised of the time of the erection
    of Capt Hamilton s eight miles above the Falls but it was probably about the
    same time In addition to the mills listed by Judge Gale other mills were
    built in early days one at North Bend by Robt and Thomas Douglas in 1845 In
    1844 James O Neill founder of Neillsville built a mill on O Neill creek In
    the same year a mill was put in operation 18 miles above and operated by a
    second owner by the name of Eaton for several years In 1846 Davy Robinson
    had a mill in operation on Robinson creek and Myrick and Miller one on
    Wednes Cr6ck In 1848 Hon E L Brockway built a mill at the Lower Falls called
    Brockway town To that was added the first circular mill in 1854 B SBrewer
    built the first steam mill on the river in 1856 at Melrose This however is
    not a complete list of the early day sawmills all of which were of the mulay
    or sash saw type The Mormons Continuing the narratives of Judge Gale we find
    that In 1842 early in the spring a party of about 50 Mormons from Nauvoo 111
    under the charge of Elders White Curtis and Miller came to the river to get
    out lumber for their new city o f Nauvoo Elder John Miller was the president
    of the company The Mormon W ar commenced almost immediately after their
    arrival After a year of hostilities the Mormons purchased the entire
    interests of Spaulding operating the mills for more than a year Immediately
    a fter hearing of the death of Jo Smith in 1844 all the Mormons of Black
    River either sold out their property or abandoned it purchased all the guns
    they could find on Black river and 73 of Myrick and Miller of La Crosse and
    left for Nauvoo never LEA V E S FROM D IA R Y OF W H IT E BOY TAKEN CAPTIVE
    BY IN D IANS OF BLACK R IV E R V A L L E Y (The following vivid account is
    taken from a diary written by a white man of Danish birth by name of Frank
    Johnson or Jensen who when only 16 years old was taken captive near the East
    fork of Black River by Indians who ambushed his party killing all others but
    Jensen the young survivor later being adopted by the tribe s medicine man He
    remained with the Indians eight years before going to La Crosse where he
    later became a merchant) During the third year the summer of probably 1867
    something happened that came very near ending my life as well as the lives
    of all of us One night we heard a terrible yell I had learned to know what
    the d ifferent yells meant and this was a danger yell Something terrible was
    to happen In less time than it takes to tell it old and young braves and
    squaws ponies and even dogs all huddled together as if seeking protection
    Wolves bears deer and all kinds of animals were making hideous noises and
    shrieks of birds could be heard from tops of trees The sky was blood red The
    woods were on fire No smoke had yet come our way but before daylight every
    tepee was down and loaded on the backs of ponies All o f our equipments were
    in one great pile Not a vestige was scattered about We were at the highest
    points and our braves were climbing tall pine trees to try to discover about
    how fa r the fire was away from us Daylight came and with it more
    preparations for flight There must have been more than a thousand o f us
    gathered together Several fine-beaded buckskins were hung up into the outer
    branches of tall trees as offerings to our Great Spirit with many earnest
    prayers for His protection When that was done all who were able to do so
    fell down with their faces to the ground I with the rest This was the first
    time I had ever seen a real spirit worship or heard audible prayers offered
    and let me assure you that while the words in their supplications would have
    been scoffed at in a civilized world it was a real earnest worship When it
    was over we were all seated Indian fashion in the largest circle o f Indians
    I have ever seen and had to witness another service which I never could
    really enjoy A very sharp little knife or flint was passed from one brave to
    another each one made a small opening in his right arm so that the blood
    flowed freely A leaf was passed with blood from one to another which he
    would place upon his own wound and so from brave to brave until all had
    exchanged blood Other leaves were laid on the wound to heal them a fterwards
    Young braves papooses and squaws did not exchange blood but blood of others
    was sprinkled in their faces It was a bloody sight but it pleased the Great
    Spirit and was a worship After this the pipe o f peace was smoked We ate
    what we could find but we did not move that day nor the following night Our
    ponies were unloaded but were kept at hand In fact our ponies seemed to know
    of the danger as much as we did No tepees were raised smoke now started to
    come in upon us thick and fast All of our traps were again loaded and from
    several tree tops where our lookouts were watching great yells arose The
    wind now changed so as to bring the great fire our way and before we were
    really aware of it the smoke became so thick that we could scarcely see one
    another So away we flew I did not then know how Indians moved in a case o f
    that kind Each one made a noise like aw aw kee kee and all I could hear was
    that noise and yells I had my hand on a pole hanging on the side of one o f
    our ponies An old squaw to satisfy herself that I was there would put her
    hand on mine once in a while I had to gasp for breath the smoke became worse
    and the heat became intense I finally fell down We must have traveled two or
    three miles when I fell and all I can remember then was that I stuck my head
    under leaves and brush in order to breathe What happened after that I do not
    know except as I was told afterwards that two squaws had carried me nearly
    four miles to the east fork of Black river where that river bends towards
    the east There I found myself in water to my arm pits surrounded by several
    squaws and then I was fully restored to consciousness We were out (C o n tin
    u e d on page 7) to return with the avowed intention o f fighting the
    Gentiles A settlement of Mormons back of La Crosse and in Mormon Coulee left
    at the same time The lumber on hand at the Falls and the material from the
    demolished buildings there was rafted down river to La Crosse and sold to
    Myrick and Miller for a song and was used in the first buildings erected in
    La Crosse Ferry Boats Black river was supplied with 17 ferryboats at the
    same number of locations The first one was at Melrose by Robert and Thomas
    Douglas in 1852 and launched at a celebration on Ju ly 4 that year and was
    the last one to operate after 44 years of service in 1896 and then known as
    Gaylord s ferry Bridges Bridges displaced some of the ferryboats but not all
    of them The one at Lower Falls established by E L Brockway in the late f if
    ties was put out of commission by Brockway himself when he erected a toll
    bridge in 1866 the only toll bridge ever operated on the river MBHMHMHHMi PA

    Ju n e 14 1939 JA M E S A F R EA R We regret to state that in making up the
    Banner-Journal last week an article regarding the late Congressman James A
    Frear was unintentionally omitted The article is taken from the Hudson
    Star-Observer Mr Frear s home-town newspaper and is a very interesting
    account o f Mr Frear s long and useful career in public service James A
    Frear former congressman and Hudson s most prominent political leader o f
    the past forty years died suddenly o f a heart attack at a Washington D C
    hospital Sunday afternoon He was 77 years old Mr Frear had been under
    treatment for a kidney ailment at the hospital for the past few weeks and
    was apparently recovering splendidly and had planned to leave the hospital
    on Monday Telegrams received here on Sunday announced that funeral services
    were to be held at Washington a t 2 o clock Wdnesday afternoon Besides his
    widow he is survived by one son Phil Frear o f Washington D C and one
    daughter Mrs Marguerite Johnson of New York City Mr Frear who first learned
    his politics in that rugged period of American political life at the turn o
    f the century when no quarter was asked and none given had an unusually busy
    and successful career and successively served his community state and nation
    as city attorney of Hudson district attorney of St Croix county member o f
    the Wisconsin Assembly member of the state senate secretary of state and
    Member of Congress He had the distinction of never having been defeated for
    political office He retired from politics in 1935 after 22 consecutive years
    of public service as congressman from this district For a dozen years Mr
    Frear was chairman of the Wisconsin delegation in Congress a delegation that
    made history in its fight against the old strangling gag rules For years he
    served as a member of the important House Ways and Means committee His
    successful opposition to the porkbarrel flood control bill of the 70th
    session o f Congress and his efforts in behalf of adequate Indian relief
    legislation and the removal of corruption and inefficiency from the Indian
    bureau were given nation-wide recognition In Mr Frear s long record as a
    congressman one o f his most courageous stands was taken in 1917 when he
    joined 49 other members of the House of Congress and voted against the
    declaration of war against German Although he and the willfu l few were
    forced to take plenty of abuse during the period o f war hysteria events in
    later years proved that Mr Frear and his anti-war colleagues were absolutely
    right in their course Some years after the war Mr Frear in commenting upon
    his antiwar vote explained his position as follows I did not believe that
    the moral or constitutional right existed to conscript American youth to be
    killed fighting Europe s battles The tremendous price then paid and the
    hopelessness of it all with more wars certain to follow the great arma- SHIP

    nations the changing of more than h alf o f Europe from parliamentary
    governments into dictatorships since that war and the uncertainty o f
    civilization now confronted by more wars all these were not visioned by
    those of us opposed to war any more than by the majority who voted fo r it
    But I did not believe that even a small fraction o f our people would have
    voted for our entry into that war nor in our right to send American vessels
    into the known war zone as a test o f freedom of the seas In a move to guard
    against future unwarranted wars Mr Frear devoted much time in his later
    years in Congress in an attempt to secure adoption o f a constitutional
    amendment making it mandatory to take a plebiscite o f the people before
    Congress can declare war In this attempt he was unsuccessful As a lawmaker a
    t Washington he supported the national budget law in 1922 opposed every move
    for a consumption or sales tax worked in beh a lf o f the veterans
    compensation act and favored all sound labor and agricultural legislation
    His course on matters o f national importance so whole-heartedly met the
    approval of his constituents that he was elected to Congress for eleven
    conscutive terms retiring voluntarily in 1935 after refusing to run for
    re-election in the fall o f 1934 Mr Frear was b om in Hudson on October 24
    1861 and when he was but two weeks old his father Arron Humphrey Frear
    answered Lincoln s first call for volunteers and left for the Civil war as a
    member of the Hudson city guard A fter the war the family lived in Chicago
    for a time but Mr Frear spent much of his youth here and during summer
    vacations worked at the Omaha car repair shops He attended Lawrence
    University at Appleton Wis in 1878 and it was during that year that his
    father received an appointment in the a d ju tant general s office at
    Washington D C and the family left Hudson in October o f that year and moved
    to Washington where the son James A attended the National Law University
    Before completing his law education Mr Frear served a period of enlistment
    with the U S signal corps at Fort Myer Virginia A fter graduating from the
    National Law University in 1884 Mr Frear with his savings o f $250 returned
    to Hudson his boyhood home to practice law He entered the law offices of Col
    John C Spooner who in the following year was elected U S Senator In those
    early years Frear as a young lawyer had the good fortune to come in contact
    with such outstanding attorneys as Col Spooner Frank Kellogg later U S
    senator and secretary o f state Cush Davis later U S senator Moses and
    Newell Clapp the former also a senator in later years and John W Bashford
    Soon after returning to Hudson Mr Frear and Capt Peyton Goss organized as a
    member o f the state military organization for 11 years retiring as a
    colonel and judge advocate of Wisconsin Mr Frear early took an interest in
    Hudson city politics and was appointed city attorney a position he held
    several years While serving as city attorney he widened his political scope
    and was chosen as a compromise chairman o f the St Croix county Republican
    convention after which he was soon definitely aligned with the new political
    faction in the state headed by Robert M La Follette Sr and throughout his
    latter political career he remained a La Follette progressive Mr Frear was
    married to Harriet E Wood in Washington D C in 1889 returning to Hudson to
    reside To Mrs Frear who was his constant advisor Mr Frear credited many of
    the good results that came to his family in later life Governor Upham in
    April 1896 appointed Mr Frear the district attorney of St Croix county to
    fill the vacancy caused by the resignation o f District Attorney Helms who
    had been elected to the circuit bench Mr Frear was elected district attorney
    for three conscutive terms there- after As a result o f Mr Frear s splendid
    record as a prosecuting attorney he was elected a Member o f the Assembly
    from St Croix county in 1902 and a member o f the state senate in 1904 As a
    member o f the 1903 and 1905 sessions o f the state legislature Mr Frear was
    an ardent supporter o f the La Follette reform measures which included
    provisions for the direct primary and regulation and control of railroads
    While in the state legislature Mr Frear served as chairman of the senate
    investigation committee on state insurance and chairman of the Wisconsin
    legislative insurance investigation during 1906 His legislative experience
    at Madison gave Mr Frear a statewide acquaintance and in one o f his hardest
    fought campaigns he was elected secretary of state on the Republican ticket
    in the fall of 1906 He was re-elected secretary of state in 1908 and 1910 Mr
    Frear was elected to congress the first time in the fall of 1912 and he was
    re-elected for ten consec utive terms after that In the historic election o
    f 1912 Mr Frear more or less neglected his own campaign in this
    congressional district and supported the first nation-wide attempt to place
    the elder La Follette in the White House In 1924 when Senator La Follette
    again was a candidate fo r president on the Third Party ticket Mr Frear was
    among his staunch supporters Although still classed as a La Follette
    progressive he came out for the Hoover-Curtis Republican ticket in August
    1928 This was his last active campaign in support o f a national ticket and
    in the campaigns o f 1930 and 1932 he devoted his time largely in behalf of
    his own campaign in this district NOTICE OF ANNUAL ME ET IN G The annual

    Rudolph Esq whose reputation for flinging a horsehide bound sphere has long
    since expanded over a generous spread of northwestern geography gave an
    exhibit of his ability at the fair grounds under the Mazdas last Thursday
    night When the work was all done the Esquire had hung a horsecollar down
    over the ears (and they weren t all small ones) o f every bird that sported
    the visiting label on his bosom Only two bingles blossomed off his
    fireballing and neither of them were the kind a good red-blooded baseballer
    would want to brag about A n Irish lad from the clan Garaghan and a sweet
    looking ball player gathered both of the sins agin R udy s twirling The
    first of Garaghan s blows came in the third a lazy liner over the Teeples
    noggin The second was an infield scratch and came in the fifth Wrapped all
    around these blows were 18 nice juicy strikeouts each of which got a squeel
    or two from the stands That s the story o f the enemy attack The tale o f
    the deeds perpetrated again Twelve socks o f varying lengths good for eight
    paycounts by the Merchantmen is something else flew off the sticks o f the
    local warriors The prize now being a triple which we ordered Kleven to sock
    to left center in the fifth Hank always was an obliging gink so he followed
    order to a T Teeples and E Rudy bange J out dual base smacks for the other
    pair o f long hits which came during the show The Punch hits were smacked
    out by A rthur Rudolph who bingled in the first and again in the 7th and
    sent a pair of gents scampering home each time making a total o f four runs
    driven in for the evening which is a good piece of swatting for any cleanup
    hitter The other Rudolph boy the one that throws baseballs alone outhit his
    foe by getting a double a single and a stroll beside a run counting
    sacrifice fly to center E rnie s single counted a tally in the third making
    two batted in So the story o f the ball game is largely a story o f the
    heroics performed by the Rudolph family The Merchants lost no time in giving
    their hurler something to toil on They started off with two scores in the
    first which came about this wise Randles lined a hit over second paused
    while Kleven popped to Briggs the receiver and scooted to third on Teeples
    two-based to right A R udolph whizzed a hit between first and second to send
    the bojrs galloping into the home office Free transportation was issued to E
    Rudolph after Hoard had popped to Isaacs but the boys were le ft marooned
    when Garaghan tossed out Hauser The next batch o f profitable business was
    transacted in the third A rt got two bags for himself when A Briggs dropped
    his long fly to center He counted on his brothers single to left The B R
    Falls boys chose the 6th as a nice time to get the 4th run and went about it
    like this E Rudolph picked a spot between left and center to bound the ball
    off the fence for two bases Thompson blooped a single over short Rudy going
    to 3rd The redskin started a double steal but was sunk at second The
    Merchant twirler however successfully pilfered the plate In chapter seven
    the locals gave Garaghan all he could tolerate Hits by Randles Kleven and A
    rt R and a sacrifice fly by the B R F twirler counted three for the
    Merchants and effected the removal o f Garaghan from the turret Mish tried a
    little left-handed trickery in the 8th but didn t get by so hot The fin al
    tally being charged against his wrong hand stuff Hebert waited through fo ur
    off center pitches for a pass and went to second when Randles survived on a
    fielders choice Teeples biffed an infield h it and Charley came home and so
    it was that the 4th straight win was corraled by the county seat Merchants
    Most everybody knew that Satchell Paige and his cohorts will be at the fa ir
    grounds here on Wednesday June 14 in another of those great exhibitions in
    high class baseball This Paige gent is probably the greatest baseball
    pitcher who will ever set a spike in Jackson county turf So if you missed it

    American Legion meets second and fourth Tuesday each month FATHER S DAY June
    18th mm Time to Qive Dad his Favorite X n tv r H EM MY W R IT E S Judging
    from suggestions coming to me from Jackson county I infer that you are
    interested in getting a news letter from me The Finance committee and the
    Governor have spent weeks in preparing a tax bill Several plans have
    received consideration particularly a general sales tax proposition The
    Progressives and Democrats are unanimous towards opposition of such a
    measure The Republicans were apparently divided and it was quite evident
    that such a bill could not pass The bill finally agreed upon by the
    Republicans is a compromise bill which levies an additional tax on beer
    liquor wines soft drinks cigarette cigars chain stores and theatres - I t
    also lower the exemptions in the normal income tax law so that a single
    person would only have $600 and a married couple $1500 exemptions with
    deduction for dependent children lowered to $300 per child The Democrats and
    Progressives will recommend some changes in the bill However in view o f the
    fact that they have discarded the general sales tax idea the Assembly will
    probably reach an agreement without much delay A bill relating to official
    ballots and which instructs the Secretary o f State to provide space for
    such parties as have candidates for U S President and Vice-president and
    makes no provision for parties who have no such candidates was engrossed by
    a vote of 45 to 43 Fifteen Republicans and Democrats voted with Progressives
    to kill the bill I f this bill is finally passed it is conceded that it will
    eliminate the Progressive party from the ballot Such action might compel the
    Progressives to run as Progressive Republicans or Progressive Democrats as
    they did years ago The Republicans are beginning to worry more about this

    Company of which Timan A Johnson is manager The company was organized in
    1900 as a wholesale outlet for fruit produce and groceries Three years later
    the building and stock were destroyed by fire and the next year reorganized
    to deal in fruits and produce Originally they started with a yellow wagon
    and one gray horse with Mr Johnson making the deliveries In 1903 he went to
    Kansas City and purchased the first carload of bananas to be shipped into
    Idaho During the year he purchased three carloads of bananas and the third
    was a part of the merchandize destroyed by fire The commission company has
    grown magically during the intervening years and now is a business o f no
    small proportions It has been reincorporated and renamed and will be known
    as the Boise Fruit Produce Company Inc Mr Johnson retains his position as
    manager which he has been ever since 1907 He visited here recently Miss Emma

    COMMITTEE MEETS The committee appointed to secure and place markers at a
    number of the historic places in Jackson county met at the residence of A P
    Jones last Thursday evening The county board having appropriated the money
    direct to the Jackson County Historical Society no further organization was
    considered necessary The committee consisting o f David Blencoe A D Polleys
    A O Burnett M W Smith Dr E A Petzke Judge H M Perry Mrs J H Mills Anton
    Hauger and Lawrence Jones will purchase the markers determine where they are
    to be installed what inscriptions shall be upon them and pay all bills A t
    the present it is believed the time is too short to attempt to have more
    than two or three markers installed by the time o f the Centennial and
    Homecoming The two first to be installed will mark the sites of the sawmill
    erected in 1819 and the site o f the Wood Bros and Spaulding sawmill erected
    in 1839 The marker for the first will be placed on the small park near the
    power house and the other almost directly across Water street Both mills
    were erected south of Town Creek the Woods-Spaulding m ill being where the
    Co-op oil station is now located I t is the opinion o i the committee that a
    more pretentious marker should be erected in honor o i the iirst permanent
    settlement and more time will be taken to decide just what shall be its
    nature and location COOPER-K OLBEN1CK On Friday June 9 1939 at 2 o clock a

    their spring session voted to conduct the 1939 grasshopper control program
    on a township instead of a county basis Under this plan each township will
    if necessary set up a mixing station to mix bait for the farmers in that
    township To date few farmers have reported finding many small grasshoppers
    The dry weather during the past few weeks should have been ideal for
    hatching weather but the absence of many small hoppers should indicate that
    we need not be so concerned about a control program this year Should any one
    find an infected area which they think should be covered with poison they
    should get in touch with their town chairman or this office We have a supply
    of sodium arsenite on hand which can be trucked to any township O f the many
    cage tests conducted last year to determine the effectiveness of the
    different bait mixtures it was found that the mixtures of whey and sawdust
    gave as good results as the higher priced mixtures Bran and molasses make
    the mixtures more attractive but the additional cost is not justified Mill
    screenings are not recommended Mixtures of poison water and sawdust gave
    good results Sheep Farmers who have notified this office that they wish to
    have their sheep dipped should not become too concerned if the portable
    dipping rig does not stop at your farm during the next few days Guy Strong
    has drawn up a schedule to be followed in moving from farm to farm Such a
    schedule should not only save mileage but should make it possible to dip
    more sheep each day Mr Strong lives nine miles west of B R Falls on County
    Trunk P Any one wishing any information should get in touch with Mr Strong
    or this office Lamb Feeding Many sheepmen it is expected will continue creep
    feeding o f lambs even after their flocks have been turned on pasture This
    practice is being followed by an increasing number of Wisconsin s successful
    flockmasters A E Darlow in charge of the flocks of the University of
    Wisconsin has found that when grass is still short there is extreme need for
    grain to be supplied The young tender grass he says is high in protein and a
    balance is struck when grains are used with grass in the early weeks of
    pasture feeding Darlow feels that mixtures of grains in which corn comprises
    at least one-half are excellent for supplementing the scanty pastures and
    corn is now the most economical feed for livestock use Com need not be
    ground for lambs that are at least a month old he states and the other
    grains used may also be fed without grinding Feeding trials have shown that
    lambs still nursing will made one hundred pounds gain on one hundred pounds
    grain fed and sheepmen find that it s the cheap gains that add to the sheep
    income The lambs that are forced along will not only make better and cheaper
    gains but will be ready for the June or Ju ly market when prices are
    generally most attractive Here in Wisconsin our sheep must be fitted into
    farming in a way that will make the greatest use o f pasture concludes
    Darlow To have this accomplished our lambs should go to market off the grass
    Instead of depending upon pasture in the early season and then feeding grain
    when pasture is burned and dry we are attempting to have our sheep men feed
    grain in the early season and keep the lambs thriving without a break With
    this system of production we will have them ready for market before the hot
    dry season This may be done only when the early gains ar rapid Creep feeding
    insures these rapid increases in weight County Co-Op Picnic The public is

    members Probably no other measure upon which there has been such extensive
    discussion in and out o f congress has been quite so long delayed and
    postponed There are many other measures however which have been held in
    committees under the ancient rules which have permitted arbitrary control by
    a few men in committees Congress is a body which has freedom of speech to
    the limit but freedom of legislative action is limited by a form of
    organized control which has existed from the days o f President Martin Van
    Buren a century ago The Townsend bill H R 2 originally for which H R 6466
    was substituted in the committee by common consent had its first hearing
    before the Ways and Means committee at this session The hearings continued
    five weeks and the testimony taken fills hundreds o f pages In the
    discussion nearly every aspect o f oldage pension legislation was given
    consideration The committee then reported the bill without recommendation 23
    of the 25 members voting for such action though a majority probably was not
    favorable to the measure On the floor only four hours were allowed fo r
    debate one-half to each side o f the question Then came the roll-call and
    the bill was defeated by a vote of 97 for to 302 against Dr Townsend who had
    been in Washington several weeks sat in the gallery when the vote was taken
    There were more Republican than Democratic votes for the bill but partisan
    lines were not drawn Seven Wisconsin members voted for the bill two against
    and one not voting On a partisan basis there were 55 Republicans 40
    Democrats and 2 Progressives for the bill Contrary to many press reports H R
    6466 did not provide a monthly pension o f $200 It provided for a general
    gross income tax of one-half o f one per cent on manufacturers and producers
    and two per cent on professional people and retailers with wage earners
    exempted The proceeds of such taxes were to be distributed pro rata among
    pensioners eligible to receive it No accurate estimate has been made as to
    how much revenue would be raised how many would be eligible to receive the
    pension nor how much the monthly payments would be all o f which would
    depend to a large degree upon the national income Estimates have been made
    that the revenues might be sufficient to pay from $40 to $50 per month Were
    prosperity to return the revenue would increase accordingly with the
    prospect of the number o f applicants becoming less No state nor county
    contributions would be required The census o f 1940 probably will provide
    more accurate statistics as to the number of people over 60 Following came
    the proposed amendments to the present Social Security law from the Ways and
    Means Committee One of the more important of them would abandon the plan to
    build up a fifty-billion-dollar reserve fund from pay-roll taxes in the next
    30 years That feature o f the law has been criticized as even present
    receipts exceed the amount paid by the federal government as its share of
    the pensions and an excess of a couple hundred millions a year has been paid
    into the Treasury and borrowed and spent for the running expenses of the
    government Instead a smaller reserve will be established and placed in the
    hands of trustees Among the many amendments one of the outstanding is to
    increase the federal share o f old-age pensions from a maximum o f $15 per
    person to $20 However that amendment would mean little to most states A t
    present state and counties have to match the amount of federal moneys paid
    to pensioners Very few states have found it possible to pay $15 per month
    and consequently the average pension has been $20 in many states and in some
    much less thus reducing the federal aid accordingly So while on the surface
    of things the amendment might lead the old folks to believe that a total
    pension of $40 per month was in prospect probably not more than five o f the
    48 states would be able to match the federal aid and the amount o f the
    pensions would be governed by what states and counties could pay rather than
    by the size o f the federal grant To increase the average o f a state like
    Wisconsin to $40 per month the state and counties would have to increase the
    pension funds to about double what they now are to obtain the maximum In
    numerous states the monthly average is now less than $10 and in all
    endeavors are being made to find new forms of taxes to meet present state
    needs The amendment proposed by the Ways and Means Committtee even if
    adopted is much o f an eloquent gesture and even eloquent gestures buy
    little in these times I f gold in plenty meant prosperity our own land would
    be riding the crest o f a prosperity boom but somehow that does not seem to
    be its meaning A year ago our country held half the gold of the entire world
    most of it safely tucked away in the Kentucky hills By Ju ly 1st its supply
    will be increased to sixteen billions or two-thirds the world supply Imports
    continue to roll in at the rate o f a h a lf billion monthly from the scanty
    stores held by European nations some o f it probably in payment for war
    supplies and the rest fo r safe keeping in case the conflagration starts
    across the waters A t the same rate o f increase another year we shall be
    holding all but two billions or more than 92 per cent o f all the gold that
    has been produced in a century in every part of the world Just what that
    will mean nobody seems to know Still no American citizen can hoard away more
    than $100 in gold coin or bullion without being in danger o f going to the
    penitentiary A bout the only place one o f us would dare to spend a $20 gold

    explanation under oath o f where we got it The proposed amendment to the
    Neutrality law repealing some o f the embargo provisions and placing greater
    power in the hands of the chief executive to make neutrality fit where and
    when is likely to cause a further delay in adjournment The Senate committee
    had balked upon such further modification of the present insufficient law so
    the House leaders are arranging to start the move in that body where the
    administration has a more firm control of committees However the committee
    on Foreign Affairs may find that the House members will be no more pliant
    than the senators upon proposals to make neutrality mean less instead of
    more Even now the State department continues to issue permits for steadily
    increasing exports of war materials to countries at war and others anxious
    to get into one That may help pile up the figures on foreign trade and our
    balance of trade but if ever this country got a lesson of any kind by bitter
    experience it was in that o f attempting to keep out of the World war by
    furnishing billions in supplies to the countries over-seas I f we are to
    have neutrality it cannot be by making billions in foreign trade for the war

    excerpts from Frances Newton s article Why Are They Stars in the February

    in our National Emblem is given in the Congressional Act of June 14 1777
    which adopted the flag and which prescribed that the Union be thirteen stars
    in a blue field representing a new constellation symbolizing as previously
    stated stars in the heavens signaling to mankind the birth of the first
    nation on earth dedicated to personal and religious liberty a sanctuary to
    which men and women the world over oppressed because of religious and other
    beliefs might take refuge and enjoy Life Liberty and the Pursuit of
    Happiness When Congress wrote the words o f the Act they were a challenge to
    the old world and a promise to the new Today they remain a challenge and a
    promise more timely than ever In a world gone mad the symbolism of the stars
    pledges that in one country at least sanity and decency shall prevail H

    postmaster at Hixton reports that in May they had the biggest business of
    all time surpassing that of December by some $17 December had previously
    been their record breaker This excess business is mostly due to the
    hatcheries of the township Lien s Hatchery has been taking care of all the
    shipping for the four in that region Hagen s Ole T Johnson s and the
    Northfield hatchery Up to this time they have shipped over 30 000 day-old
    cockerels to the drouth and grasshopper infested areas of Minnesota Montana
    and the Dakotas Last Friday shipments were going to Aberdeen S D Leota N D
    Pine River Minn There have been repeat orders up to three or four shipments
    to the same localities The chicks are sexed after hatching and other years
    the cockerels have been drowned as there was no demand for them outside of a
    few locally This year a market was found in the drouth area which has been
    heavily infested Iwith grasshoppers in recent years The chicks will be fed
    for a time and then turned out to feed on grasshoppers No telling what they
    will do to the grasshoppers but they certainly boomed business in the Hixton
    postoffice They are sold at the hatchery for $1 00 per hundred and the cost
    of shipment brings the price to the purchaser at from $1 45 to $1 83 per
    hundred depending on the distance shipped A special fee of 20c per case o f
    100 chicks insures special handling It is estimated that 40 000 will be
    shipped west before the season fin ishes as Mr Lien states that there will

    10th C P i I k M of the smoke but the heat was terrible even in the cold
    running stream The water was nearly warm or heated in places but the fire
    had done its worst so far as we were concerned We had all been saved I could
    see no braves but only a few hundred squaws with their papooses who remained
    in this stream which was not very wide it was filled with all kinds of wild
    animals squaws and papooses Now I may as well in this chapter tell the
    reason why an Indian warrior is called a brave The art of Indian warfare is
    taught to a male child from the time when he can begin to understand
    anything He is told of the branding which will make him an honor or dishonor
    to his parents and to the tribe This branding must take place when the papoo
    o r1 boy is about eight years old so he is prepared for that ordeal long
    before it takes place I t was usually during November when the first snow
    had come and at the full o f the moon or thereabout a number of old dogs had
    been killed a month or two before and the meat roasted over a fire and p ut
    away fo r the feast to follow the branding Ju st after sunset on that day
    two fires are made about 20 or 30 feet apart A brave is then stationed at
    each fire with a long pole with some kind of inflammable dried moss tied to
    one end of the pole which holds a red blaze for a long time The boys to be
    branded are all perfectly naked and are in a tepee nearby One by one they
    must pass between the two fires and will be branded on one hip I f this boy
    will be brave he must walk and not run even when the red fire burns his skin
    I f he lifts up the burned limb or tried to run or gives a yell he is
    branded twice and is an outcast He will never again be allowed to live with
    his parents but is sent away to live among other outcasts and it is the
    greatest dishonor for parents to have a boy an outcast But you would be
    astonished how few o f those little fellows were outcasts and had to be
    branded twice possibly one out o f fifty or less A t the first branding I
    ever had to witness one little fellow lifted up his burned limb and gave the
    yell and he was caught and branded on the other hip and was declared an
    outcast I do not remember but two more at subsequent brandings Soon as the
    branding was over each boy or now a brave was properly attend ed to and the
    burned scars soon healed or at least the pain from it relieved On that same
    evening the dog dance takes place which is the greatest feast o f the season
    A large chunk of the dog meat was hung on a string up just high enough for a
    boy to jump then smaller pieces were hung up higher for older braves The
    dance had music to it but it was made by the voices and shrieks of the
    squaws I t was about the same as the war dance with the exception they were
    not to become excited but were to catch the dog meat in their mouths Soon as
    one would catch his chunk he was a full fledged brave and could talk to
    braves and in fact was as if he had performed a great feat And what an honor
    to his family! Now he would have to do nothing only practice with his bow
    and arrow A t the next fu ll moon he would be paired to some young squaw but
    would not be allowed to live with her until eight years after the branding
    We would not know to whom he was mated until the time of this marriage or
    privilege to live together The young brave must not carry wood for the fire
    nor assist his mother in any way That must be done by his sisters or younger
    brothers A fter the dance is over and meat consumed the pipe o f peace was
    smoked which consisted of a pipe having stone for a bowl and a wooden stem
    to it about two feet long I t was lighted by our medicine man who after
    taking a long pull and whiff passed it to the left o f the circle until all
    had taken a p u ff at it when it would be passed again and again around the
    circle The old medicine man his squaw and myself really enjoyed that feast
    as it seemed to bind us closer together knowing or at least thinking that it
    had the approval o f our Great Spirit That also was to us a real religious
    feast b u t the poor families whose boy had become an outcast had no part in
    this feast and had the same effect as if he had died In fact they would
    rather he had died than to disgrace them and the tribe as well The only way
    an outcast could ever be redeemed was to bring in scalps from an enemy or be
    killed in war for his tribe The outcasts lived by themselves and had
    absolutely nothing in common with the braves They usually became scattered
    bands and mingled with the whites and were a bad lot and there is where the
    real bad Indians came from and several married whites and sickly h a lf
    breed nations were the result Just across the river from where we were was a
    small scattered band o f part o f the black foot tribe that gave us
    considerable trouble and we hated them on account of their stealing from the
    whites for which we would be blamed They took whole droves o f horses and
    even cattle and never or hardly ever took a scalp so we counted them worse
    than outcasts and with them we fought often Several o f our ponies were
    driven over to their camp on one occasion but were retaken only a few days
    later Then it was that we had the one man war with them and it made
    amusement and pastime for several months I t was probably in the spring of
    1870 when every morning a brave from each side would set out in a canoe and
    fight in the center of the river and the one who killed his antagonist that
    side was the victor for that day We had a great many outcasts that were
    anxious for redemption and each day several presented themselves as a
    sacrifice I f he won the victory he was redeemed and i f he was killed he
    was redeemed also and would go to the happy place So it was rejoicing with
    us every day and sometimes a funeral for just as soon as one was killed he
    was fished out o f the water and buried on that same day There was only one
    fight a day and all o f us who were able were on the bank o f the stream at
    sunrise to see the fun The only weapon allowed in the one man war was a
    stone tomahawk so sometimes it took quite a while before one or the other
    was h it and thrown overboard by the victor The woods would BIGGAR S Saunmd
