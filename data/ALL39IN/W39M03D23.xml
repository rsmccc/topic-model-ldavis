NUMBER 19
Senate Repeals WDA Aid
The Wisconsin senate this week
completed action on the WDA repeal
bill by concurring with the assembly
on a measure introduced by Assemblyman
Budlong of Marinette. The
bill was concurred in by the senate
without debate. The week before, the
senate had put in an all-night session
while Progressives filibustered in vain
to save the state appropriation for
this semi-public commission.
The Wisconsin Development Authority
is a non-profit corporation designed
to aid and advise municipally owned
utilities and farm electric cooperatives.
It was scheduled to receive
f>0,000 from the state general fund.
The Budlong repeal bill cannot abolish
WDA because it is a corporation;
however, the repeal of the appropriation
will seriously hamper its functions.
WDA To Continue
Despite the fact that the legislature
has voted to repeal the WDA, John
A. Becker, general manager, insists
that WDA will continue to function
and that “WDA is here to stay/’
In a statement issued after the senate
had passed the repeal bill Becker
said, “It goes without saying that the
legislative measure repealing W D A ’s
state appropriation will seriously hamper
not only the governmental rural
program which has been carried on so
successfully in Wisconsin during the
last three and one-half years, but it
will also retard public and cooperative
ownership.” (Opponents of the WDA
claim that rural electrification will
continue. They point out that REA
existed before the WDA and will continue
after it. They further declare
that other states Jiave rural electric
programs without a WDA.)
Mr. Becker further stated that a
good part of the educational work and
research work of the WDA now under
way would have to be curtailed for the
time being.
“The WDA is definitely here to
stay. Any profits will be plowed back
into research studies in the power
field, into dissemination of the results
of that research and into the educational
and promotional service for
rural electric cooperatives, municipal
plants and other non-profit pjwer
agencies,” Mr. Becker said.
A New REA Division
A few hours after the senate had
denied the WDA state support by
withdrawing the appropriation by action
of the Budlong repeal bill, legislators
gathered in a hearing room to
discuss the merits of a plan by four
Republican assemblymen to establish
a rural electrification division in the
department of agriculture and markets
with a 15,000 annual state ap propriation.
Speaker of the assembly, Vernon
Thompson, Richland Center, one of the
authors of the bill stated that he had
limited the powers of the new division
to the scope allowed by the state
supreme court in its second decision
on the validity of the WDA. He said
its chief function would be that of providing
information for newly formed
cooperatives.
According to Thompson the new division
would also be a clearing house
for ideas as experienced by the various
rural electric cooperatives now in
the state. Purpose of placing the bill
under the department of agriculture
and markets is to keep the division as
far removed from politics as is possible.
John A. Becker, WDA manager,
heartily endorsed the bill and urged
quick action on the bill so that it could
assume activities that the WDA will
be forced to drop.
Others sponsoring the bill are Assemblymen
Walter Cook, Clark county;
Guy Benson, Spooner; and David
Hammergron, Cochrane; all Republicans.
School Bus Safety
and exhaust pipe extending to the
rear of the bus.
Buses would have to be equipped
with a hot water heater, fire extinguisher,
emergency first aid kit, adequate
brakes, two red flags and three
flares for emergencies, and two rear
vision mirrors. “ School Bus” in
black letters at least nine inches high
would be displayed on a yellow background.
Henry Berquist, Progressive, has
introduced a bill requiring school
buses to stop at railroad crossings;
and Herbert Schenk, Progressive, is

SCHOOL NEWS
University of Wisconsin Report
A report on the first semester work .
of Wittenberg high school graduates
reached the principal’s office last
week. It shows that the eight students
enrolled have made the grade with
better than average marks. The University
freshman students are Phyllis
Anderson, June Buman, Robert Gowell,
Irenus Hoekstra, Melitta Kersten,
James Meisner, Irvin Wege and Raymond
Welder, Their averages for the
semester ranged from 86-95. The
University finds it necessary to send
home a large number of students each
year because they have not maintained
the high standards that must be set
up by a university. It is very gratifying
to learn that Wittenberg with
an unusually large representation from
the class of 1938 has suffered no
casualties this year.
Spring Vacation
School will close on Friday, March
31, and after one week vacation will
reopen Monday, April 10.
News As Quoted by the
Kindergartners
Our garden is growing a little bit.
Our radishes, lettuce and carrots are
up. The corn is not coming up yet.
We water the garden every morning.
We have some little bunnies in our
sand table and some little chickens
and some Easter eggs. We made them
of colored paper.
We went for a walk. We looked at
the buds on the trees, and the grass.
Every boy and girl is here today.
Forensic Contest Monday
The local forensic contest will be
held in the high school assembly room
Monday evening at eight o’clock.
Students will compete in Declamation

In te rn a tio n a l
Since last autum n’s Munich conference
the U. S. has popped in and
out from internationalism to isolation,
occasionally sticking its political
neck into affairs where many
people thought it had no business.
Samples: Secretary of the Interior
Harold Ickes’ tirades against the
Nazis, contrasted with congress’ reticence
to approve U. S. arms sale
to European democracies. The apparent
sum total of this vaccilating
foreign policy has been confusion,
yet there is good evidence that U. S.
pro-democracy pressure has exerted
enough international influence to
swing the world from war to peace.
Most definite U. S. aid has been
the sale of airplanes to France and
Britain, allowing those nations to
change their armies overnight from
weak, cowering units to potent
forces which neither Hitler nor Mussolini
dared trifle with.
But a more positive U. S. aid has
been the moral support tendered
France and Britain via both direct
statement and round-about action.
Not confirmed, but well authenticated,
is the report that President
Roosevelt injected a sedative into
jittery France and Britain by advising
those chancellories to resist
any new Rome-Berlin demands.
Since foreign trade is an important
weapon of the 1939 model aggressor,
the U. S. inflicted its deepest wound
in German-Italian ambitions by form
ulating an important trade and
credit pact with Brazil, largest and
most important of the much-coveted
South American nations.
Though many countries (like Argentina,
Chile and Peru) have accepted
totalitarian trade gestures,
the U. S.-Brazilian pact politely
hints that it would not be wise for
South American nations to become
too entangled with Europe. Moreover
the pact gives Brazil enough
financial encouragement to make
her tomorrow s No. 1 South American
nation, whose example her
neighbors will be w-ise to follow.
Gist of the pact: In return for Brazilian
thawing out of frozen American
credits and resumption of payments
on Brazilian bonds held here,
the U. S. will place 69,000,000 in
credits at Brazil’s disposal, also
m aking other efforts to stimulate
the country’s industrial output and
her trade with the U. S.
How these developments have
strengthened the European backbone
is immediately apparent.
Great Britain has defied Nationalist
S p a in s blockade of the Loyalist
coastline, risking a major incident
by sending two destroyers to rescue
a British freighter which had been
seized by Generalissimo Francisco
F ranco’s warships Britain has
pledged her aid to France against
Mediterranean territorial demands
by Italy. But most important, London
has regained her confidence to
the point of making public recommendation
that Europe's flve powers
(France, Britain, Italy, G e rm any
and Russia) vow a five-year
s i r s a m i :e l i i o a r e
He idealized, but nobody listened.
peace. The proposal, as voiced by
Home Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare:
“ Suppose in the space of five years
there were neither wars nor rumors
of wars, and suppose the peoples
of Europe were able to free
themselves of the nightmares that
h aunt them and from the expenditures
that beggar them? Here, indeed,
is the greatest opportunity
ever offered to leaders of the
world.”
Sir Samuel explained that Europe’s
big five would be “ blessed
in their efforts by the President of
the United States,” but the Washington
that inspired his outburst was
less eager to endorse it. Recalled
was Secretary of State Cordell H ull’s
statement of February 13, to the effect
that the time is not yet ripe for
d isarm am e nt talk.
Italians commented the plan was
“ so vague it is not worth considering
.M Germ any grumbled about the
lack of “ tangible proposals,’* and
within 24 hours something else had
happened to blow Sir Sam uel’s idealistic
plan to kingdom come:
Czecho-vs.-Slovakia. Traditional
bad blood between Czechs and Slovaks
has been hidden under the
m antle of Czechoslovakia's democracy
for 20 years. Last autumn,
when Germany grabbed Sudetenland
and humbled the Prague government,
autonomy moves started in
Slovakia (central province) and R uthenia
(far eastern province). Hungary
and Poland wanted to grab off
Slovakia or Ruthenia, or both, thereby
gaining a common frontier. H itler
objected because Czechoslovakia
was now his path to the east from
which may some day start a pan-
Ukraine movement.
Recognizing in Germany a common
danger, Poland, Czechoslovakia
and Hungary have grow-n more independent
of late, while Hitler has
speeded autonomy agitation in both
Slovakia and Ruthenia, now renamed
Carpatho-Ukraine. Finally
becoming desperate and spunky,
Prague purged pro-Nazi officials in
Carpatho-Ukraine, following this a
few days later by ousting Slovakia’s
priest-premier, Dr. Joseph Tiso. The
allegation: That Dr. Tiso was consorting
with Berlin, which turned out
to be an obvious fact when the premier
began sending secret messages
to Adolf Hitler.
Though the new Czech crisis was
apparently settled a few days later
by appointment of moderate Carl
D R . JO S E P H TISO
Agpnt of a new cause celeb re?
Sidor as Slovak premier, the terrific
implications of German intervention
were soon realized. Berlin’s press
wept for the Slovaks just as it wept
for the Austrians and Sudetens last
year. Like an earlier “ fuehrer”
named Konrad Henlein (champion
of the Sudetens) Dr. Tiso flew to
Germany for consultation while his
aides made fiery pro-Nazi speeches.
Finally, on the first anniversary
of A ustria’s downfall, Germany ordered
Czechoslovakia sliced into
three “ independent” states—Bohemia,
Slovakia and Carpatho-
Ukraine. Though each state was to
decide for itself whether this indedependence
was desired, there remained
little doubt but that Nazi
pressure would bring a favorable decision.
As a result Der Fuehrer
cleared the way for his drive into
the Ukraine, replacing one strong
nation with three weak ones. Moreover,
since the Reich now lords it
over Bohemia, Slovakia and Carpatho-
Ukraine. there is no hope that
Poland or Hungary will block the
Ukrainian drive by swallowing one
of these states.
Such developments made Europe
forget Sir Samuel Hoare's peace
plan. But what Europe could not
forget is that both Britain and
France agreed to guarantee Czechoslovakia's
new boundaries after the
Munich conference, a guarantee
which has now been ignored. Whereas
but a few weeks ago London and
Paris claimed to have regained their
strength and abandoned the “ appeasement”
policy, it is now evident
that no such thing has happened.

The new, 62-year-old papal secretary
of state is a lifelong friend
and one-time classmate of the
former Eugenio Cardinal Pacelii,

elevated to the
post of Pope Pius
X II. Ordained in
1901 in his native
Italy, Cardinal
Maglione im m e diately
entered
the V atican’s diplomatic
service,
going to Switzerland
in 1918 and
to Palestine in
1920 as archbishop of Caosaria.
His first nunciature was in Switzerland
but it was in France that
he gained such appreciation that
he w'on the Grand Cross of the
Legion of Honor. In 1935, when
created a cardinal, he received
his biretta from the hands of the
French president. Since then he
has been in Rome as head of the
congregation of the council. His

From mid-May to mid-June. Great
B ritain’s King George and Queen
Elizabeth will be guests of the North
American continent on a junket
which most good Americans regard
as a simple, friendly gesture. But
as travel time approaches, the royal
expedition is meeting with far more
distracting bogeymen than Toron
to's Dionne quintuplets, which are
being shipped 180 miles under protest
to curtsy before their queen.
From June 8 to 11 the royal party
will visit the U. S. Because the
entire journey was planned last winter
in ths heat of international chatter
about “ democratic solidarity,”
more than one anti-Chamberlain
writer has tried to place the prime
minister in a difficult position. A
sample, by one Peter Howard in
Lord Beaverbrook’s Daily Express:
“ Now the royal visit puts Chamberlain
himself on trial. If it succeeds
Chamberlain goes up. If it fails he
goes down.”
What Englishmen mean by “ success”
o r ‘“ failure” of the American
visit was finally brought into fairly
close focus, but it still remained a
doubtful quantity. Probable meaning:
The visit will “ fa il” if U. S.
citizens get the impression that King
George and Queen Elizabeth are
making a begging expedition to gain
American aid in pulling England’s
chestnuts out of the European fires.

economy drive in congress which
Sen. P at Harrison, chairm an of the
senate finance committee, is predicting
matures, it very conceivably

and Hopkins are counting most. It
was to get the wheels turning in this
particular line that the surprise settlements
were made by TVA with
first Chattanooga and then M em phis.
The object was to start p rivate
utility spending—^which piled up
4,000,000,000 of needed investment
that C h airm an W. O. Douglas, of
S. E. C., has been harping on in
conversations with the President
and Hopkins.
But look what was going on even
while the olive branches were being
waved, even while several million
dollars more was agreed upon than
need have been paid the Commonwealth
  Southern and the Electric
Bond   Share if the original Lilienthal-
Wilhoite-Rankin ideas had been
carried out.
First, every ouiue of adm inistration
pressure possible was exerted
to force the appropriation of money
by congress not only to complete
the Gilbertsville d am , already started,
but the Watts Bar d am as well.
Second, the report of Chief E ng ineer
Panter. of the special congressional
committee which has been investigating
TVA, was suppressed
during these maneuvers to get the
full amount of TVA appropriations
desired.
Investigation Obviously
Intended as a U hitewash
No attention was paid to this last
by the daily newspapers, which long
since lost interest in an investigation
so obviously intended to be
nothing but a whitewash. But surely
no one directing this strategem
thought that the private utilities
would not know about it—especially
when the active Republican m em bers
of the committee knew that the
report had been submitted, that it
was in the hands of Vic Donahey,
chairm an of the committee, and that
a copy of it was in the hands of
Francis Biddle, counsel in chief on
the whitewashing job, who had been
rewarded by the White House with
a federal judgeship!
The really perplexing part of all
this is that critics of TVA, knowing
the opinion of Engineer Tom P a n ter
given the committee publicly by
Arthur E. Morgan, deposed chairm
an of TVA, in protest against Panter’s
appointment, do not think for
a moment that the Panter report
will be anything but favorable to
TVA. They suspect that there m ay
be some little point in the report,
however, on which administration
leaders figured TVA critics might
be able to make capital. And when
it is considered that the change of
h alf a dozen votes in the house
would have stopped the building of
Watts B;ir dam the point m igh t really
have been very important.
Two things, if they could be definitely
promised with assurance that
the promises would be kept, would
beyond the slightest doubt cause a
construction spree by the electric
industry, which m ight easily produce
thc wave of prosperity for
which Roosevelt and Hopkins hope.
One would be that the government
would construct no more hydroelectric
projects. The other would be
that the government would make
no more free grants and cheap interest
loans for construction of local
electric systems. In short, a
promise of no more subsidized government
competition.
Question of Tax Boosts
Certain lo Be Considered
Despite all the promise* about no
tax increases there is very likely to
be considerable serious discussion of
tax boosts before the present session
congress adjourns. Anything else
will run the government into a situation
which no administration likes
to face during a presidential cam paign
year, which of course is what
next year will be.
First let's look at the attitude of
congress. The house, one day when
a lot of Democrats were not around,
voted to cut some 17,000,000 out of
the TVA appropriation. The senate
restored the cuts. The house conferees
yielded to the senate, and
the house then voted 184 to 174 to
spend the money. Close, yes, but
plenty.
Take another sample, the silver
policy. Administration critics attack
it as perhaps the most foolish thing
the government is doing, from an
economic standpoint—though some
experts contend nothing compares
with what the government has done
about cotton. The silver policy is
divided in two parts, paying a subsidy
of more than 20 cents an ounce
on all silver mined inside the United
States, and buying silver from foreign
countries.
Minority members a few days ago
forced a vote on an amendment to
the bill in the house, which would
have eliminated the buying of silver
from abroad, but would have left
the domestic subsidy. But even this
failed. The vote was 155 to 135
against the proposed economy.
While Expenditures Mounted
Receipts Materially Hropptd
Now let’s take a look at the treasury
situation, in view of this evident
prospect that congress is not going
to reduce expenditures. The latest
figures available as this is written
are for the fiscal year, which began
Ju ly 1, last, up to the end of the day
on February 27* Expenses for -this
year—referring to this period and
not the full year of course—were
5,867,219.5-19 as compared with 4,-
764,910,658 for the corresponding period
of last year. Receipts, however,
were 3,645,500,234 for this
year, and 3.844,461,038 for last year.
So that while expenditures mounted
by more than 1,110,000,000 receipts
fell off by about 200,000,000.
So that for practically two-thirds
of the fiscal year we are now passing
through the treasury is about
1,300,000,000 worse off than for the
comparable period of the last fiscal
year!
As this is reflected in debt and
foreshadows what is going to happen
to this government along that line,
it might be of interest to say that
figures for the same day—the close
of business on February 27 of this
year—show that the public debt of
Uncle Sam was 39,850,479,573.22.
This had risen from 37,631,168,041.19
on February 27, 1938.
Shou s If hy Britain Wanted
Franco lo Win in Spain
The answer to why the British
foreign office has consistently wanted
Franco to win in Spain, despite
the fact that obvipusly such a victory
would increase not only the
power but the prestige of Ita ly and
Germ any, is very clear, once stated,
whether one agrees with the logic
dictating it or not. Indeed the fact
that it is the Berlin-Rome axis that
keeps British statesmen awake at
night—a fact which on the surface
would seem to create a desire in
Downing street for a crushing defeat
of Franco—is an integral part
of the reason for wanting Franco to
win.
The logic behind this is also the
logic which has caused President
Roosevelt and Secretary of State
Cordell H ull to be deaf to the pleas
of the liberals in this country. And
believe it or not, hatred of com m u nism
here and fear of the bear that
walks like a m an in England has
precisely nothing to do with it!
Simply stated, this mystifying logic
revolves around the route from
England to In d ia and the East, via
the Mediterranean sea. I f you will
take a good look at any fa ir scaled
m a p of the Mediterranean, you will
see why. Look at the narrow passage
between the tip of Sicily and
the projecting point of Tunis, in
North Africa. Every ship going
from England to India, East Africa
or the F a r East must traverse that
narrow strait, or else the still sm a ller
passage between Sicily and the
m ainland of Italy.
Before the days of the World war
this did not seem important. The
Italians m ight speak of the Mediterranean
as Mare Nostrum, but the
British controlled both entrances,
G ib raltar and the Suez canal. But
with the World war came the realization
of the m ilitary importance
of the submarine and the airplane—
and of floating mine fields. Prior
to that time the British navy could
assure control of the surface of the
sea, and therefore of free passage
for her merchant vessels and those
of any other nation to which she
m igh t choose to grant passage.
So (.real Britain Had
To Hr Friendly Wilh Italy
So the British made up their
m inds that, come what m ay , they
would simply have to be friendly
with Italy. Little as they m igh t like
the new attitude in that country,
the conquest of Ethiopia, obvious aspirations
in Africa which threatened
British interests in that continent,
they figured they would have to put
up with it.
If you will consider the strategic
location of the little Ita lia n island
of Pantelleria, just beyond the narrow
passage between Sicily and Tunis,
and figure in terms of subm arines,
airplanes and mines, you will
begin to wonder if maybe the British
are not right after all.
Reconciled to this, the British
have turned their energies, in the
last few years, to cultivating F ran co.
They have convinced themselves,
and the Washington adm inistration,
that they have done a
good job at this: that with the comj
ing of peace Spam would find that
I England, not Italy, is the marked
, for its exports.

BT ELIZABETH JORDAN
CH A PT E R VU
—IS—
Hale had no desire to linger in
New York. The weather was still
torrid and he thought longingly of
the wash of the waves on the beach
beyond his windows at Halcyon
Camp.
On Friday he gave his attention to
• few odds and ends. That noon he
lunched comfortably at the E ngineers'
Club; and he took an early
afternoon train for Long Island. He
was ready for Ainsworth now, but
he had no intention of rushing the
conference with him.
H ale’s plan was to see Joan as
soon as he returned and persuade
her to go out in the motor-boat or
take a walk in the woods. His statement
of the Craig affair had been
form ally prepared, with the aid of
Mr. Phelps, and impressively typewritten
in that gentleman’s office.
It would be wise to have the signatures
added to it while the memory
of Craig's activities was still green
at Halcyon Camp.
But Jo a n was not to be seen when
he reached there. Indeed, every
member of the group was apparently
taking a siesta except Mrs. Spencer
Forbes. She was stretched out
on the couch hammock on the front
porch, which was now in the shade,
and she held a magazine upside
down. She welcomed Rex with flattering
warmth. He sat down on the
ham m ock beside her.
" I never closed m y eyes last
night,” she announced.
Somewhat wearily young Mr.
Hale went into action, and assured
her that such eyes should never be
closed.
“ I was thinking of you,” she continued.
“ Of course you were. You have a
sympathetic heart. You realized
what our hours of separation meant
to m * .”
For once Mrs. Spencer Forbes refused
an invitation to play verbal
ping pong. •
“ All I realized,” she explained
crisply, " is that in some way you’ve
got n d of Craig. I want to know
how you did it. I can't breathe
deeply until I do know.”
"Y o u know why I got rid of him,
don't you?”
“ I can imagine it, without any
■train.”
“ You knew exactly what was going
on, d idn’t you?”
''Yes, I suppose I did. It seemed
so incredible that I couldn't be quite
sure I was right.”
“ You knew,” Hale said firmly.
‘ ‘You and Ainsworth must have
caught on very early in the action.
Yet you'd have let it go on, without
lifting a hand to stop it, till young
Kneeland cracked. Lady, the discovery
has been a blow to me.
Where’s the big womanly heart I've
been trying to win? Your motto ia
‘Live and let live,' isn’t it? ”
"N o, it’s even stronger than that,
my friend.” Her strange eyes met
his with an odd expression. She
added deliberately, "M y motto is
‘Die and let die.' ”
He nodded.
"A ll right. That's the way you
feel. You adm it that you know,
and have known for weeks, perhaps
for months, what Craig was trying
to do to young Kneeland. You've
known, haven't you?”
" I think so. A good prosecuting
attorney was certainly lost in you,
Rex. 1 rather like it,” she added
cheerfully. “ I enjoy seeing you filled
with such righteous wrath that your
eyes take fire and your red hair
stands on end. Now be a good boy
and tell Aunty how you got rid of
C raig.”
" I t was easy. I told him the
game was up. I told him I'd start
proceedings to have his license revoked
if he didn’t clear out. Naturally,
he cleared. That reminds me
I've got the complaint here, to be
signed by us all as witnesses. It
will never be used unless he makes
more trouble. Arc you altruistic
enough to sign it? ”
She shrugged.
“ I suppose so. I wouldn't care to
appear in such a proceeding, but
of course he'll see that it never
comes up. That's one of the things
a doctor can't risk. Now, what are
you frowning over?”
" I ’m frowning because I can’t
make myself believe even yet that
you would reaMv have sat through
the summer and watched that
devil drive that boy ofT his head
without raising a hand to help h im .”
Mrs. Spencer Forbes looked patient.
“ You’re beginning to bore me,
Rex,” she assured him , “ but I'll
play with you ■ little longer. You
m ustn’t be so sentimental. Herbert
Kneeland isn’t a boy. He’s s man
twenty-two years old. But he’s a
weakling, and I haven't much use
for weaklings. Let's change the subject.
I suppose," she added briskly,
"y o u ’re going after Ainsworth
now."
“ I certainly am .”
She fingered her magazine.
“ I know Ainsworth hus Casper
Kneeland by the short hairs," she
m urm ured. " I don't know how he
got the grip. I suppose it's a mat-
U r of b lackm ail?”
"N o t exactly. By the way, I met
a friend of yours in New York the
other d ay .”
Her lips curled.
"Y o u would. They swarm around
me. Which of the multitude was
this?”
“ George Stuyvesant. Like Ainsworth,
he was a classmate of mine
at Cornell."
Her cold face warmed a trifle.
“ George is a nice boy,” she testified,
"a n d Honore is one of m y best
friends. I don’t go in much for the
softer emotions, but I get quite mellow
when I think of George and his
mother.”
" I asked h im what there was
about you that I didn’t understand,”
Hale grinned. "H e told me to ask
you. He said you would certainly
tell m e .”
Her face hardened again.
“ I ’m not sure I ’ll do anything of
the sort," she said curtly. " I don’t
see why I shouldn’t have a few feminine
reserves, even if you have
lived in Spain and learned some
Spanish love songs. However, sing
“ Yes, I ’ll sign, since the show is
over.”
She wrote her negligent scrawl
under Kneeland’a name, made >
blot, swore m ildly, and handed back
the pen and the statement. Then
she looked up at the young man
with a malicious light in her eyes.
" I shouldn’t have said that I was
bored this afternoon," she suddenly
admitted. “ I was interested. I am
still. I ’m very much interested."
Rex folded the complaint and put
it in his pocket.
“ Something warns me this is not
a com p lim e nt," he admitted. "W h at
interests yo u ?"
Mrs. Spencer Forbes shook her
head. Her eyes had in them the
flickering lights of a pale atar sapphire.
"Y o u r m yopia,” she said sweetly.
"M y m yopia?” Rex was mystified.
“ Yes. You think you’re seeing
very clearly. You think you’re seeing

She looked warm and tired but her
face brightened when she saw him.
"W h a t you need," he said promptly,
"is a cool swim before tea. Get
your bathing suit and come along."
"W h at a masterful young m an It

"W h a t would you do to me if I
d id n ’t obey?”
“ Toss you from here to the beach
with one easy, graceful swing.”
“ That wouldn't be so bad. I ’ve
walked all I want to, and the woods
were hot. However, go on, Signor
Mussolini. I will join you on the
beach.”
“ I ’ll wait here till you come, and
carry your bathing suit. Something
warns me you would sag under the
weight of it."
His eyes were anxious as they
followed her. She looked " a ll in.”
The discovery had an extraordinary
effect on him . It puzzled and depressed
him , to a surprising degree.
It filled h im with a conviction

them to me tonight and I ’ll probably
babble all you want to know.”
Hale met her eyes squarely.
“ I don’t need to,” he told her in
a low voice. “ I know, now.”
She could not be said to change
color. Her color never changed. But
her expression became harder and
very watchful. She spoke, however,
as lightly as before.
“ My life is an open book. Who
directed your attention to Chapter
T hirteen?"
“ A most unpleasant person who
answers to the name of J im Haines.
I kicked him out of the woods back
of here the other day.”
She frowned.
"Now, you really are becoming
annoying," she said sharply. “ I
don’t allow any interference whatever
with my private affairs. Please
remember that. If you’ve kicked
J im Haines out of this neighborhood
kindly kick him back again,
and be quick about it."
Hale kept his eyes on hers.
“ You don’t really want h im ," he
said gently. “ Confess that you
don’t. You’re too level-headed. Why
should you play with hell-flre? And
why the devil should you drag poor
Miss Hosanna into it? ”
Mrs. Spencer Forbes sat up very
straight and faced him with a complete
change of expression.
"Now, see here, m y la d ," she said
incisively, “ this isn’t amusing any
more. Surely you’re not fool enough
to believe that Hosanna Kneeland
ever—”
"No, I ’m not and I don’t. I want
her to stay as she is. Tell m s
something. Is there any really norm
a l human being at Halcyon Camp,
aside from Miss Hosanna and Joan
and rre?”
Mrs. Spencer Forbes sent him an
odd little smile.
“ Normal human beings are horribly
d u ll,” she observed. “ I haven't
much use for them myself.”
Hale got up abruptly.
" I think I'll have a swim before
te a ," he announced. "Where is everybody,
anyhow?”
Mrs. Spencer Forbe.1 laughed.
“ They’re all having their beauty
sleep except Bert. He has gone
out in his boat with the Nash
Cub. The others won’t be down for
an hour. You'll have plenty of time
for a swim. I ’d go with y o u ; but I ’m
all freshly enameled in preparation
for your return, and I'd crack. I
don't m ind adding," she ended depressedly,
"th a t you've been a sad
disappointment to me this afternoon."
"B u ry the memory of it under a

papers and his fountain pen. "Sign
this. Right here, under Uncle C a » j’
name. He signed last night."
erick Ainsworth you have been
blind as a bat to something more
important than either of them. It
has been going on right under your
eyes. I ’ve been watching it for two
months. It is developing quite fast.
But you, m y little Star of Bethlehem,
you who have been lighting
up all our dark corners, haven't the
least suspicion of it. You're as blind
as the proverbial b at."
Hale took a quick turn around the
room and then walked back to her.
"B e a good sport," he urged. “ Tell
me what you’re driving at.”
"Not for the wealth of Ormus and
of In d ," she quoted. ‘That would
be a flat contradiction of all my theories.
I'm the innocent bystander
in this matter. I'm going to keep
on being that. Pleasant reflections
in the water, O Star of Bethlehem!”
Hale hurried off to his room to get
his bathing suit. He was deeply
disturbed. He had developed no
faith at all in Mrs. Spencer Forbes
during their association. But he had
a strong impression that for once,
at least, she was really saying
something.
His mind was full of this surprising
theory when he descended the
front steps with his bathing suit over
it at once. Why should a girl with
youth, beauty, money, gnd the figure
of a young Amazon go about
looking like the last survivor of ■
Greek tragedy?
S h f came down almost at once.
"That must weigh all of two
ounces.” she jibed as he took the
bathing suit from her. She added
without giving him time to reply,
"B e rt told me what you had done
for h im ."
"D id you realize what was going
o n?”
She stopped short to stare at him.
"W h at a question,” she brought
out indignantly. “ Do you think I'd
have let it continue another minute
if I had? I saw that Bert was losing
ground all the time, and that Doctor
Craig wasn't helping him. I thought
it was wholly a case of nerves.
I didn't dare to interfere. Doctor
Craig has been his closest friend.
I ’m sure I'd have caught on to it
long ago, except that we all seemed
to be under the harrow. Whichever
way I looked there was something—
something—well, depressing is the
mildest word for it. I thought it was
m y own condition. I thought I was
imagining things. But thank God
that horror is out of the w ay.”

A v ia t io n P r o f it t one of the main
panjandrums of
the plane designing and building industry.
Just now, the Civil Aeronautics
authority certifies Mr. Fairchild's
new 500-horsepower “ in-line” engine,
which, he says, has more power
for its weight than any other.
For several years, Mr. F airchild has
been pioneering the “ in-line" engines
as against the radial type of
foreign nations. In 1936, he sold 20
of them to the Greek government,
which, it was later reported, found
them highly satisfactory. His engine
is about one-third the size of
a radial engine
His father, the late George W.
Fairchild, began his business
career on 8 a week, invented
the dial telephone, the computing
scale, and the adding ma*
chine. He wanted xhis son lo
become a junior executive of
International Business Machines
corporation. The young man,
however, was interested mainly
in cameras. At 17, he had invented
a revolutionary flashlight
ca.nera, and. at 21, a radial
aerial camera.
He organized Fairchild Aerial
Surveys and in 1924 carried through
an air camera survey of New York,
with a six-mile camera of his invention
which was a pioneering exploit
in that field.
By 1927, he had corraled several
companies in thc Fairchild Aviation
corporation, had Igor Sigorsky building
planes, and soon unveiled the
first cabin monoplane in the United
St-iPS.
In Harvard at the start of tbe
war, he was rejected for m ilitary
service because of physical
shortcomings, later remedied in
Arizona. Intent on war duty of
some kind, he brought out an
aerial camera for war use,
completed just before the A rm istice.
He is typical of a n um ber
of free and adventurous selfstarters
in l Tncle Sam's industrial
and technical establishment
who can be rounded up in case
of trouble—a refutation of the
totalitarian belief that only the
goose-step can yield efficiency.
A River Is Their Memorial
A WAY back in 1739 Pierre and
* * Paul Mallet, Canadian traders,
heard of the wealth of far-away
Santa Fe where, it was said, the
Spanish senors wore silver buttons
on their clothes and the senoritas
had silver heels on their slippers.
So they enlisted six other venturesome
Canadians and after a long
journey by boat and pack train, arrived
in the New Mexican capital.
The Spanish governor was friendly
but there was a law against
free trading. So the Mallets started
north, crossed the headwaters of
the Canadian (called the Colorado
by the Spaniards because of its red
waters) and followed up the Pur-
I gatoire to its junction with the Arkansas
There the party split up.
i Three of the men, who were home-
! sick, started overland for Canada
and eventually reached Montreal
j safely.
The Mallets, accompanied by two
! others, went down the Arkansas and
I the Mississippi to New Orleans,
I where they reported their explorations
to Bienville, the governor,
whose efforts to find a route to San-
J ta Fe had been unsuccessful. He
engaged them to guide another expedition
led by Andre de la Bruyere,
j a royal officer, who was to ascend
| the Mississippi and Arkansas to the
| mouth of the Canadian, which the
I Mallets correctly guessed arose
i “ less than 40 leagues from Santa
! F e ."
When the Canadian dwindled
i away to a mere brook in central
Oklahoma, Bruyere sat down to wait
for it to rise, instead of buying
horses from the Osages to transport
| his goods, as the Mallets advised
him to do. But it was a dry year
and, after waiting six months, Bruyere
went back to New Orleans The
Mallets returned to Canada, where
1 they disappeared from history, but
today the Canadian river is a 760
mile-long memorial to the two
brothers “ whose wanderings rank
I them on a par with La Salle.’*

Draft Colts’ Comeback
Maryland Now
on Farms in
Reality, Shows Reveal
The roar of the motor i i heard in
country as well aa town, but for all
the evidences of the mechanical
age, the fact remaina that draft
colts are kicking today on Maryland's
hillsides, writes Ruth S. Hopkins
in the Baltimore Sun. For the
heavy horse is returning to the
farm . At the latest state and county
fairs, in farmboys' colt clubs, at
sales, officials have noticed greatly
quickened interest in the animal
which had almost been outmoded by
a gas-driven motor and a war.
| The pinch of a national farm prob-
' lem has made more effective the influence
of the University of Maryland
and the Maryland Horae Breeders'
association, which preach the
economic wisdom of using drafter*
to balance farm income with farm
output, and our bluegrass counties’
natural advantages for raising
horses.
Bluegrass country begins in northern
New Jersey, swings down in a
long, gentle curve through Maryland,
the Virginias and Kentucky.
The horses’ own terrain, its lush
pastures and mineral streams become
rich blood and hard, strong
, boo**; its rolling hills develop uie
heart, lungs and muscles of a young
horse. These regions, noted for
thoroughbreds, are as well suited
for drafters.
Obviously, there is a difference between
the horse which over night
makes you a millionaire and the one
which overnight delivers the milk.
B ut one is no poor relation of the
other. Both may be blooded animals—
one "thoroughbred," the other
"p urebred" — both boasting pedigrees
that reach back through generations
of aristocrats.

honey, which is the only tree that

Klondike Kate
j L J E R neighbors in Bend. Ore
I 1 • know her as Mrs. John Matson,
| or "A unt Kate” Matson, but to old
i sourdoughs who mushed over Alas
j kan trails during the gold rush days
| of '98, she always has been and still
i is “ Klondike Kate.” The daughter of
a Seattle judge. Kate Betts spent
j most of her early life in a convent.
Then a reverse in the Betts family
fortune took her from behind its
walls and started her on her career
of adventure.
She was in Seattle when the stam pede
to A[aska started. She joined
the gold rush and finally found herself
in rip-roaring Dawson City.
There she became the belle of the
bars and a favorite of the bearded
| prospectors who came to town eager
| to spend money after their struggles
to gain a fortune from the frozen
soil. They showered their nuggets
upon “ Klondike Kate” —she often
made as much as 150 a night by
| singing and dancing for them. Once
a miner gave her 750 in “ dust”
| simply for the privilege of sitting
and talking to her.
But like many others, she brought
j little of her money back to the
| States with her when the boom days
were over. Finally in 1933 she re
j ceived a letter from 70-year old
j John Matson, who had known her
in the Dawson City days and who
wanted to marry her. The marriage
took place in Vancouver, B C
! Then she settled down in the little
j Oregon city, no longer the fa
mous “ Klondike Kate,” the toast of
Alaskan gold camps, but “ Aunt

First Into Antarctic
T H E Y tell tall tales of explora
tions in the Antarctic. Non* ol
them can compare, though, with the
i trip of Nathanial B Palmer if sheer
adventure ia the standard. Away
back in 1820 he was the flrst voyag
er to reach the northern fringe of
the Antarctic continent.
A tall, blonde. Connecticut Yankee,
Nat Palm er waa atill only in
his teens when he made the voyage
as skipper of the sloop Hero.
The ship which penetrated farther
south than any other up until that
time was only 50 feet long—half the
size of the sailboat "A m e ric a ,” original
winner of the flrst America's
Cup race In 1851.
The voyage is more remarkable,
too, when you consider that it was
made almost 100 years before the
poles were finally reached.
Palmer himself has said, "1 pointed
the bow of the little craft to the
south’ard and, with her wings
spread, mainsail abeam, jib abreast
the opposite bow, she speeded on
her way to new sealing ground like a

How About Your Safety?

about your safety?
The National Safety council reports
that from the age of three
years to 21, accidents kill more

from the age of three years

Among males of all ages only
heart disease claims more victims
than accidents—301.6 of every

Reduce Rural School Aida?
Rural schools with 10 or fewer
pupils will face reductions in state
aids, unless keeping them open is practical,
if identical bills before the state
senate and assembly become law.
There are nearly 700 rural schools
serving 10 or fewer pupils in the
state, assistant state superintendent
of public instruction, Victor E. Kimball,
ha* informed the assembly education
committee. Many of the schools
he said, are being kept open because
of the state and county aid and because
they provide teaching jobs, or
fuel business for school officials’ relatives.
The bills would allow the state
superintendent of public instruction
to deny the schools the 250 per tea
cher aids ordinarily available, and
would instead allow only 25 per pupil
Counties in levying school taxes would
be held down to a 's im ila r allowance
for the small schools.
The bills are designed to save tht
state from 200,000 to 250,000 by
forcing such small schools to close and
making the district provide transportation
to bigger schools nearby. The
small schools in sparsely settled areas
however, would be protected because
the state superintendent of public instruction
could grant the aid when
transportation toother districts proved
impractical.
Livestock Shipping Rates
Seeking to maintain for Wisconsin
farmers the present 15'- deduction on
freight rates of “stocker and feeder”
livestock shipping, the Wisconsin publie
service commission through its.
transportation director, Philip H.
Porter, has filed a brief with the inter- j
state commerce commission protesting
proposed changes which would increase
those rates.
The railroads propose to grant this;
15 per cent reduction on shipments of I
livestock to the farm only after thej
farmer files a claim with proof that
the fattened livestock were shipped to
the stockyards by rail.
Present 15 per cent reduction rates
to and from the farm have been in
operation on “stocker and feeder” livestock
for more than 50 years. Mr.
Porter contends that loss of this rate
reduction would make it impossible
foi the Wisconsin farmer to continue
in the livestock fattening business.
In his brief, Porter points out that
many of Wisconsin’s 175.000 farms
scattered throughout the length and
breadth of the state purchase livestock
in small quantities for feeding,
fattening and reshipping to market.
This business is generally supplemental
to their regular farm operations
and is not the main business of these
farms.

Some time ago we read of one Mr.

1. Is Mr. Ryder the father or mother

2. Does fhe chick feel any devotion

A friend of mine told me recently
that a friend of his told him of a
friend who had been reprimanded by
the priest for eating hamburger during
Lent. Shortly thereafter the
Father, needing some wood, ordered
i load from his hamburger-eating
parishioner. So this friend of a friend
of mine drove up to the Father’s
house and dumped a load of sawdust
into his yard.
"W’hat is the meaning of th is ? ”
shouted the angry priest. “ I ordered
a load of wood!”
" I f hamburger is meat.” said the
parishioner calmly, “ this is wood."

A flea and a fly in a flue
To each other said, “W’hat shall we
d o ? ”
“ Let us flee,” said the fly.
“ Let us fly,” said the flea.
So they flew through a flaw in the
flue.*
But that’s not the kind of “flu ” that
caught you, is it, dear Editor?

The average life of apple trees in
Wisconsin is generally estimated at
40 years, although in some areas and
on some soils, it is as low as 15 years.
It is believed that with care, these
orchards can last for a much longer
period.
Marble playing youths are as typical
of spring in 1939 as sulphur and

Give Flowers a Break
r ) O N 'T put an added burden on
your flowers by asking them
to grow in conditions to which
they are not suited. Flowers ara
like races of humans. Some thrive
in warm , moist climates. Others,
through the centuries, have become
accustomed to intensive
cold.
Certain flowers, for instance,
may be grown successfully in
comparatively cool, semi-shaded
locations. If you have such spots
in your yard, don’t plant your
zinnias or petunias there.
Any of the following will prove
more satisfactory, according to
Harry A. Joy, flower expert: Annuals
— balsam, clarkia, coleus,
nasturtium, pansy, calendula and
vinca: perennials—English daisy,
cam panula, columbine, myosotis,
sweet W illiam and viola.
If you live in drouthy sections
or if your flower beds are on
well-drained soil in full sun, try
the following: Annuals—abronia,
ageratum, alyssum procumbens,
arctotis, calliopsis, candytuft,
cosmos, four o ’clock, lupin texensis,
petunia, portulaca, sunflower,
verbena, and zinnia: perennials—
coreopsis and hollyhock.

“ Into the Whirling Knives’*
H e l l o , e v e r y b o d y :
Here’s a tale of the wheat fields of Canada, an exciting
account of how a man, trying to yank loose a sheaf of wheat
that was plugging the blades of a threshing rig, suddenly found
himself being carried along toward them by the machinery he
had succeeded in freeing.
It was a frightful experience, and Howard C. Flanders of
Rutland, Vermont, won’t forget it till the day he dies. Incidentally,
I ’m flattered—and a bit curious—to learn that my column
in the New York Journal is read way up in Rutland,
Vermont.
Howard’s story begins back in 1924, when he was a youth of
16 living in the town of Sherbrooke, Quebec. In those days,
during the fall of the year they would import men from the East
and even from Great Britain to work in the harvest fields of
western Canada.
As Howard puts it succinctly: “ The dough was good, the hours long,
•tc ., so I decided I would try it.”
A wick later Howard left Sherbrooke on the Harvesters’ Special.
A week later he arrived in Calgary, Alberta. A tram that ran only
three times a week took him on to Granger, Alberta, and thence he
went by bus to Carbon. Here he gut a job in the wheat fields and
worked three weeks.
“ So far, so good,” Howard says. ” 1 then went to work for a threshing
outfit where I came near losing my neck—or feet would be more
like it."
Howard Jumped on the Carrier to Free the Knives.
Then he says: “ I don't know it you understand a threshing rig,
but I'll explain as best I can. The only part that concerns me is the
Throughout the long roll of the
centuries there have been innum
erable perfumes.
However, the bases—the fixatives
—were a few natural products, the
most famous of which is musk. Several
animals produce musk, but the
best comes from the male musk
deer of the H imalayas, according to
an authority in the Philadelphia
Record.
The musk deer i i only 20 inches
high, has no antlers and its teeth
project like tusks in the male This
tiny deer carries beneath the skin
of his stomach a sack about the
size of an orange, in which is found
a dark brown substance, somewhat
like wet gingerbread (found only in
the male)
This "m u s k ” is about the strongest
smelling substance known, rather
aromatic and pleasant. The deer
is killed, the musk sack extracted
end dried, then packed by camel |
c a ia v a n across the immense clam !
of Asia to the centers where it finds
its way into world trade.
Long before the Christian era
men were killing musk deer and
dealing in the musk they obtained
from them.
Musk is mixed with many other
ingredients, whose odors it seems
to blend into a whole. In color it
is dark purplish, in texture dry,
smooth and unctuous to the touch,
in taste bitter.
So pervading is it that the scent
remains for centuries. In 1558
"B loody” Mary of England ordered
Lady Cecily Cholmondoley imprisoned
in the Tower of London. The
governor of the tower, who sympathized
with his fair prisoner, had
her cell perfumed with musk. The
characteristic perfume is (till discernible
after nearly 400 years.
Chemically musk contains am monia.

Certainly he liked the idea of
taking that woman, to be his

there’s a strong resemblance between
the new Mrs. Markey and the
first one, Jo a n Bennett, as Joan appears
in her brunette wig in “ Trade

resemblance in the setting of “Trade

which Hedy L aM arr stars—“ Lady

This business of tracing resemblances

Mrs. Smith was particularly fond
of reminding her husband that the
silver was hers, the piano was hers,
and the furniture was hers, and
Smith was getting tired of it.
One night Mrs Smith was awak.

“ B u rg la rs !" echoed Smith, wearily.

An American woman who spent
last summer in Europe tells of her
ellorts to say "th ank you" to a
waiter who had been particularly
helpful.
“ As I passed him the tip 1 started
to say ‘Thank you' in German, revised
it with a bit of French, added
a little Italian, and—well, in the
midst of my floundering, imagine
my chagrin when the waiter suddenly
interrupted.

By C. HOUSTON GOUDISS
THE gap between winter and spring has always been recognized
as a trying period. Work seems a burden, tempers
are short, appetites are poor, and little enjoyment is
derived from meals.
Just as the daily tide of human vitality is at a low
ebb during the hours before dawn, so does the annual tide
of health reach a low ebb in the weeks that mark the end
of winter and the official be-» ■
ginning of spring. > obvious that unless adequate

Moreover, it has been
found that many minor disturbances
of the body cause a loss of
iron, and that mild infections are
a common cause of iron loss.
Thus, individuals who have been
consuming a diet that is barely
adequate in respect to iron may
find themselves on the borderline
of iron deficiency following an infection.

that cannot be dispelled merely

The Best Spring Tonic
A generation ago it was believed
that sulphur and molasses,
j ______________ and sassafras te j
would overcome
springtime debility.
Homemakers
dosed their fam ilies
with a variety
of-so-called tonics,
in a frantic effort
to put color into
pale cheeks, to

rear of the outfit. There is a carrier—something of the endless belt
variety. You pull up alongside this carrier with your team and rack,
grab your pitchfork and get going.”
As you threw your wheat sheaves on the carrier, Howard
explains, it took them to the mouth of the machine where a series
of knives work up and down so fast the eye could not fallow
them. These knives, as Howard puts it, “ do a job on the wheat,”
and also cuts the cord that holds the bundle together.
“ We would work like mules,” Howard goes on, "unloading so as to
get through and catch up a few minutes on the other fellow and take
it easy. Sometimes we would plug the rig and the carrier would stop,
and that's all.”
This certain day—September 29, 1924, to be exact—the rig
plugged on them, and not thinking, Howard jum ped on the carrier
and grabbed a sheaf that was plugging the knives and started
to pull and yank.
"A ll of a sudden,” Howard says, “ it let go and there I was—
riding along to those knives and destruction.”
Picture the scene for yourself—the carrier, with Howard on board,
moving slowly but inevitably toward the flashing knives that, freed now
of their obstruction, were slashing at a speed that made them invisible
to the eye.
To make matters worse, Howard, because he had been obliged
to go close to the knives in order to free them, was now practically
on top of them, being carried closer every second by the
speeding carrier, as it picked up momentum it had lost when
the sheaf had blocked it.
Howard heard a yell. It may have been that yell that broke the
spell that his startled senses were under. At any rate, he was galvanized
into action. Ju s t as the greedy knives were reaching for his
clothes to drag h im in and shred him to death, he swung, jum ped on
to the bundle rack of his wagon!
Breathless, his heart pounding, his limbs so weak he could hardly
hold himself together, Howard climbed down to the ground. And then,
suddenly, he remembered the yell, and the strange quality that made it
somehow more than just a cry of warning. He looked about.
The Mystery of the Machine Owner.
On the opposite side of the machine he found one of the owners of
the outfit with his right hand all mangled and bleeding at his side!
“ In his h urry,” Howard explains, “ he said he had been pulling
a chain on the outside of the carrier, trying to help the
bundles through, and when she started he looked up, and there
I was riding merrily along. His story was that the only thing
to do was to plug those gears some way and slow up that carrier
or stop it and give me a chance to get off, and not having anything
to use he slaps his hand between the gears and it slowed It
up and gave me the chance to save myself.”
To this day, Howard says, he can’t remember whether that platform
slacked up in its speed or not. He does know he got himself clear.
“ I have often wondered," Howard goes on to say, “ if the m an in
his hurry to get the thing going, had taken hold of one of the crosspieces
of the gear and yanked on it. and when she started, slipped and
went into the gear himself—or whether he was the means of saving my
life or limbs. I don't know. The least I could do was thank h im , which
I did.
" A week later he gave me the gate and I have been wondering
ever since just what did happen.”
Howard finally got home broke but happy. I hope he stays happy,
but just in case he ever goes broke again, here’s ten bucks he can put
aside for an ace-in-the-hole!

Iron-Rich Foodi
Every homemaker, therefore,
should make a determined effort
to include plenty of iron-rich foods
in her menus. These foods include
liver, eggs, whole grain cereals.
dried fruits, lean meats and
s o o th e i r r i t a b l e j green leafy vegetables.
Green vegetables cannot be emphasized
too strongly, for they
tend somewhat to be crowded out
of the winter diet by the starchy
and fatty foods which provide
more heat and energy And investigations
with children have
demonstrated that when vegetables
and fruits are limited, there
is a certain sluggishness of blood
formation, (ireen vegetables not
only supply iron in significant
amounts, but their iron has heen
found to be especially well absorbed
from Ihe digestive tract.

set the effects of a too highly concentrated
winter diet. Very often
that feeling of lassitnde, mistakenly
called spring fever, can be overcome
by adding to the diet a larger
proportion o( these naturally
laxative foods.
It's also desirable to take an
adequate supply of fluids to help
flush the system of waste. In addition
to a generous amount of water,
there should be a pint of milk
daily for every adult, a quart for
every child, and fruit juices in
abundance. Orange juice, grapefruit
juice, pineapple juice and tomato
juice all supply vitamins A,
B and C, and their refreshing fruit
acids have a beneficial efTect upon
the appetite.
Eiercise and Freth Air
Two more splendid antidotes for
the let-down feeling that comes at
this season are moderate exercise
and fresh air. The proper use of
the muscular system is important
to health' and vitality, yet many
people go through the winter taking
far too little exercise.
In general, you will eat better,
sleep better, feel more alert and
at the same time more relaxed, if
you make a point of getting out
into the open every day.
Sleep, sunshine, fresh air and
the right food—these are Nature’s
tonics!

Enriching the Blood
The blood is frequently impoverished
by the time spring puts in
an appearance. That is not surprising.
for in many households
the winter diet contains a prepon
derance of carbohydrates and
fats, with far too few of the pre
cious minerals and vitamins. It
is often deficient in iron, the m ineral
that is required for the for
mation of the hemoglobin or red
pigment in the blood, and in copper,
which is required for the
proper utilization of iron.

m aintain the acid-base balance of
the body.
Plenty of Bulk Required
There is still another reason
why green vegetables and fruits
should be consumed in liberal
quantities. These foods, along
with whole grain cereals, provide
an abundance of bulk or cellulose
which is necessary to help promote
regularity. They tend to off-

\\ \NTED— MOTHER FOR NANCY
DR EW
Bonita Granville wants a mother—
that is a film mother in the series of
“ Nancy Drew” pictures she is acting
in for Warner Bros. The second of
the series, “ Nancy Drew, Reporter,”
will be shown at the Badger Theatre
March 29 and 30.
Of course Bonita has John Litel as
her father; a kind, understanding and
doting father. He wras introduced in
the first Nancy Drew picture as her
father and he will continue as her
father.
For some reason or other, Carolyn
Keene, the author of the popular
books on which the series of films is
being based, never provided a mother'
for Nancy. I.ike Topsy, apparently,
she “jes growed.” But Bonita is at
the romantic age and she thinks i t !
would be nice if her father enjoyed a
romance and added a wife to the fam-;

should I look for trouble? I think we
had better let the matter drop for the

M G-M's ‘The CiLadel’,” says Wiley Padan. “This adaptation of
A. J. Cronin’s current best-selling novel, dealing with the career
of a physician, is the second of a series of M-G-M’s British-made
pictures. ‘A Yank at Oxford’ was the first and ‘Good-Bye, Mr.
Chips’ may be the third.”

KENNETH S. SCHLYTTER, Agent.
Isn’t It Time You Had a
JOHN D EERE TRACTOR?
I t ’s not a long step from horse-farming
to power-farming with the John
Deere. Farm boys hardly old enough
to drive three horse* operate this
tractor. And it doesn’t require a mechanic to keep
it in good running order. You can do it yourself,
right out on your farm.
The John Deere gives you everything you want
in a tractor for your heavy farm jobs—adaptability,
poucr, economy, light weight, simplicity, and accessibility.
It supplies drawbar, belt, and power takeoff
service to reduce your labor costs, to do your
work when it should be done, to give you more time
for other duties or for rccrc.'.tion.
Investigate the John Deere fully. Ask any one
you know who owns one. Come in and let us show
you why the new model is better than ever.
