FORTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1939 NUMBER 52
Dairy Advertising Plan
The Wisconsin Dairy Industries association
held its annual meeting in
Madison recently and after reelecting
last year’s officers adopted a plan
whereby Wisconsin dairy plants will
be able to contribute for Wisconsin’s
shr»re of a national dairy advertising
campaign.
Officers reelected were: Bryce
Landt. Wisconsin Cooperative Creamery
Ass’n., Wisconsin Dells, president;
August Kanning, C. J. Ebert, Wisconsin
Cheesemakers Ass’n., Gresham;
treasurer; and Fred Huntzicker, Wisconsin
Cheese Producers Cooperative.
Greenwood, secretary.
Together with Harry Jack, president
of the Wisconsin Cooperative Milk
Pool, the above officers make up a
planning board and will meet with W.
W. Clark of the University Extension
Division and Russel E. Frost of the
department of agriculture and markets
for the purpose of laying a campaign
for raising $100,000 from the industry
itself for advertising and promotion
work.
In this program Wisconsin is joining
Minnesota and Iowa where similar
quotas already have been raised.
The directors adopted an agreement
which gives the dairy plants the option
of contributing 50 cents for each
1,000 pounds of butterfat purchased or
handled during the preceding month
or a check off of % cent a pound of
butter fat purchased at the factory
during the first two weeks in August.
The Wisconsin Dairy Industries association
is now pursuing its original
plan of voluntary contribution in order
that Wisconsin might join other dairy
states in a national dairy advertising
campsign. Several months ago a measure
which would have made a checkoff
system mandatory by law was refused
passage by the legislature. The
defeated bill proposed to levy an assessment
of approximately ten cents
per cow during a single month of
every year. The voluntary check-off
plan now proposed will seek a similar
contribution.
Cold Weather Encampment
The first “cold weather encampment”
in 20 years began last Saturday
for the Wisconsin National Guard
when it assembled for a three week
training period at Camp McCoy, near
Sparta.
About 5.500 officers and enlisted
men will attend the encampment under
conditions unfamiliar to at least the
younger men. Instead of living in
tents and sleeping in cots, the men will
be in heated, insulated and electrically
lighted barracks equipped with spring
cots and mattresses. Gloves, winter
caps with earlaps, and overcoats are
issued to all enlisted men.
In addition to regular work, training
includes scouting and patrolling,
night operations, security and reconnaissance
problems, concealment in
bivouac and position, and defensive
• and counter combat maneuvers.
The fall training will supplement
regular summer training at Camp
Williams, and Camp Douglas, w’hich
demonstrated that the Wisconsin unit
is one of the best in the*United States.
I t is expected that the fall training
will change the Guard’s present rating
of “very satisfactory” and “excellent”
to “superior” regardless of weather
conditions.
From November 4 through November
11 about 1,530 men from the 32nd
Division staff and the 57th Field A rtillery
Brigade will attend the first encampment.
Camp Commander will be
Major General Irving A. Fish of tht
32nd -Division.
About 2,510 men from the 64th
Infantry Brigade. 32nd Tank Company,
and 32nd Military Police Company
will be at the camp from November
11 through November 17. And
from November 18 through November
24, 1,050 men from the Headquarters
Troop of fhe 53rd Cavalry Britrade,
105th Cavalry Regiment, 135th Medical
Regiment, and 107th Quartermaster
regiment, will be at the camp.
Brigadier General Ralph M. Immell
will be camp commander during the
last two weeks period.
Consumer Savings
Almost $47,000 a year will be saved
by 2,000 Wisconsin telephone and electric
utility customers because of rate
reductions authorized or ordered by
the state public service commission
during September.
The reduced rates affect 1.177 electric
utility customers, who will save
$39,809 a year, and 855 telephone subscribers
who will saye $6,850.
During September the commission
held 274 public hearings in utility,
water power, railroad, and motor

Buys Old Meisner Building
Ben Klapste, owner of the local
Gamble agency store, last week
bought the old Meisner two-story
brick building on Vinal street from
the Wittenberg Co-Operative company.
Mr. Klapste, who has been operating
his store in the Henry Kersten building
on Webb street for several years,
does not expect to move his stock to
the new location until some time after
Christmas.
Meanwhile he expects to make several
improvements in the building. It
is one of the oldest business blocks in
Wittenberg, having been erected about
45 years ago by the late Herman
Meisner. One half of the building, for
many years occupied by W. D. Haseltine
as a law office and later by
Komp’s shoe repair shop, is now vacant.
The other half is where A lbrecht’s
tavern is located. Mr. Klapste
will use the vacant part for his
new location.

Hurt in Fall
Emerson Cottrell, of Eland, suffered
a broken arm, severe lacerations and
bruises and possible internal injuries
! Saturday afternoon when he fell 14
! feet to the cement walk in front of
j the Rettig meat market in Eland. He
j was adjusting storm windows from the
top of a porch when he slipped and
fell.
where is the peace we died for?
Where is the faith? The goodwill?”
The third Unknown had stood with
Wellington at Waterloo. It was a
high enthusiasm that had carried there
— the vision of a world free from tyranny
and wrong. He fell; was buried
in a trench, under a rude cross marked
“Unknown.**
We thought it was to be the world’s
last great battle,” he said. “There
would be no more wars, no more
youthful lives snuffed out, no more
mothers waiting and weeping at home.
“ But a century went by and there
came a war beside which ours seemed
a little thing. Our friend over whom
the bands played today was one of the
millions who gave their lives. Men
have heaped honors on him such as we
never had. Do the honors mean that
the hearts of men have changed, I
wonder? They broke faith with us;
will they keep faith with h im ? ”
The three dim figures disappeared.
The moon stood guard over the silent
grave. In the East the fir^t rays of
the morning crept into the sky. They
reached out vaguely, hesitatingly
touching the city of Washington where
men were to gather that day to speak
of pear-e touching an inscription
which the nation had cut in the stone
above the body of its unknown soldier.
Saturday we celebrate Armistice
Day. Our country is arming as she
has never armed in all her history. A
new generation has grown to manhood
and womanhood since the first Armistice
Day twenty»one years ago. What
does this Armistice Day mean to us?
What does it promise?
In 1921 on Armistice Day our nation
dedicated a Memorial to the “Unknown
Soldier,” whose body was returned to
America from a French cemetery
after the WTorld War. On the theme
of “The Unknown Soldier,” Bruce Barton
wrote the following essay which
to some is familiar; to some, new. To
all it has a message:
Unknown
From thc grave of the Unknown
Soldier the crowds melted away. The
great men of thur nations, who had
stood there bareheaded, stepped into
their cars and were w’hirled back to
town. The music of the bands grew
faint and ceased.
All afternoon little parties of curious,
reverent folk came and stopped,
and went on again until finally only
the guard remained. The day ended.
Night came silently and threw over
the grave the healing mantle of darkness.
Then a strange thing happened!
Three dim figures from nowhere gathered
and stood uncovered beside the
tomb. No word of greeting passed between
them; they sc»emcd to know
each other well. Slowly, one after an-1
other, they stooped and read the
freshly carved inscription. Then the
oldest spoke. “Things are improving i
for us unknown, he said I fought i W(? have buried him and carved an in
with Leonidas at Thermopylae. j srnptjon over his tomb,

are mingled with the dust and rocks.
No one marked our resting place. Our
names have perished but we held the
pass.
“ My mother wept when I failed to
return,” he continued. “ Night after
night she waited at the window until
it was foolish to hope any longer.
Then she, too, wanted to die. But the
neighbors came in and cheered her.
“You have given a son to save your
country.” they cried. “The Persians
are driven back nnd Greece is freed.
He died, but he left us a better world.”
The Unknown Soldier paused for a
moment, his voice grew dull and hard.
“The Romans swept over the Gr«*ec«
SCHOOL NEWS
School Masters
The local school men attended their
monthly meeting at the Eland Hotel
Wednesday night. Judge Dillett, of
Shawano, was the speaker of the evening.
The local boys’ Trio, Luther
Mason, Kermit Johnson and Robert
Olsen, entertained with a few musical
numbers and Miss Phyllis Turecek
played two piano selections.
Vocational Guidance
Each year a member of the Marquette
faculty gives a talk before the
high school assembly. The subject is
always on some phase of vocational
guidance of particular interest to
Seniors. This year’s message was
given by Dr. Lamars on Thursday of
this week.
Thanksgiving Vacation
The W'ittenberg school will close on
the 29th day of Nov. for its Thanksgiving
holidays. Most every one favors
four day vacation rather than to
celebrate on the two days which have
been designated in this state as legal
holidays.
First Basketball Show Friday Night
Wittenberg fans will get their first
look at the 1939-1940 basketball teams
Friday night. They have been practicing
for a month and should be in
good shape for this their game. Amherst
will bring a squad that is expected
to go places in,the Central Wisconsin
circuit this year and should
furnish some stiff opposition for the
local boys. The feature game will be
at 8:45, second teams at 7:30 and the
trrade school team will play the Children’s
Home boys at 6:45.

Project Approved
for Wittenberg
Extensive Road Improvement
in Shawano County Has Also
Been Approved by the Federal
Administration
The work projects administration
announced Wednesday that President
Roosevelt had approved a $213,730
road improvement project for Shawano
county, Wisconsin.
He also approved projects for Chippewa
Falls, to improve drainage facilities
at the Northern Wisconsin fair
grounds, $8,710; Park Ridge, improve
streets, $10,062; Reedsville, improve
sewage disposal plant grounds, $8,068;
Wittenberg, develop recreational area,
$6,653, and Tomah, improve park,
$2,887.
Final approval must come from the
state WPA administrator, dependent
upon availability of funds and presence
of certified relief labor.
The local project provides for the
clearing and filling in of village property
northwest of Washington Park
and the erection of a modem band
shell.
Where the more than two hundred
thousand dollars are to be expended
in road improvements, we do not know
at the present writing. Further information
in regard to this project will
no doubt soon be available for publication.
It is believed here the money
will be used on farm to market roads.

did a good job of blasting U. S. munitions

Two cases in point: The Kingsland,

inal at Hoboken, just across.the
Hudson from Manhattan. After 20
years of bickering, Nazidom's Dr.
Victor Huecking deserted the mixed
claims commission last June, just
before Imperial Germany was found
responsible for the disasters. Story’s
end: In Washington, what was
left of the mixed commission awarded
approximately $50,000,000 to
Americans, including $21,157,227 in
damages plus 5 per cent interest.
Though Adolf Hitler will have no
truck with the case, Germany has
a special deposit account in the U. S.
treasury of between $23,000,000 and
$26,000,000 to meet the award. The
treasury also holds about half a
billion “ paper value” in German republic
bonds, but it looked like
American claimants would be lucky
to get the principal, minus interest.
POLITICS:
T hird Term Talk
In late October a Gallup poll
showed Franklin Roosevelt’s popularity
to be greater than in 1936,
when he got 62.5 per cent of the m a jor
party vote. Gallup rating today:
64.9 per cent. Less emphatic, thirdterm
sentiment rose to 43 per cent
compared with 40 before the war.
But many anti-third term voters said
they might change their minds if the
war continues.
Much bigger political news was
the feeling in Washington that President
Roosevelt will not seek a third
term, an undercover sentiment that
has made many an anti-New Dealer
support his neutrality bill (See CONGRESS).
Certainly he is discouraging nomination
talk. Observers learned he

Soviet kept encouraging Bulgaria’s
demands for return of Dobruja (see

King Carol knew what that meant.
Should trouble come with Bulgaria,
Russia could follow her Polish tactics
by marching into Bessarabia to
“ protect” White Russians. Meanwhile
Hungary would not be above
“ saving” her own nationals now under
R um anian rule. International
observers were convinced this was
no joke, and so was Carol. He summoned
his envoys to Turkey, Bulgaria,
Greece and Jugo-Slavia for a
conference, and next day Premier
Constantine Argetoianu met Jugoslavia's
Premier Dragisha Tsvetkovitch

from Italy: W’ould she demand that
Russia keep hands off. thereby
breaking with Germany? It seemed
a good bet.
THE W A R :
Rehound
When Swiss President Philipp Etter
visited the intersection of Germ
an - French - Swiss frontiers, he
passed cigarettes to his own troops,
next handed them across the line to
French soldiers, then offered the
pack to the German guards. This
did not look like a German-French
war. Neither did the communiques.
Said Berlin's: “ No special happen-
I ings.” Said P aris! “ Very reduced
I activity during the night.”
There was no sign of peace behind
German lines, however. Al-
: lied reconnaisance revealed about
1.500.000 Nazi troops concentrated
on Swiss, Belgian. Netherlands and
French frontiers, indicating a possible
invasion of the lesser neutral
states. Opposing them were the
same number of French troops and
J about 158.000 British.
Still the war did not start despite
frontier jitters which were heightened
when the Reich cut telephone
j communications all along this 500-
i mile frontier. Observers believed
1 only bad weather or Adolf H itler’s
| whim stood between German troops
I and a large-scale offensive. There
; was also a chance Hitler awaited
j support from Russia.
Nazidom had no fear of an allied
■ offensive, but that very assurance
constituted an even greater fear.
I Poorly fed and nervously strained,
Germany cannot endure a long war
j of attrition such as Britain and
j France will no doubt wage. Some
! observers believe the “ war of
I nerves” which Hitler used to such
advantage earlier this year is now
i rebounding, and that Naziism may
1 soon give way to army rule.
| CONGRESS:
To tho House
British-French cheers reverberat-
| ed across the Atlantic when the U. S.
| senate passed, 63 to 30, the administration’s
neutrality bill which permits
cash-and-carry sale of munij
tions to belligerents. Berlin was resentful
and Rome was sad, the latter
forecasting a longer war if
America aided, the allies. In R ussia,
the newspaper Izvestia commented
sourly that “ war in Europe
was met by Wall Street with poorly
disguised rejoicing in expectation of
profits on war orders.”
(The V. S. wns already on bad terms
with Russia since the I . S. S. City of

I nored, but it was learned the 41 men j

I many. Stopping at Tromsoe, Norwny, the j
Hint hoi ordered away.)
| Still awaited was the house vote
i on ne u trally . Administration leaders
arranged to have the rules com-
! mittee bring out a simple resolution
j sending the measure to conference
| with the senate, a move made possible
by the house's passage of a
modified version of the program
last summer. Then the only house
vote on the embargo would center on
a resolution to instruct house agents
to insist on the partial arms embargo.
If the resolution failed, quick
agreement was certain since most
conferees are pro-repeal.
As house debate opened, administrationists
forecast victory by at
least 30 points. Isolationists, insisting
the result would hinge on about
10 votes, hoped pressure from back
home would sway fence straddlers
to their side.
But after neutrality, what next?
Although Franklin Roosevelt wanted
congress to go hdme, many an anti-
New Dealer wanted to sit pat until
the war was over—whether a year
or a decade.

WASHINGTON.—Not because it is
necessarily true, but because the
type of stories going around at any
given time is always significant, one
curious yarn is now being told by
certain old-timers in Washington
i seeking to draw an analogy between
what Theodore the F irst did and
what Franklin the First m ay do.
It is told by men who, contrary
to the more general opinion, believe
that President
Roosevelt w ill not
seek renomination
by the Democratic
1 national conve 1 on
next June. But they
U L j / ! believe ju st as firm-
^ tha* d cs *n‘
\ J tend to run again for
v:% £ a r President, preferably
in 1944.
They point out that
the anti-th rd term
President prejudice was im-
Roosevelt portant to Theodore
Roosevelt—that he would not take
the nomination in 1908, and that he
forced the nomination of a m an he
hand-picked, W illiam Howard Taft.
F urther, they pointed out that Theodore
did seek election as President
! in 1912. sought the nomination again
in 1916, and would in all human
probability have been nominated,
had he lived, in 1920.
On these points there is no doubt
whatever. T. R .’s fight in 1912. as
the Bull Moose nominee, his battle
against Charles Evans Hughes in
the 1916 convention, and his backing
of Taft for ti e nomination in
1908 are matters of official record.
As to whether he would have been
nominated in 1920 there might be
an argument, but there are s till living
Republican leaders to whom one
of T. R .’s bitterest enemies in 1912
and 1916, the late Sen. Boies Penrose
of Pennsylvan.a, conceded, just
before T. R .’s death, that he would
have to support the “ Colonel” for
the nomination in 1920.
B e v e rid g e E x p la in e d W h y
T . R . D i d N o t R u n i n 1908
The story told for the first time
recently in Washington is that at a
dinner party, given by the late Sen.
Albert J . Beveridge of Indiana,
while T. R. was in Africa, the Indiana
senator, who was very close to
the former President was asked why
T. R. had not run in 1908.
Beveridge is alleged to have answered
that the ’Colonel” had believed
the Republicans were in for a
licking, but that “ this fat fellow,”
meaning Taft, had surprised h im by
getting elected!
What the tellers of the story are
trying to prove here is their own
conviction that F ranklin Roosevelt,
realizing that there is a strong prejudice
against a third “ continuous”
term for the presidency, is figuring
on stepping out for four years, after
which he hopes the country will be
almost unanimous in wanting him
back.
A ll this has been related because
the writer believes it of interest as
: showing what certain well-informed
people think. But as this writer sees
it there are several flaws in the analogy.
One of them is what seems a
stronger probability that F. D. R.
does not think there would be any
im portant danger of defeat, third
term or no third term, if he ran for
re-election. Assuming that he does
i so think, it is well known how dear
to his heart is the breaking of precedents.
Further, it is scarcely to be
questioned that F. D. R. believes,
conscientiously and firmly, that the
country would be better off for the
four years beginning in 1941 with
himself at the head of the government
than with any other person,
whether hand-picked by h im or not.
D r o u t h M a y F o r c e T V A
T o E m p l o y S t r a i n P l a n t s
The severe drouth which has affected
the entire Tennessee river
valley promises to produce some
very embarrassing results for TVA
unless there are record-breaking
rains this winter. Already TVA aui
thorities have cut down the amount
I of run-off water from Norris dam
to a mere fraction of that considered
vital to m aintain navigation on the
Tennessee river. Complaints are
. plenty, but are not being heeded.
Water in the lake held back by
1 Norris dam is still above the 963-
foot-above-sea-level figure at which
the m ax im um efficiency can be
maintained. But it is held there,
even now, only by “ cheating” on
1 the navigation requirements. And
even with that it is not quite being
held. It has been dropping despite
the cutting down of spillway water.
The joker is that unless torrential
rains fall this winter Norris and
other dams in the TVA system will
not be able to supply enough electric
power next spring to m aintain their
contracts without resorting to steam
plants. This is complicated by the
fact that several of the steam plants
taken over in the recent deal by
which TVA, and local authorities
purchased the Tennessee properties
of the Commonwealth  Southern
are not as efficient as the TVA experts
had figured.
The truth seems to be that the
Commonwealth  Southern, working
for the last few years with an ax
over its head, had not spent any
money on these plants. They had
not been kept in good condition, according
to information here, much
less brought up to date. Hence while
they can be operated they are not
efficient. Cost of producing power at
them is very high.
So to be compelled to use these
plants to produce enough current to
carry out the TVA contracts next
spring would m ean, according to experts,
that the TVA would be selling
current for less than it costs to produce.
Im p o s s ib le f o r L a y m a n to
K n o w W h i c h S id e Is R ig h t
O f course this is an old charge.
It was alleged by Dr. A rthur E.
Morgan during the hearings before
the special congressional committee
which held hearings last year. But
it is so complicated that it is almost
impossible for a laym an to know
which side is right. One little element,
for example, is whether interest
should be charged on the
g overnment’s investment — and
whether the amount of this investm
ent allocated to power—as compared
with navigation and flood control—
is adequate.
It would seem from the present
performance, where the channel has
been lowered below the figure
agreed upon in order to preserve
water for power purposes, that perhaps
not so much ought to be
charged to navigation. Sum m er before
last it seemed to some engineers
that the amount of water being
held back by the dam s was
dangerously high if flood prevention
insurance were properly considered.
At that tim e .the water level in the
lake behind Norris d am was so
high that if heavy rains had followed
the d am would have been
useless for flood prevention purposes.
So maybe the figure allocated in
the cost for flood prevention was a
little high. If both these are too
high it seems entirely possible that
considerably more of the original
cost of the project should have been
charged to power.
But even without m aking any such
! changes in the actual cost of current
which these two elements would
j produce, and taking the TVA’s own
j estimates, there is no doubt whatever
that TVA will be selling current
below cost next spring unless
record-breaking rains come this
winter.
L in d b e r g h * s A t t it u d e o n
C a n a d a F i n d in g S u p p o r t
Col. Charles A. Lindbergh’s suggestion
that the United States should
dominate C anada’s foreign policy,
or at least that Canada s foreign
relations should conform to Pan-
American standards, thus severing
the Dominion's tie with Great Britain,
struck many
hearers as merely
impolitic, but for a
substantial m i n o r ity,
it has developed,
it struck a respon-
Mfc 1 sive chord.
This minority is
not clear-cut as to
its objectives beyond
a certain point, and
is very evasive
about how it would
Colonel reach them, but it is
Lindbergh im portant enough to
m erit consideration.
There is passionate agreement
about the first point—that Canada
should not be allowed the right to
drag the United States into a world
war—or any war for that matter—
growing out of C anada’s connection
with the British empire. Hence there
is general agreement—among this
minority—that Canada should withdraw
from the British Commonwealth
of Nations.
The same desire to have Old
world ties severed goes for Jam a ic a ,
Bermuda, the British, French and
Dutch Guianas, British Honduras,
Martinique, Curacaco, and all the
rest of the Americas which at present
fly European flags.
None of the minority so far discovered
by this writer consider that
force would be necessary to impose
this.
A d m i t A d m i n i s t r a t i o n
l i a s N o t B e e n N e u t r a l
Curiously enough, nearly every
one of this minority desiring to d ivorce
all the Americas from European
ties are New Dealers, and
I nearly every one of them, though
j agreeing with the New Deal on everything
else, disagrees violently
with President Roosevelt’s foreign
policies since the outbreak of the
war. They will admit, with sadness,
that the administration has
not been neutral—that virtually every
action taken by Roosevelt or
this government since the war
clouds began to hover has been distinctly
pro-British and French.
The much talked about 300-mile
zone around the Americas *is, however,
one of the things these “ Pan
Americans” do no agree about.
Many of them are enthusiastic about
it, though agreeing that it would be
a distinct help to Britain and
France, and a headache for Germany.
The “ Pan Americans” adm it that i
there is a sharp division inside the j
administration about the whole war
policy. Some of the New Dealers, j
they insist, are on their side.

IN H IS new book, “ The Defense ol

. . . . - u . t h a t m o d e r r ; Win, Says H a r t war canno, be
supported in the style to which ii
has been accustomed, and observes
that “ War will only be ended when
the power-lusting nations recognize
its futility. The growing power ol
modern defense is bringing that
prospect in sight.”
In his preceding book, “ Europe
in A rm s,” published in August, 1937,
he thought there was hope of ending
war in the limitations of the m ilitary
m ind. Fat-headed generals
would cling to gaudy mass attack
and make war so stupid and ridiculous
that anybody surviving would
just forget it. But the trouble with
a war expert is that you can’t bottle
him up, and other nations in the
past have used him as a military
consultant.
In the World war, a stripling
just out of Cambridge, a captain
and a war correspondent, he
gave the generals a lacing to the
lim it of the censorship, and, although
they growled menacingly,
they took him into their
counsels. He invented a lot of
new trick plans, including the
“ indirect approach” and the “ expanding
torrent” system, and
his reputation was well on its
way before the war ended.
He has scolded many of the main
p anjandrum s of the big war, in the
post-war years, apparently with
public approval, judging from the
sale of his books. He was a war
buddy of Lawrence of Arabia and
insisted that this human cryptogram
knew more about war than all the
generals put together.

Today’s popularity

of the able physicians
who test the value of
Doan’s under exacting

TTiese physicians, too, approve every word
of advertising you read, the objective of
which is only to recommend Doan's Pills
M a good diuretic treatment for disorder
of the kidney function and for relief oi
the pain and worry it causes.
I f more people were aware of how the
kidneys must constantly remove waste
that cannot stay in the blood without inju

of why the whole body suffer*
when kidneys lag. and diuretic medication
would be more often employed.
Burning, scanty or too frequent urination
sometimes warn of disturbed kidney

Moses L a fa y e tte O ’L e a ry , w ith a

life of m y s p ir it’— p erh aps the m ost
h u m a n cry in a ll literature.
“ A n d God took pity on h im , g r a n ting
h im a reprieve of 15 years, p u ttin
g b ack the clock of tim e : Behold
I w ill bring a g a in thc shadow
of the degrees, w hich is gone down

gave the first p u b lic clock to P a n s
in 1370, says M r. Le G allie n n e . “ The
clock we still see, w ith its beautiful

In olden days, m ost men about
town ca rrie d two w atches on th e ir

Y e t this p recautio n w as rather useless,
M r. Le G a llie n n e says, for
when they d id n 't agree it was a question
of w hich t o %believe. For in stance:
“ A witty story is told of the f a m
ous d an d y , the Marechal de

Commission reporters took in shorthand
3,683 pages of testimony to keep
a record of the hearings as required
by law.
Simplify Court Trials
Beginning January 1, 1940, Wiscon
sin judges will be able to call attor
neys together in pre-trial conferences
to agree on issues and procedures and
thus simplify and speed court trials.
The procedure, outlined in an order
issued by the state supreme court, is
established in England, Germany, and
France, but has not yet been generally
adopted in the United States.
The order permits judges to direct
attorneys for the parties in a law suit
to appear in a pre-trial conference to
consider the simplification of the is
sues; the necessity or desirability of
amendments to the pledgings; the pos
sibility of obtaining admissions of fact
and of documents which will avoid unnecessary
proof; the limitation of the
number of expert witnesses; the ad
visability of a preliminary reference
of issues for find ing to be used as
evidence when the trial is to be by
jury; such other matters as may aid
in the disposition of the action.
Trials will be speeded because the
attorneys and the judge will thus have
an understanding of the issues and
the duplication of expert testimoa}
will be eliminated.
Capitol Notes
Governor Julius Heil has ordered
an ouster hearing to be held in Milwaukee
November 15. for Wilbert P.
Gumm. chairman of the state real
estate broker's license board. Charges
against Gumm are that he overcharged
the state $100 during the
month of Ju ly for salary and expenses.
It is also charged that Gumm owes
the state an income tax delinquency
for the years 1935, 1937 and 1938, and
that he has borrowed money from employes
of the real estate hoard and
has refused to pay it. The charges
against Gumm were made by August
Frey, head of the Governor's new
bureau of research.
The 11th annual “get togeth* v" ('*'
the Wise n>:n Council of Agriculture
was held in Madison last week with
about 400 rerresen* • ves of 37 farm
organizations attending. Governor
Heil ;n addressim' he Madison meeting
told farmers *h -t Henrv fthl, Jr.,
president of the Wisconsin Federation
of Labor ‘‘was lyi >ar” ar.d “ speaking a
falsehood”, when he accused the present
administration of “fooling the
farmer.”
Another grou*. of farmers, member*
of the Farmer’s F oiity Union met in
Portage, forty mi'-- from the canit-'1
city for their annual state convention
Tt was at this meeting that Ohl denounced
the new employment peace
act as “an attempt to strangle labor”
and made the charges that the Heil
administration was “ fooling the farmer.”
The Kickapoo Valley Flood Control
association has by resolution asked
Governor Heil to call a special election
in the third congressional district to
fill the vacancy caused by the death of
Congressman Harry Griswold.
Boy Scouts
The Scout inter-patrol contest is
nearing its close. At the present, time
the Hawks are in first place, moving
up last week over the Flvine Eagles.
The Flaming Arrows held first place
for several weeks but dropped behind
However, the scores are too close to
make any predictions. Tt is still anybody’*
contest. How about it, bays?
On W’ednesday evenings we are having
Handicraft projects. The boys
are working on leather and linoleum
block projects under the guidance of
Franklin Smith. They also are making
bird feeders. Tt is a good time to
get some help on some of those tests
as the Scoutmaster and the Assistant
Scoutmaster are there to give you all
the help they can.
We have six new candidates for the
rank of Tenderfoot Scout, and T hope
in the next week or so we may have
an induction ceremony and make them
into full fledged Scouts.
Come up and visit us on Monday or
Wednesday evenings. You’ll find a
welcome.

TRUTH about ADVERTISING
_____________________By CHARLES B. ROTH
O H , FOR THE G O O D O LD DAYS
G r a n d p a b u t l e r was 84
when he died, but he held out
to the very last for what he affectionately
called “ the good old days.”
He liked to tell about them. Life
was simpler then, said he. We didn’t
hurry so fast. We
had more tim e to
read and to enjoy
our friends. And the
cost of living—say,
you could live for a
third of what it costs
a fellow these days
Where Grandpa
Butler’s logic fell
down was in confusing
the standards of
living when he was n
boy and when he was
an octogenarian.
When he was young you could
live for less—but you had less in
your life. You put up with discomforts
which would bo unthinkable today.
You ate unbalanced meals,
lived in uncomfortable homes, had
no radio sets, automobiles or electric
servants.
As a matter of fart—but we were
never able to convince Grandpa Butler
of It—the cost of living today,
dollar for dollar of value considered.
is far less than it was In his
young days.
Your dollar actually buys more,
brings you more value, than any
other dollar in history.
Anyone who understands simple
economics will tell you why. Two
words will do it. The words are
mass production.
Mass production is impossible
without mass distribution, which is
just another way of saying that when
a larger number of things are made
a large number of people must be
made to buy them.
There wasn’t any mass distribution
until advertising was developed,
and there wasn't any of the things in
our lives we call modern until advertising
put them there.
In many foreign countries even
today you have to spend weeks
scouring the markets for what you
want. Farm ers bring their cattle
and produce to market. They stay
in town two or three weeks disposing
of it. Consumers have to go
from stall to stall and dicker for
everything they want.
If you have the tim e and enjoy
trading, that sort of thing is fine,
is fun; but most of us have other
things to do. We find it simpler to
do our trading by reading the newspaper
advertisements, decide what
we will buy and then go down to the
store or telephone.
It saves time. It saves more. It
saves money. Without advertising
to smooth the route of goods from
seller to buyer, the cost of everything
is higher than when advertising
is in the picture.

Crowds Flock to Great Medicine ’
Sale at Local Drug Store.
The great sale of RUX Compound
still goes on, and each day the fame
of this remarkable medicine spreads
throughout Wittenberg and vicinity as
more and more people hear from the
lips of grateful users their amazing
stories of relief.
An Amazing Experience
RUX means so much to people, they
are anxious to express their happy
relief. Mrs. George Beck, Sr., longtime
resident of Appleton. Wisconsin,
rejoices:
“I am glad of this opportunity to
let others know of such a remarkable
medicine as RUX Compound and what
it has done for me. For some time I
have been suffering with Rheumatic
Pains in my knee and arm. Sometimes
the pains were very sharp and caused
me much distress. Often this trouble
interfered with my household duties.
“I started taking RUX and was soon
MRS. GEORGE BECK. SK.
surprised at the way it seemed to be
taking hold of my pain*. The pain
attacks became much milder. I was
able to do my work with greater ease
and also could get around better. I
am surely surprised and pleased with
the relief this medicine has given me.”

found out how much a driver makes
a day, what share the company
gets, whether the company is fair
to its employees, how long a cab
will last and so on. A week later
the head of that taxi company may
be asking for a loan and wonders
where John G raham ever learned
so much about his business.
“ In one way or another the average
business man comes in contact
with at least 50 people a week.
Most of us never think of asking

says “ Get Johnny,” when there is
a tough business problem to be
solved.

PUBLIC TREND
IS IMPORTANT
A G R E A T textile m anufacturing
business that once
employed 15,000 has been ordered
liquidated by a federal
judge. Thirty years ago it was
a leader in its field, a power in
the industrial world. Today it
is nothing but an assortment of
buildings and machinery to be
sold to the highest bidder.
As a ru le the cause of the
failure of many a business is
the inability of its management
to sense public trends,
to study the speed with which they
develop and then quickly adapt
products to these trends.
A large manufacturer of um brellas
foresaw the adverse effect of
closed automobiles on umbrella
sales. Sensing the great future
grow’th of aviation
the company
quickly dropped
out of the um brella
business,
and devoted its
entire efforts to
the manufacture
of parachutes.
Today it is a going
business.
When the automobile
business
was in its infancy the United States
was dotted with wagon and carriage
manufacturers, m any of them large
and well financed. Out of all of
them only one foresaw the trend
from horses to gasoline motors
clearly enough to see the advisability
of becoming an automobile
manufacturer. The rest have fallen
by the wayside.
Business men have been known
to get visions of the future from
small incidents. One of the financial
powers in the aviation business
was asked why he had dared risk
so much capital in the industry in
its early and hazardous days. “ I
just looked around at the youngsters
in my neighborhood and saw them
discarding fire engines and trains
for model airplanes,” he replied.
“ T hat’s when I became convinced
the aviation business had a great
future.”

(ras Masks Developed
For Horses and Mules
P A R IS —A gas mask has been
invented for horses and mules,
providing them with the same
protection now available to hum
an beings, cats and dogs.
The inventor, M. Loyer, started
with gas masks for cats and
dogs and worked up to masks for
horses and mules. The latter
were especially designed to be
quickly adjustable without frightening
their beneficiaries. They
serve also as Winders.
There’s something so social about
serving tea! Friends and neighbors
drop in for a bit of rest and relaxation,
conversation flourishes,
and the whole house is aglow with
hospitality.
Serving tea is one of the simplest
and most gracious ways of entertaining
— whether
you invite one
guest or fifty. It
m ay be a cozy,
informal affair
^ f with only a few
“ h a n d p i c k e d ”
friends invited,
and simple bread
and butter sandwiches, with a cup
of perfectly brewed tea for refreshments.
Or, you m ay plan a much
larger, more elaborate tea as a
means of entertaining the Parent-
Teacher association, the Garden
club, or perhaps the Women’s auxiliary
of your husband’s lodge.
F o rm al or informal, large or
small, you’ll find that beforehand
preparations and carefully laid
plans help to make this kind of entertaining
easy. A dm it the lim ita tions
of your budget, your equipment,
your tim e and strength, and
don’t plan more than you can carry
out comfortably and sensibly. Remember
that a cup of tea and a
slice of bread and butter can make
a party if the tea is perfectly made,
the bread enticingly thin, and the
service dainty and attractive.
Keep sandwiches, muffins, cakes
and cookies small and dainty. If
your invitation list numbers a large
number of guests, bake your favorite
cakes in jelly roll pans, frost,
and cut into small, diagonal pieces.
Ginger Cream Cakes.
To make these clever little cakes,
use the thin gingersnap or cookie
ordinarily sold on the market. Allow
from three to five to a serving.
Put together with sweetened
whipped cream in the same m anner
as in frosting a miniature layer
cake. Cover the top and sides generously
with the cream, and chill
thoroughly. Ground candied ginger
may be sprinkled sparingly over the
tops. One cup of whipping cream
will make six cakes.

freezing container of ice cream
freezer. Assemble and cover. Then
pack mixture of crushed ice and
rock salt (use three parts ice to one
part salt, by volume) around the
freezing container. Turn crank
slowly but steadily. When mixture
becomes too stiff to turn, remove
cover carefully, take out dasher,
and pack down evenly with a spoon.
Cover ice cream with wax paper
and replace cover. Repack. Cover
and allow to harden at least one
hour before serving.

H e l l o e v e r y b o d y :
You know they say troubles never come singly—which is
just another way of saying that Old Lady Adventure is never
content with giving you just one sock on the jaw. I don’t know
how true that is, but it certainly worked out that way in the case
of Hattie Rohr of Chicago.
Hattie’s big bout with Old Lady Adventure came in the winter
of 1917. There was trouble enough in the world then, without
having the old girl with the thrill bag on your neck. The
war was on and the influenza epidemic was sweeping the country.
Hattie, in those days, was just an eleven-year-old girl, living
with her mother and dad and three sisters on a farm between
Clare and Dodge City, Iowa. Her name then was Hattie
McLaughlin.
The flu epidemic struck the McLaughlin fam ily in J a n u ary.
It brought down Hattie’s dad and her three sisters, and
that left Hattie and her mother to do all the chores around
that big farm. It was one of those days when everything
seemed to go wrong. Mother had just come from upstairs to
call the doctor. Dad and the three sick girls were worse.
While they were waiting for the doctor the party-line phone
rang. It was the school teacher, down with the flu herself, who wanted
Hattie to go to the schoolhouse and post a notice saying there would be
no school that day
Already tired (rom her morning's work, Hattie struggled
more than a mile through the snow lo post that notice. She found
two small children shivering in the cold, waiting (or the school
to open, and took them to her home and phoned their (ather ts
come and get them. And no sooner had he rome and gone with
his pair o( kids than Hattie heard another knock on the door.
S t r a n g e r C o m e s In fo r T e a .
A strange man was out front. He said he was a telephone lineman
from Clare, and wanted to know if he could come in and get warm.
Hattie and her mother asked him in and gave him a cup of tea to warm
him up. While he was drinking his tea and e a tin ? a piece of corn

Wren Hail Last Lauiih
O n Critical Councillors
Sir Christopher Wren, builder of
St. P aul's cathedral, and many
other famous churches, was partly
responsible for the Town Hall
of Windsor, in 1686, but the good
councillors had misgivings about
his work.
They complained to him that the
big hall had no pillars to support
it, and despite Wren s assurances
that it had been designed that
way and was safe, demanded that
supporting pillars be placed in position.
W’ren agreed to do so, and had
four pillars erected. But some
years later it was discovered that
the pillars came one inch short of
reaching the ceiling.

bread, Hattie and her mother went on with their work. Nothing unusual
happened until he had finished eating and drinking. Then the stranger
got up and walked over to the stove.
It was such an unusual movement that Hattie stopped to watch him.
He backed up against the stove as if to warm himself, but Hattie saw
one of his hands slide into his pocket and come out holding a tiny bottle.
There was a pot of beans boiling on the stove. Slowly, shielded
by his body, the stranger’s hand crept up and emptied the contents
of the bottle into the pot of beans!
Her mother had n’d seen it, but Hattie was standing in such a position
that she could see every move he made. She was startled—frightened.
An older person might have said nothing, for fear of precipitating
trouble. That mother and child were defenseless, with dad ill in bed upstairs.
But kids of Hattie's age don’t stop to think of those things She
let out a scream and then, impulsively, she darted across the room and
knocked the bottle from the m a n ’s hand.
Out Comes a Long. Thin-BIadcd Knife.
Her mother turned to see what was the matter. At the same time,
the stranger reached inside his coat, pulled out a long, thin-bladed
knife, and slashed Hattie across the legs Blood began to flow from a
long deep cut. Dazed at the turn affairs had taken, Hattie backed
away, staring at the man. The man stood, knife in hand, staring back
at Hattie Her mother was staring at both of them. For a minute there
was a deathly silence.
The man made no other move—said nothing. Hattie and her mother
were too frightened to speak They began to realize the fellow was stark
mad Hattie sat down, took off a stocking and tied it about her wound.
The m an stood looking, first at her. then at her mother. He waited
until she was finished tying up her bleeding leg. and then he walked
across the room to where her mother was standing, breathless and paralyzed
with fright. AND R A IS E D THE K N IF E .
And again Hattie acted impulsively. In an instant she was out of
her chair and darting across the room. Reaching out quickly, rhe
grabbed the knife!
The man gave the knife a quick pull. It came out of Hattie's
hand, cutting it clear to the bone at the base of the thumb. Crying
out in pain, she grabbed at her wrist with her other hand.
The madman shoved her away, and knocked her mother down.
For another moment Hattie stood dazed. The man fell on her mother,
sat on her chest and began choking her. And at last, a sudden change
came over Hattie. Before, she had been frightened—trembling N w
she became furious. A red mist seemed to drop before her eyes. She
grabbed up a piece of wood from the pile beside the stove, raised it over
her head and brought it down, as hard as she could, on the m adm an's
head.
The man rolled over and lay still. Hattie s wrist was still
bleeding and her mother tied it up tightly to stop the flow. They
got ropes and tied the maniac's hands behind his back and the nwell—
then Ilattie keeled over in a dead faint.
When she came to, the doctor had been to the house. Jle had sewed
up Hattie's wounds and she had never known a thing about it. The doctor
also took the m adm an back to town and turned him over to the
police. They found out later that he had escaped from an institution
down in the South, where he hod been put for murder.
And when they analyzed that pot of beans into which he had emptied
that bottle, it was found that they were poisoned'

The lives of* 6,000 mothers could
be saved every year by prompt and
proper medical care, Dr Phillip R
Williams, of Philadelphia, said recently
at the first American Congress
of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
The maternal death rate in the
United States is lower than ever he
fore in history, but it is still "d is gracefully
high’’ in view of the pres-,
cnt knowledge of medical men. Dr
Williams said.
The death rate of mothers df*
jlined from 57 out of every 10,000
during 1936 to 49 out of every 10 000
in 1937 Dr Williams pointed out, j
however, that this might be cut in j
half if physicians made use of all i
available knowledge and if pros- j
pective mothers asked for med j
ical attention early
In addition, the lives of about half
of the babies who die in childbirth
or soon after might be saved hy
application of medical methods
which are not now generally ap
plied During 1937, the last year
for which statistics are availal ie
119,931 babies died.
