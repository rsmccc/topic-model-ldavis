E ASE FARM DEBTS
(State Journal Washington Bureau)
Washington A t the request of the
Farm Union and other agricultural
groups Rep Merlin H ull (P Black
River Falls) has introduced in the
house a companion bill to the Farm
Debt Adjustment act o f Sen Burton
K Wheeler (D Mont ) 
The bill provides for a farm debt
adjustmest committee to be set up in
each county in which there is need
for one the committee to be composed
o f three residents of the county 
paid not more than 3 a day while
they are meeting 
This committee is to arbitrate between
farm debtors and their creditors 
without charge whenever its
services are required When the government
is the creditor the committee s
recommendations must be approved
by the secretary o f agriculture 
Designed primarily to enable disposed
farmers to re-purchase their
land of Federal Land Banks the bill
entitles any farmer whose mortgages
has been foreclosed by any Federal
land bank or by the Federal Farm
Mortgage Corp to file a grievance
application with the adjustment committee 
which can then certify the aplication
to the secretary 
When investigation has been made
and the secretary approves the application 
i f the land is held by the
FFMC and has not been sold the former
owner will receive a lease and
purchase contract on the farm I f
the land is held by a Federal land
bank it is to be sold to the FFMC
and thus leased to the farmer on a
purchase contract 
A fter a five-year lease on terms 
to be decided in each case either cash
or crop the farmer may buy the land 
getting credit for the rent he has
paid with a 40-year first mortgage
or deed o f trust to the corporation 
The bill also provides for the refinancing
of delinquent mortgages 
when the indebted farmer has been in
default for three years and can prove
that the mortgage indebtedness was
greater than the farm s value The
bill applies particularly to Farm Land
Bank mortgages 
H EA P TEPE E TALK
By Red Cloud
Do not say Fourth o f J u ly say
instead Centennial and homecoming 
 
Indians never run when a shower
catches up with them They never
run during a storm no matter how
hard it rains It is strictly against
their belief When a person runs he
runs into more raindrops than if he
walks so it s better to go slow 
The horse-flies went crazy with the
heat the last few days and couldn t
tell the difference between a horse
and a cow and cows had a hard time
of it-
I t takes a jack to raise a car and
it also takes jack to raise a family 
A couple of weeks back a bit of
Smoke Signals appeared in the
Cookie Jar W ill wonders never
cease Vacation with pay even for
a day sounds alright on paper and
mothers may believe in it in theory 
in actual practice nothing doing 
Even if mothers did receive pay 
it s more than likely they d buy things
for their children 
But for fathers they are very much
against it in theory They think it
is an extreme new deal policy In
actual practice they are fo r it heart
and soul and will use the pay to
buy more fishing tackle 
I didn t think the Heap Tepee
Talk was read by such distfhguished
people Thanks just the same Marcella 
The thunder showers o f last week
were said to be million dollar rain
storms I can t say that I know any
about a million dollar rain As far
as I am concerned there can be only
forty dollar rains That s the biggest
amount o f money I know anything
about 
May we all meet happily at the
Centennial and Homecoming

Death waited around the next
curve for several Wisconsin motorists
this month 
Several fatal accident reports received
by the State Highway commission
this month show that the car was
being driven at an excessive speed
just before it left the highway on a
curve and came to a crashing stop 
Curves are plainly marked with arrow
signs these warning markers being
yellow and black and diamond shape 
Elmer Davis o f Charter Oak Mill 
went fishing at Hatfield recently and
had an encounter with a rattlesnake
that took his mind off fishing for a
time He left his car just after crossing
the high iron bridge and walked
up a road toward the canal He heard
a peculiar noise which was foreign
to the surroundings and caused him
concern Not more than two feet
away was the rattlesnake coiled with
its head and tail up and the tail vibrating
as it rattled It struck viciously
at a stick and showed no disposition
to run away Mr Davis succeeded
in killing it It was the first
time he had seen a rattler and as
we said before it succeeded in taking
his mind off the pleasures of fishing

COOP N EWS
The 13th annual meeting of the
Midland Cooperative Wholesale was
held at Minneapolis Monday and
Tuesday o f last week June 12th and
13 th-
The meeting Monday was devoted
to Cooperative education where the
delegates of the 120 Coop study clubs
of two states Wisconsin and Minnesota 
met and discussed means and
methods o f spreading the teaching of
cooperation This meeting was followed
by a banquet in the West Hotel 
Mr Smoots manager o f U nited
Cooperatives Inc was the speaker
and the remainder of the evening
was spent in dancing 
Tuesday the meeting was devoted
to the business of the wholesale seating
o f the directors and disposal of
such other business that usually
comes before a cooperative o f this
kind 
During the last year Midland earned
a net profit of 84 701 00 which
was unanimously voted to be left in
the Wholesale to go toward paying
off its indebtedness and to promote
further expansion This policy has
been adhered to since Midland was
started with one exception 
One o f the ways in which Midland
will expand is the establishing of
Coop grocery stores Nine stores
have already been started and this
coming year greater progress will be
made along this line 
The question is often asked who is
or owns Midland the answer is that
the Local Coop Oil Association own
and control Midland which are in turn
owned and controlled by its stockholders 
Those attending the meeting from
Jackson county were Mr and Mrs 
Tom Stodola Richard Faldet Robert
Flugstad Mr and Mrs Grant Graebel 
J W and Earl Horswill James
Bullock Mrs George Martin and
Leonard Drescher- Mike Filkowsky 
Gladys Ekern Miss Lakey and Fred

(B y E arl Horswill)
The Anti-cooperative bill sponsored
by the Wisconsin Chamber of
Commerce to prohibit the teaching
of cooperation in our public schools 
was brought before the educational
committee last Wednesday 
Those appearing against the bill
were representatives of the Wisconsin
Counsel o f Agriculture Midland
Cooperative Kenneth Hones President
o f Farmers Equity Union Farmers
Union Ju n io r group in a body 
the Agricultural teacher o f Whitewater
Teachers College and others 
One of the arguments put forth for
the bill was to safeguard our Democracy 
 to which Kenneth Hones
replied The strongest Democracies
in the world today are those where
cooperation is taught and practiced 
This proposed law is perhaps the
most detrimental and far reaching of
any bill introduced into this session
of our Legislature I f the Chamber
o f Commerce is to be allowed to dictate
to our Legislature as to what is
and what is not to be taught in our
public schools we can ask ourselves
with all sincerity the same question 
 Is Our Democracy Safe 
On Tuesday o f this week representatives
of many o f the regional wholesales
of the U S and Canada will
meet at Authurdale West Virginia 
to take part in the dedication of the
new co-op farm machinery plant 
No new Co-op tractors have been
sold in Wisconsin but large shipments
have been made to western Canada
and are ready to do their part in the
wheat harvest 
SEVENTY A C R ES R E JU V IN A T E D
Seventy five acres of worn-out and
overgrazed permanent bluegrass pastures
were given new life this spring
in the Camp Irving demonstrational
area according to J D Zellinger local
agronomist for the Soil Conservation
Service 
 Because these pastures had thin
sods and were weakened by overgrazing
and low fertility they had lost
much of their effectiveness as a
means of erosion control Also their
productivity has been low Zellinger
says 
The renovation o f such pastures
was established by seeding dryweather
legumes such as alfalfa 
sweet clover and red clover in thin
bluegrass sods In place o f plowing 
the pastures were disked and cultivated
to permit seeding of legumes
without serious hazards o f erosion 
Deficiencies in soil fertility as indicated
by soil tests were remedied
by applying proper amounts of lime
and fertilizer 
To permit the legumes to restore
these areas to good pastures it will
be necessary to exclude grazing in
the summer months the agronomist
explained Limited grazing is sometimes
pemitted in the early fall 
Once established in bluegrass the
legume repel the egg-laying June
beetle which produces the white grub 
eliminate weeds and furnish nitrogen
to promote grass growth They 
also increase the production o f pasture
by supplying growth when the
bluegrass becomes dry and tough
from the summer droughts Zellinger
says

Crown Prince Olav and Crown
Princess Martha of Norway were an
important attraction in Madison 
Apparently they made a very fa vorable
impression on all who had an
opportunity to see them I was impressed
by Olav s statement that he
did not come to the United States to
bring about a friendly feeling for
such a feeling has always existed

Teachers tenure hereafter will not
apply to teachers in one room schools 
but in all other schools the law will
remain in effect even as it pertains
to married women The legislature
again refused to discriminate against
married women as they did in the
Fitzsimmons Bill 
With reference to the new proposed
tax law that will have its first
hearing on June 29th and in reply
to the letters and telegrams that I
received there on will state that most
o f the proposed sales tax features
have been withdrawn including the
theatre tax And as a substitute for
such withdrawals they propose to
take out o f the Auto license and gas
tax fund 7 500 000-00 for the biannium 
Several years ago the legislature
passed a law making all income tax
report a matter o f public record A n
attempt to repeal this law was given
consideration last week but was finally
defeated by a close vote 
The reorganization o f the state departments
is still in progress however
the reorganization of the State Highway
Commission and the Farm Home
and Credit Administration were
blocked by a very close margin However
the vote on final passage is in
doubt 
The general fishing license law
which applies only to male persons
between the age of 18 and 65 was
ingrossed in th eassembly and will
probably pass however other changes
may be made in the senate

Note to Contestants Help to see
that all votes have an identification
stamp on them The new tickets have
 Centennial printed across the face

Buy Tickets Now from girls in
the Centennial Queen contest 
Tickets count 10 votes 
Attention is again called to the
conditions o f the Queen contest published
on the big cards The preliminary
contest finished last Saturday 
entitled the contestants with the largest
number of votes to their credit
to a place in the final contest 
In the final contest the Queen will
be determined by judges F ifty per-
The Floats and Parade
There will be floats from throughout
the county and many from here
for the big Century o f Progress parade 
which will be held at 11 a m 
Monday Ju ly 3rd and a t 1 0 30 a m 
Tuesday Ju ly 4th The committee in
charge plans to have the floats arranged
so those representing the earliest
periods of time will be first and
those representing more recent developments
come later in the line 
The parade will form at the Northwestern
depot at Black River Falls
and will proceed across the bridge 
up Main street and directly to the
fa ir grounds where space will be provided
for the parade floats to line up
and remain on exhibit as long as the
drivers care to have them Arrangements
have been made to use the
county barns at the fa ir grounds and
the county garage for parking the
floats over night I f floats are made
of material that wind and rain may
easily spoil it would be well to take
advantage of this arrangement 
The parade committee Bert F 
Johnson chairman Ubbe Anderson
and C S Ristow will appreciate being
informed o f what the floats will
be 
Queen Contest
The Queen contest is under way
again with eliminations complete except
for the eight candidates high in
Black River Falls and one for each
250 population or major fraction
thereof fo r each town and village in
the county The original plan o f the
contest as developed started each one
on an equal basis after nomination 
Each remaining contestant was given
an equal proportion to start With
the other factors operating in the
final elimination the judges are confident
the first second and third
Queens will be fairly and accurately
chosen- W in or lose the hope is that
all contestants will play the game of
a good sport and receive the honors
in the same spirit in which they are
given 
Safety
W ith all that is heard on the air
and in the papers on safety these days
there is little left to be said All
who visit the Centennial are asked to
exercise care and thought of safety
in every way possible I t will be another
case of applying the Golden
Rule Those in charge will be happy
if the record can be not an accident
in three days

GIAN T C O L L E G IA N S CUT DOWN
TO R U D O L P H S S IZE 4 TO 3
For a few minutes last Sunday
night Jackson county baseball fans
could have spotted Mendota a fruit
cake or two and still come out a bag
or two of pecans ahead of the psychopathies 
It all came about in the 10th
inning o f the ball game at the fa ir
grounds which about 1500 goggleeyed
bugs witnessed A rt Rudolph
was responsible for it The Merchant
cleaner upper had had a large evening
with the stick already having
collected a pair of hits along with a
stolen base and a very valuable run
batted in The folks hardly expected
A rt to perform more heroic so
when he lashed a line single into
right that sent Kleven home with the
game winning run a mighty as well as
spontaneous hulabaloo burst upon the
night air A ll 1500 o f em went absolutely
blah Up until the moment
of that hit one o f the greatest ball
games ever unraveled here had kept
the people on the very edge o f their
seats and only after the toughest kind
o f an uphill battle were the locals
able to tie the score in the 8th But
we ll start from the beginning 
The colored visitors gained a lap
on the home boys in the first when
Tyler larruped a long double to left
center to count Popeye who had opened
up the ceremony with a single 
Two more counted in the third but
both were runs soiled and came about
on a three base wild throw after a
single That made three runs down
because even tho they were besmirched
they counted in the scorebook 
and a three run handicap
against the Piney Woods boys means
that to win is to do it the hard way 
The Merchant men were as calm
and peaceful as a contented milk producer
until the 4th nary a hit being
corraled during the first three chapters 
Then Teeples beat out a slow
roller A moment later the pitcher
was being told by the catcher dont
look now b t that fellow is stealing
second base That guy Teeples could
spot a jackrabbit a handicap and kick
cobblestones in his face A rt picked
this spot for his first gallant gesture
and slapped the ball into right to
shorten the score to 3 to 1 A rt went
in for base burglary and was at second
when E Rudolph crashed a hit
into left Mr A Rudolph of course 
counted on the bingle 
The tally stayed at 3 to 2 until
the 8th when a tie was set up in this
fashion Teeples pasted a hard one
right on the nose for a sizzling hit 
A rt sent him to third with a second
hit to right Ernie gave the boys the
signal for the double steal and the
colored folks were going to outsmart
the boys by shooting the pellet to the
short stop who had come in for the
trickery In this strategy there was
the slight oversight that Bob goes
over the geography with great rapidity 
so when the ball was shot back
to the plate the tying run had already
come home amid great cheering 
That set the stage for what happened
in the extra inning In finer
detail it happened like this Kleven
lined a hit to center and proceeded to
do the bandit act on base number 2 
Then A rt hit the ball and the fans
went gaga and home 
Really there were fo ur boys who
had a hand in the run getting glory 
viz A Rudolph Teeples E Rudolph
and Kleven Among them they made
the great bass look Like a fish looting
a total of six bags and every one of
the thefts played an important part
in the payoff 
Rude s hurling job deserves a little
separate mention on account of certain
statistics that developed during
his evening s work Ernie had hurlley

JA C O B SPAU LDIN G FOU N D ER
O F B LA C K R IV E R FALLS
Jacob Spaulding came here in 1839
and was one o f the founders of the
first permanent settlement on Black
river His twin granddaughters the
Misses Mary and Jane Spaulding are
the only members of the family residing
here They retain their residence
in the beautiful home in the west end
o f town which was built by their
father the late D J Spaulding A n other
sister Mrs Sadie Castle lives
in Chicago 
Last week their grand-niece Mrs 
Clyde I Bowman of Portland Oregon 
sent the Misses Spaulding a copy
of the two articles published below 
which she found in the scrap-book of
her grandmother the late Mrs Ju lia
Spaulding Osborn whcih she had taken
west with her in April They were
taken from the Milwaukee Sentinel 
Death of Hon Jacob Spaulding
(Correspondence o f The Sentinel)
Black River Falls Jan 26 1875 
Last evening the body o f Hon Jacob
Spaulding was brought to his home
by special train kindly furnished
friends by the West Wisconsin R ailway 
Mr Spaulding left his home
only a day or two before his death
in not very good health to meet an
engagement he had made at Worcester 
the end of the Wisconsin Central 
On retiring to his bed he complained
of pain in his head - - the
next day at 1 o clock Sunday he
expired without a struggle Mr 
Spaulding came to what is now Black
River Falls in the spring of 1839 
thirty-six years ago and was the
founder of our village and has resided
here ever since doing much to
aid in the growth and prosperity of
this and Clark County Jennie his
daughter the wife o f S P Jones 
one of the leading merchants of our
place was said to be the first white
child born on Black River 
Some two years ago the Winnebago
Indians long residents of this
county were removed to their reservation
in Nebraska Staying there
only for a short time the climate not
agreeing with them some 300 returned
to this place and engaged the
services of Mr Spaulding to procure
from the Government certain rights
they had forfeited by not staying on
their reservation During the past
two years Mr Spaulding has devoted
all his time to the interest o f the
Winnebagoes who owe him an everlasting
debt of gratitude for his untiring
efforts in their behalf- He has
made several trips to Washington for
them and been very successful in securing
for them all they ask He has
selected homesteads under the Homestead
law fo r over eighty families
who have all abandoned their tribal
relations throwing off their garbs
as Indians and assuming the garbs of
civilization and becoming citizens under
the law securing to them the
annuities due them from the United
States not failin g to impress upon
their minds principles o f industry and
sobriety as elements necessary for
their success in civilized life The
death of Mr Spaulding has caused a
deep gloom to overshadow the minds
o f these lately made citizens They
feel in this they have lost more than
father a true friend - - who had
sacrificed much for their elevation
and done all for them without pay
or reward Some thirty years ago
some of these Indians saved Mr 
Spaulding s life on two occasions 
This Mr Spaulding never forgot He
has now paid the debt giving his life
to their interest No doubt his death
was brought about by extraordinary
labor and over-taxation o f the mind 
Living over thirty-five years in this
place Mr S had no bitter enemies 
He was kind and affable to all A
man with a big heart sharing his last
dollar if need be to the comfort and
well-being of his friends Many mourn
his death and feel that our town has
lost a valuable citizen one that we
could ill spare His funeral will take
place tomorrow at Freeman Hall under
the auspices o f the Masonic lodge
of which Mr Spaulding was a valuable
member A ll our business houses
will be closed during the services- Mr 
Spaulding was about 65 years o f age 
He leaves a son and two daughters 
His son D J Spaulding is one of the
large lumbermen and probably the
wealthiest man in Black River Valley 
Jennie married S P Jones a
merchant The youngest Lorraine 
married a Mr Durham now residing
at Unity Clark county 
Funeral of Jacob Spaulding
(Correspondence of The Sentinel)
Black River Falls Jan 28 1875 
Yesterday the body of the late Jacob
Spaulding pioneer settler o f Northwestern
Wisconsin was conveyed to
its last resting place and interred under
the peculiarly impressive ceremonies
o f the Masonic order o f which
he had been a member for many
years Freeman s Hall where the
purely religious funeral ceremonies
were conducted by the Rev J M 
Gatchell Universalist minister whose
church the deceased had attended assisted
by all the other resident clergymen 
was packed to its utmost capacity 
and it was estimated that 1 000
people found room to sit or stand in
it while as many more were unable
to gain admittance 
A very interesting feature of the
occasion was the presence of about
forty male Winnebago Indians who
occupied a prominent position in the
hall under the immediate supervision
of John St Cyr their interpreter 
and outside of the immediate family
circle of the deceased they were
probably as sincere mourners as any
present for in the early settlement
days the life o f the deceased was saved
by individuals o f the tribe and
ever after until death so suddenly

overtook him through good and evil
report Mr Spaulding was their steadfact
friend in fact he fed them
when hungry and clothed them when
naked and it was remarked that when
they passed to take a last look o f all
that was mortal of their great white
chief the rigid muscles in many of
their faces relaxed and they came
near exhibiting signs of weakness so
contrary to the nature and education
of an Indian in presence of the
whites 
The address of the eloquent preacher
was founded upon the words I f
a man die shall he live again and
was listened to with breathless attention
by his thousand hearers while
his closing words to the Indians
(many of whom could understand
him ) the members o f the Masonic
fraternity present friends and immediate
relatives were touching and
very appropriate-
The procession to the cemetery was
the most imposing ever witnessed in
our village The village silver comet
band furnished grand music The In dians
were in the advance in two
ranks and marched in perfect trim 
They were followed by the band then
came the Order of F A M then
followed the hearse with relatives
and friends in the rear making altogether
a procession nearly a half-mile
long 
A t the grave the ceremonies of
the Order were under the immediate
direction of W S Darrow Esq P 
M whose rendition of the Masonic
burial service may be equaled but
cannot be excelled in the solemn utterance
o f the grand sentiments embodied
in the ritual o f the Order 
The other ceremonies being completed 
the Hon C C Pope reported
from the committee appropriate lodge
resolutions and with the adoption of
them closed the funeral ceremonies
of the best-known man of our section 
and who was identified to a
greater or less extent with all the material
interests of our section since
his settlement of it in 1839

This is the second o f a series of
historical articles on Jackson county 
written from the period o f 1839 to
1854 when Jackson was still a part
of Crawford county We are indebted
to Mrs N E Gallagher of 39 East

for the series It would be a good
idea for the schools of the county to
clip the articles and preserve them in
a scrapbook as a permanent record of

No one of the small party thus
landing at the Falls probably surmised
that it was a nucleus around which
would be in comparatively a few
years gathered 12 000 people now
composing the population o f Jackson
and Clark counties or that any of
that party would survive to see magnificent
blocks of brick buildings
springing up or hear the shrill whistle
o f the locomotive that great
harbinger of business and progress 
within a stone s throw of the wild
spot they had reached 
But they knew positively that they
were over one hundred miles from
any white settlement that the whole
vast country around them was a wilderness 
that they were surrounded
by treacherous natives on every side 
who would look upon them with jealous
eyes as intruders upon their
choicest hunting grounds that they
were away beyond the verge o f civilization 
and that the life before them
was one of toil hardship danger and
privation 
Brave men were they and such as
they have opened up the wilderness
of thirty years ago so that today it
blossoms as the rose and its inhabitants
are as highly favored with social 
educational and religious advantages
as are the denizens o f the original
thirteen States 
Our adventurers immediately on
their arrival commenced and soon
after completed a double log cabin 
located on the South bank of Town
Creek North and a little East o f the
present site o f the Spaulding block on
Water street 
That done the party commenced
getting out timber for the frame o f a
small saw mill which was erected the
following season on Town Creek very
near the point where the bridge now
spans it 
About that time Spaulding A n drew
Wood Joseph Stickney and H iram
Yeatman started down the river
in a canoe and upon arriving at Prairie
du Chien Stickney and Yateman
disembarked and did not return to
Black River for a number of years
after Spaulding and Wood however 
kept on down the river to Warsaw 
111 and there purchased the necessary
irons and machinery for their propos
ed saw mill at the Falls From thence
Wood returned to his old home at
Quincy 111 to remain until the following
spring Spaulding in charge
of the material was fortunate enough
to get it conveyed by the only steamboat
that traveled the Upper Mississippi 
on its second and last trip for
the season to and landed at Prairie
du Chien 
He then hastened back to the Falls
for the boat hereinbefore described
with a crew to transport the machinery
and supplies to be purchased but
upon reaching that place he learned
that a party o f Indians which had
been hunting in the neighborhood 
having been successful in securing a
large quantity of game had before
his arrival taken the boat which at
the time was tied up some distance
below the Falls without license and
having loaded it with a large number
of elk bear and deer had started
with it down the river Spaulding
gave chase and succeeded in finding
his boat minus Indians at a point a
short distance this side of Decorah s
Village and as soon as possible he
got together a crew and started down
after his goods Reaching Prairie du
Chien he took them aboard as winter
was close at hand Reaching Winneshiek 
now in Vernon county his boat
was frozen in hard and fast-
Finding winter was upon him in
earnest he with a crew started on
foot by the way of the river for the
Falls a distance of 140 miles A rriving
safely about the first of Ja n u ary 
1840 he immediately set to work
preparing teams for a trip to the
boat Fifteen of what in those days
were called moose sleds were hastily
constructed calculated for a single
ox as a team having thills tied
to the single yoke I t was found that
a team of that description would haul
1 500 lbs freight on the ice 
Everything being in readiness 
Spaulding with his moose train 
o f fifteen oxen started down on the
ice for Winneshiek arriving there
about the middle o f January and reshipping
his goods from the boat 
started back Spaulding acting pilot
on the ice ahead of the team as there
W IN N E B A G O SQUAWS RESTING
A familiar scene on the streets o f Black River Falls
during the late part o f last century and early part o f
this one 
C APTAIN C A LV IN R JO HN SON
Captain Johnson father of the late
Judge Frank Johnson and of Mrs 
Laura Campbell of this city came
here in 1846 from Massachusetts He
was the first school teacher here in
the spring o f 1847 He left a valuable
history of the early days o f the
county He served in the Mexican
war and was made a captain of Company
I 14th Wisconsin Volunteer
Infantry 
was very peculiar ice that winter 
defective and sound so joined on the
surface that it took experienced eyes
to distinguish one class from the
other The most careful supervision
did not save men and teams from involuntary
cold baths in Mississippi
River water 
The party however arrived at the
Falls without loss except now and
then a man lost his temper as he unwittingly
slumped through the ice into
the river water with the thermometer
at 30 degrees below I t is said
that some very good men of that party
swore like troopers at their mishaps
in the line o f accidents 
The claim that Spaulding and the
Woods made upon arriving at the
Falls was not run-out with a compass 
but it appeared that they understood
it to include the water power
at that point and all the land adjoining
on either side of the river 
Shortly after the return of Spaulding
and his moose train from below 
the Chief old Menomonie with a
party of thirty or forty Indians arrived
at the Falls with the expressed
purpose of forcing the whites to evacuate
the country supposing that they
were not advised of a late treaty
whereby the Indians had ceded to
Government all their rights to it 
The Indians remained several days
living off the whites and making a
few purchases but finally demanded 
peremtorily to know of Spaulding
whether he and the others intended to
go peaceably or otherwise 
I f the old Chief and his braves had
at the time been better and more intimately
acquainted with the man of
whom they made the demand they
might have known that he never moved
very fast in a direction that he
disliked to take but that being their
first introduction they very naturally
supposed that they had their man
considerably frightened 
Spaulding however had made up
his mind to stay and that instead of
his going the Indians should git 
managed to get all the Indians into
one part o f his double cabin then had
his seventeen men by ones and two
get into the other where all their
arms were and soon every white man
was armed and ready for a fight 
The Indians in the meantime were
in blissful ignorance of the good
time coming supposing everything
to be lovely when patiently waiting
for Spaulding s reply to their ultimatum 
It came in the shape of Spaulding
with seventeen rifles at his back 
who in a moment had them surrounded
and at his mercy Calling them
out he then ordered them to leave 
and be quick about it too never to
B LA C K H AW K
He was jo in t chief of the Winnebagoes
with Winneshiek He never
possessed much influence with the
tribe Winneshiek being the ruling
spirit during their join t reign He
died about 1899 and Winneshiek a
few years earlier 
BETSY THUNDER
A famous Winnebago squaw nurse
held in high esteem by both Indians
and whites 
return on a similar errand and they
left 
Thenceforward old Menomonie was 
until his death a fast friend of
Spaulding s probably having at their
first introduction discovered a few
obstinate traits in his character that
he loved

This is the season when cooks get
gray trying to plan varied menus 
The winter s supply o f canned vegetables
is exhausted and garden stuffs
aren t quite ready to use so cooking
really becomes a problem Lima beans
offer one solution Soaked over night
and then cooked until tender they
are delicious served just with cream
and seasoning Baked like regular
beans with molasses brown sugar and
bacon they make a welcome addition
to any meal Here are two other
lima bean recipes you might like to
try 
Lima and Ham Loaf
1 cup cooked lima beans
 cup ground ham
M cup chili sauce or catsup
2 eggs beaten
1 tsp minced onion
1 tbsp melted butter
1 cup cracker crumbs
Salt and pepper
Rub beans through a coarse strainer 
Add ham catsup eggs and other
ingredients and shape into a loaf 
Place in a buttered pan and bake 30
minutes in a moderate oven basting
occasionally with belted butter-
Lima Beans with Sausage
1 cup lima beans
 lb sausage
1 medium onion
1 cup tomatoes
 tsp chili powder
 tsp salt
Fry onions and sausage until done 
add other ingredients and simmer 30
minutes 
Did you ever try sprinkling coconut
over the top of cake batter just
before putting the pan in the oven 
It gives the cake a delightfully toasted
taste and saves the bother of making
frosting 
Line a baking dish with a thick
layer of graham cracker crumbs 
Make your favorite cornstarch or
custard pudding and pour over the
cracker crumbs Cover with more
crumbs then bake a few minutes in
the oven and you ll have a satisfying
and easily prepared dessert 
How about making jello in paper
cups Just dip them in hot water to
unmold 
I f you use glass sippers for cold
drinks and find them difficult to
wash try using pipe cleaners 
And if you have a new recipe or
an old favorite please send it to the
Cookie Jar which is getting alarmingly
empty 
Here is a Betty Crocker recipe
which I found interesting because o f
the way in which the tart shells are
prepared 
Butterscotch Tarts
1M cups flour
 tsp salt
cup shortening
3 to 4 tbsp ice water
2 tbsp butter
Mix flour and salt cut lard in thoroughly 
Sprinkle ice water on a few
drops at a time and pinch into little
balls until all flour is mixed with water 
Roll out fairly thin and dot with
1 tbsp butter Fold three times and
roll again Dot with 2nd tbsp- butter 
fold three times and roll again Cut
rounds fit into tart shells and bake
quickly For especially tender shells 
allow the dough to stand in the refrigerator
for a while before baking 
F illin g 
1 cup brown sugar
h i cup flour
1A tsp salt
1 cup scalded milk
1 egg
2 tbsp butter
1 tsp vanilla
1M cups whipping cream
1 tbsp powdered sugar
Prepare as you would a custard or
cornstarch pudding Allow to cool 
then add h a lf of the cream which has
been sweetened with the powdered sugar 
Fill tart shells and spread remaining
cream on the top 
Nearly 700 creamery and dairy

COUNTY AGENT NOTES
Poultry Hints
 Now if ever come culling days 
This is the month to really go over
the flock Remove all hens that have
been persistently broody those showin
g yellow color in beak and shanks 
those starting to molt and not laying 
The removal of just those
classes will help immensely in reducing
the feed bill improving average
production and improving feed
cost per dozen 
The market price on such hens is
about is high as may be expected 
One should not however be expected
to sell them all Some of those hens
that have regained body weight make
the finest canned chicken- In fact 
it may be advisable to put some of
them in semi-confinement on a fa ttening
ration o f shelled corn and
milk for a short time before killing 
A plum hen in a quart ja r is worth
more than 11c per pound 
Now s the time for feeding a moist
mash Moisten the regular mash with
milk or water to a crumbly condition 
Feed an amount at noon that the
flock will clean up in 10 to 15 minutes 
It is a cool palatable feed and
results in an increased consumption
of mash Continue the feeding of dry
mash in hoppers during the entire
summer This moist mash is merely
a supplement to the regular feeding
program during Ju ly and August 
How about lice and mites Some
good wood preserving material should
be painted on the roosts and nests It
prevents the mill eggs from hatching
and controls the mites Apply
during the forenoon Apply a nicotine
product such as Black Leaf 40 
to the roosts in small amounts in the
late afternoon to control lice

There is one figure in the county
report for 1938 that is considered as
bad news to those interested in building
up our Jackson county soils Officials
of the A A A report that 8 -
048 08 that was available to aid participating
farmers in Jackson county
in seeding liming fertilization and
other soil building practices was lost
because some farmers failed to carry
out the necessary practices On a
great many farms it is said there
were no soil building practices carried
out and hence the entire soil building
allowance for such farms was lost 
In 1939 there will be approximately
 37 650 available in the county as
assistance in the soil building program-
A ll farm operators and farm
owners are being urged to make every
effort to qualify for their maximum
soil building payment by carrying out
sufficient practices 
The principal practices listed as
qualifying for payment a re (1 ) applications
of ground limestone marl
or other substitutes for limestone!
(1 ) seedings o f practically all biennial
and perennial grasses and legumes 
(3 ) pasture improvement by
reseeding or by non-grazing until a fter
seed ripens (4 ) erosion control
practices of constructing terraces 
soil and water saving dams and reservoirs 
strip cropping and contour
planting and cultivation and (5 )
planting trees for windbreak shelterbelts
or forests 
For further information on soil
building practices or earnings for carrying
them out local farmers are being
asked to see local conservation

M E RLIN H U L L S LETTER
When and if the correspondence of
our State department with Japan the
past two years is ever published it
will fill volumes During that period
Japan frequently has been offering
what only a few years ago would
have been regarded as a cause for
war It has bombed our ships killed
our citizens in China destroyed our
treaty rights and in almost every
conceivable manner has seemed to
prove to its owm countrymen and
other Asiatics that our nation may be
insulted with impunity Each incident
entails voluminous protests from our
Department o f State and usually
brings a formal apology from the J a panese
government B ut the controlled
press of Japan never mentions
the apology so that the people of
that country are led to believe that
the great U S A is so afraid o f J a panese
war power that it accepts the
affronts and waits only to see what
their war-lords may next impose upon
us 
Years ago the British government
proposed to infringe upon our Monroe
Doctrine by an asasult on Venezuela 
The usual diplomatic correspondence
followed while Britain
gave us no satisfaction Grover Cleveland
was president and he tired of
the evasive replies He dispatched a
short curt note which had more of
plain meaning that of diplomacy In
brief it was a notice to Britain to
 get out stay out or fight It got
out forthwith and it stayed out From
that day on Britain has not taken a
step which would infringe upon our
rights or privileges in any part o f the
world O f course Grover Cleveland
has been dead these many years and
the world is different now 
The soft-pillowed diplomacy designed
to promote world peace and
foreign trade in these modern days
may be wiser and better than the
Clevenland kind Forbearance may be
a virtue worthy o f respect How
fa r it should be respected may become
a greater question Japan continues
to finance its war with China 
and its preparations for war with us
later on through its sales o f silk
and other commodities to this coun
try and buys the larger part of its
war materials of us But for our oil 
scrap-iron cotton plane parts the
Japan war machine would be ready
for the jun k pile in six months All
this adds to the profits of our foreign
trade It makes the people of Japan
believe the story o f its war-makers 
that this country is afraid to fight 
and is backing Japan in its conquests 
It doesn t make our people any too
comfortable to be regarded as so
feeble or unprincipled 
Recently our State department
sent Japan what appears to have been
a stronger sharper note than usual 
but nobody knows what it said not
even Congress The State department
requested the Japanese government
to consent that the note might be
published fo r the information of our
own people but it does not consent 
So our State department has appealed
to the Emperor of Japan for his consent
to the publication The emperor
does not deign the courtesy o f a
reply Perhaps he is too busy One
could scarcely imagine Grover Cleveland
asking the King of England for
his consent to publish his message on
the Venezuelan question In fact he
published it the moment it was sent 
But those were other and different
times We hadn t much trade with
Japan then And an American citizen
was as safe in Japan or China as he
was in our own country and Japan
wasn t blowing up American ships 
stealing our seals and salmon or
abrogating our priivleges in any
country 
The House put on a show for
the crowded galleries when the relief
bill came up Even though the committee
required seven weeks in formulating
the measure little was known
as to its provisions extravagances
and economies until it was brought
in The House was held in session
14 hours and until an early hour
in the morning as the leaders resortin
g to all the gag rules and motions
well-known to House procedure 
sought to force passage without
amendment 
As the hours wore on the usual
hubbub o f the greatest deliberative
body in the world increased to riotous
proportions The presiding o fficer
appealed for better order in
vain So great was the confusion that
even with the loud-speaker system 
but little could be heard of the debate 
and only a few members could
hear amendments read In the main 
nearly all amendments offered were
voted down with a roar with many
not even knowing the real purpose
of the amendments The galleries
were filled until long after midnight
with crowds which flocked in to escape
the intense heat outside and to
witness representative government 
in action 
The leaders who controlled the
time allowed for debate were severe
in their restrictions o f time when
provisions came up to permit farmers
to share in the relief program 
O nly 15 minutes were allowed 12
members to protest the economy o f
a fifty-two million reduction in the
loan funds of the Farm Security Administration 
used solely for rehabilitation
of farmers who have lost their
farms from foreclosures and for other
reasons A provision was easily
carried to add another fifty millions
from relief funds to an equal amount
already provided for flood control 
The leaders seemed to think that one
hundred millions for flood control
would not twist the budget farther
out o f shape like loaning 100 000
down-and-out farmers h alf as much
to keep them from going to town to
get work on the WPA 
Thus far the Farm Security Administration
has been the most successful
government loaning agency 
In fo ur years it has loaned to farmers
who had no other means of credit
 236 000 000 or about the cost
o f a couple o f battleships The farmers
have already paid back 72 000 -
000 and the 650 000 borrowers have
been kept o ff relief Had they all
gone to town and obtained W P A jobs
the cost would have been six or seven
times the amount o f their loans That
KROZE KOLUM
Time W ill Tell
A ll my life I ve been hearing that 
 Time will tell Always wondered
who would be told and what they d
be told when time got telling Maybe
some o f the following suggestions
will not be so very wide of the mark 
Time will tell the scientist for example 
that truth existed before he
began his investigations Seems likely
there was gravitation before New
ton and his apple seems equally likely
there was electricity before Frank
lin and his kite Every one of the
principles used today was always
available Moral truth is of the same
category Human people in their
hopes and fears their struggles and
aspirations their upreachings and
outgoings are not noticeably different
from the ancients of whom we
have any sort o f adequate record 
A fter all the principles o f life are
comparatively few and not hard to
understand nor difficult to practice 
seems odd we clutter things up so
with inribitions and whatnot and
make life so complex and cumbersome 
Time will tell the mother that her
prayers were not in v a in they did
have an influence I f so many people
can amount to so little seemingly in
spite o f the clinging hope and confidence
and loyalty to mothers how utterly
worthless would a lot more of
us doubtless be i f mothers were not
as they always have been still are 
and for the most part are likely to
continue forever hereafter to be 
Time will tell the teacher Jtpo o ften
discouraged by inadequate equipment
and lack o f appreciation and
underpaid that a good deal o f her
effort was not wasted after all For
there is an immense effort involved
in dealing with the young of the human
family seemingly useless and
unappreciated effort at least part of
the time But when the years have
come and gone and life has unfolded
in somewhat of its fulness many a
teacher has discovered that lorlg-continued
effort is to the fore in the
forceful lives of those who are doing
the things that need doing if things
are to go and to go forward 
Time will tell the politician that
God still lives and is active about the
business o f His world and universe 
in spite o f elections and new deals 
Men may plan and plot and scheme 
for their own ends and purposes We
may have waste of money and crops
and pigs and whatnot but when we
have made our new deals and our
wise-sounding social-plannings with
God left out of the account we are
likely to discover that little overlooked
details like drouths and strikes
and such-like can easily undo our
very smartest human arrangings History
seems to indicate that smart men
can go just about so far and no fa rther 
in arranging things to their own
liking God is apt to take a hand 
about then and it is not always so
pleasant and comfortable for the immediate
bystanders and participants 
Time will tell the employer that
while his plants and machines may be
pretty important and his property interests
pretty valuable that after all 
his men his human concerns and responsibilities 
are much more important 
We learn this particular lesson
with difficulty very slowly but ultimately
it will have to be learned 
if there is to be stability with prosperity
in our world 
Time will tell the preacher that
religion is more than controversy It
is easy to disagree with the politician 
with the statesman with the interpreter
of scripture with the capitalist
and the labor leader or the worker 
with the social engineer with
anybody and everybody even one s
own conscience or intellect or both 
Controversy is easy it fills in the
time and occupies the attention and
all that But just what constructively
or usefully does it accomplish 
When religion is much much more
than that and vitally something quite
different from that a lot of other
things will be well on the way to adjustment
and solution

his trip to the east He and

Massachusetts and about 35 miles
from Boston The storms of last year
felled a lot of timber in that region
and Mr Slauson has a government
contract to cut it The boys had an
interesting trip east one o f the intesting
parts being the fact that they
became separated from Mr Slauson 
who had stopped at Marshfield to get
his family but they were reunited
again They left home on Thursday
and arrived at their destination the

P ER SON AL S
the best way of reducing the relief
appropriations to keep people from
needing relief does not seem to occur
to the economy experts on the congressional
committees 
In the 9th district o f Wisconsin 
where in some counties the Federal
Land Banks have taken over hundreds
o f farms by foreclosure 7 733
farmers have received assistance from
the Farm Security Administration 
Some o f them thus obtained a new
start and even under the adverse
conditions have repaid all their loans
with interest The total loaned was
 1 382 179 of which the farmers
have paid back 401 227 or about 30
per cent and more is being paid back
monthly I t was that kind o f loans
the leaders restricted and declined to
permit to be discussed at any length
on the floor The same leaders helped
to pass a bill for 292 000 000 additional
for the W ar department three
days later It doesn t seem to be how
much appropriations are which bothers
the budget makers as does who
is going to get the money

Sod hump dams and sod flumes
have proved effective in controlling
shallow gullies with small watersheds 
according to V Schroeder engineer
of the Irving CCC camp 
Applicable only in shallow gullies
with small watersheds sod hump
dams are built to restore natural waterways 
the engineer said The dams
are small earth fills covered with blue
grass sod and built across the gully 
When more than one dam is constructed
in the same gully they are
so place dthat the lower dam ponds
water to the foot of the dam above 
Silt carried by run-off water from
fields above is deposited behind each
dam until eventually the gully is filled
and a sodded waterway is established 
The construction o f sod flumes
consists of sloping raw gully heads
and laying strips o f sod over the sloped
part in such a manner that run-off
water can safely flow over the head
of the gully without causing erosion 
The effectiveness o f sod hump dams
and sod flumes in controlling gully
erosion may be seen from the demonstrations
applied on the farms of Harley
Kunes Albert Lubow John Newton 
Rhead brothers J W Horswill 
Earl Horswill Adolph Dragseth W illiam

The fall o f man has made our
hearts like the magnet We refuse
gold and silver and pearls and priceless
jewels and only draw to ourselves
inferior things like steel and
iron By attending God s house you
will acquaint yourself with the things
that God considers valuable and also
have the opportunity to obtain them 
O ur revival meeting is now in its
second week Evangelist Rex Jackson
of Kansas City has been bringing
inspiring messages each night 
You and the family need the benefits
derived from attendance at Church 
Lay aside the things of this life
which are less important than eternal
realities and attend 
The services continue each night at
8 o clock with the exception o f Saturday
night There will be a street
meeting Saturday evening in the business

age would start nothing he says It
would be smothered before Mrs O Leary
had broken the milk stool on
the old bovine His overseas service
has made his marksmanship unerring
but the finding of a wife he says has
him baffled The angle worm he
contends is a natural diet for the
muskie He favors it fo r bait He
says he never knew that to be successfu

has to be put on the hook from the
right end-

GROUNDS FOR F S A LOANS
The willingness o f needy low-income
farm families to plan future operations
carefully and to accept farm
and home management guidance is
the principal basis on which Farm Security
Administration loans are made 
Douglas J Curran local advisor of
Jackson County declared in a recent
announcement on eligibility requirements
of that agency Th#re are 211
rehabilitations borrowers o f the FSA
in this county 
 O ur loans are primarily character
loans made only to those who cannot
obtain credit elsewhere he said
 These loans must have character and
ability behind them in exactly the
same manner as those made in the
past through private lending agen
cies 
Complete rehabilitation of a farm
family after several years of unfavorable
crops and prices may require
from five to ten years of sincere effort
and careful planning the super-

visor pointed out The loan itself is
incident to such planning he said 
 The attitude of the family in its
relations with the FSA is one of the
most important parts of the loans 
the supervisor continued There
must be a sincere desire to cooperate
with the FSA and there must be a determination
on the part of the family
to improve its own condition 
In order to be eligible for a loan
the applicant farm family should (1)
understand what caused its need for
rehabilitation (2 ) realize the necessity
for careful planning of future
operations (3 ) be convinced that
progress can be made by following a
plan and working hard (4 ) keep
farm and home records and realize
that property mortgaged to the FSA
must be accounted for 
The rehabilitation program has
been in operation in Jackson County
for the past four years In that time 
according to Mr Curran there has
been approximately 80 000 00 loaned
to farmers who needed only a little
financial help and guidance to
work their way back to a self-supporting
and independent basis

N EW L IF E IN OLD PASTURES
Seventy-five acres o f worn-out and
overgrazed permanent bluegrass pastures
were given new life this spring
in the Camp Irving demonstrational
area according to J D Jellinger 
local agronomist for the Soil Conservation
Service 
 Because these pastures had thin
sods and were weakened by overgrazing
and low fertility they had lost
much of their effectiveness as a
means of erosion control Also their
productivity has been low Zellinger
says 
The renovation or such pastures
was established by seeding dry-weather
legumes such as alfalfa sweet
clover and red clover in thin bluegrass
sods In place of plowing the
pastures were disked and cultivated to
permit seeding o f legumes without serious
hazards of erosion

ed and Operated by The Great Atlantic Pacific Tea Company
Deficiencies in soil fertility as indicated
by soil tests were remedied
by applying proper amounts of lime
and fertilizer 
To permit the legumes to restore
these areas to good pastures it will be
necessary to exclude grazing in the
summer months the agronomist explained 
Limited grazing is sometimes
permitted in the early fall 
Once established in bluegrass the
legumes repel the egg-laying June
beetle which produces the white grub 
eliminate weeds and furnish nitrogen
to promote grass growth They also 
increase the production of pasture
by supplying growth when the
bluegrass becomes dry and tough
from the summer droughts Zellinger
says 
A R E A L A C C ID E N T
A lawyer died Like many lawyers
he died broke but he left an accident
insurance policy on which his
widow tried to collect 
The insurance company said No 
you cannot collect on this insurance
policy Death is not an accident 
it is a visitation of God 
So the widow went to court and
the judge found in her favor saying 
 Any visitation o f God to a lawyer is
an accident Exchange
