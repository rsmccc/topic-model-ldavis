Something happened in Black River
Falls last Saturday afternoon that
never happened before but possibly
will again In an interesting and fitting
ceremony the corner stpne was
laid in the new postoffice building 
which is rapidly taking on the appearance
of a real postoffice 
It was a cool afternoon but bright 
and hundreds of spectators gathered
to observe the ceremony It started
at 3 p m just after the parade advertising
the Boy Scout fund drive
which took place Monday The band
marched to the end of Main street
and then returned to the postoffice
site where it played a couple of selections 
Attorney E S Jedney was master
of ceremonies and after a brief introductory
speech called upon the
other speakers of the day 
He first called on Sam Warmoltz 
construction engineer for the Treasury
Department who made a few
brief remarks and congratulated the
city on the new building and extended
the wish that the city would grow
to an extent which would make another
larger one necessary in half a
century or so 
Nick Christianson genial superintendent
in charge of the work for J 
S Sweitzer Sons of St Paul who
were awarded the contract was next
called on by Mr Jedney and fulfilled
his promise to make a bow which
was all he did In spite of the fact
that he apparently does not talk Mr 
Christianson has succeeded in making
many friends while engaged on the
job here 
Mayor Anton Hauger was next
called upon and gave a fine talk 
stressing the historical nature of the
occasion In the front ranks of his
interested listeners were two small
lads Peter son of Mr and Mrs Duane
Hoffman and Jimmie son of Mr 
and Mrs James Hancock They are
7 years old Both wore white windbreakers
and the same intent look 
O f the many there they will be among
the few to ever see anothr postoffice
dedicated in the town if any 
Mr Jedney gave a summary of the
history of the postoffice and postmasters
along with other interesting information 
for which he gave credit
to Postmaster Dickey and A P Jones
who had gathered it from many
sources and with on small trouble 
Harold Turner carrier on route 3 
gave a summary of the services rendered
by the post office department
in the city 
Postmaster P W Dickey briefly
described the contents of the small
box which was laid away in the cornerstone
and sealed with a stone to
be opened by another generation The
metal box was carefully sealed In it
were pictures and papers describing
the town of today and its business
and with a summary of the past history 
and a fairly complete history
of the postoffice department Postmaster
Dickey laid the box in the
opening which had been left in the
northeast front corner of the building
and Merlin Collum and Mr Christianson
assisted in fitting and mortering
the stone in place 
The program closed with the band
playing The Star Spangled Banner 
wisely but not too well

The following interesting information
was contained in the talk by Mr 
Jedney 
The first postoffice was established
in this city in 1850 by W W Bennett
in his residence His daughter Mrs 
Jane Bennett Newman now lives in
Flagstaff Arizona and visited here
in 1911 when we had a homecoming
celebration One of the early post
offices was located where Joe Kasik
now has his restaurant Another
building once used is now the property
of the Jackson County Bank and
is used for government offices For a
while after the flood of 1911 while
Martin Lien was a postmaster business
was carried on in the open until
space was arranged for in the Albion
town hall For a number of years
past the J R McDonald building on
First street has been used for a post- i
office and will continue to be used j
until the new one is completed pos- i

The members of the Scout committee

grateful indeed to the members of

fine work Monday in the annual Boy
Scout fund drive 
There were 22 Rotarians and nine
members of the Lions club reporting
at the Eprly Bird breakfast at Lloyd s
cafe Monday morning each of whom
was escorted to the restaurant by a
Boy Scout Plans were made at the
breakfast which was attended by B 
W Ingli scout commissioner from the
Gateway Area La Crosse and seven
or eight names allotted to each member 
They made their collection during
the day and reported in the evening 

With the exception of a few who
have not been able to complete their
canvass it was finished in record
time and with a fine result The committee
is more than appreciative of
the fine spirit shown by the Rotary
and Lion members who made the
drive and for the generosity of the
public Some of the solicitors even
sent cards through the mail thanking
those who donated to them which was
a nice thought

 The town of Cleveland was the
 scene of tragedy yesterday April 18
i that will long be remembered by the
 residents of the town 
[ The charred remains of Claude
 Peterson son of Mr and Mrs Johr
i Peterson of the town of Cleveland
i were identified late in the aftemoor
when it was possible to search througl
i the debris of a fire in the barn or
 the George Ringrose farm in the tow T
1 of Garden Valley The farm was un-
 occupied The barn a large base-
 ment structure containing 25 tons ol
i hay was completely destroyed 
Trouble started in the morning
about 9 o clock when Alby Rosenber
ger substitute mail carrier on the
route out of Alma Center was wounded
by a shot from a 28 gauge shol
i gun carried by Peterson whom he
met on the road and who apparently
 without any provocation shot thri
the windshield at him He was struck
in the shoulder and also cut by flying
glass from the windshield He
 was able to drive to Alma Centei
where he then called the authori-
 ties and reported the shooting He
was cared for by Dr W J Hewson 
Sheriff Waldum and Deputy Bemie
Finch at once went to the vicinity
and started a search for Peterson 
Many joined in the search 
During the morning the fact that
the barn on the Ringrose farm was
burning was observed by Adolph Reineck
and George Fradenburgh and
when the latter arrived there altho
it was enveloped in flames the rafters
were still standing It was probably
between 1 00 and 1 30 p m 
when it was possible to search the embers
and the few charred remains
were found Tracks were found leading
to the barn from the scene of
the shooting 
Sheriff Waldum called District Attorney
Ralph Lund and he and Dr 
Robert Krohn coroner visited the
scene Peterson s watch the metal
part of his purse which was lying
near the body with 11 cents near it 
were identified by John Peterson his
father The gun also was found and
two shells both exploded but whether
the one in the gun had been discharged
or was the result of the heat
it was not possible to determine It
is thought that Peterson probably
shot himself after firing the barn 
but the authorities state that there is
no way of knowing 
Peterson was 26 years of age June
2nd last When 16 years of age he
was convicted and sentenced on two
counts in court here on March 14th
to Green Bay reformatory for assault
with a dangerous weapon Rilla Lowman
and Clarence Swenson were the
victims at that time He was sentenced
to from two to five years 
terms running concurrently He had
been home for some years past 
A rumor to the effect that Riley
Dunn had been missing for a couple
of days caused fear in some in the
community that possibly it was his
body that was found in the barn but
Deputy Bernie Finch had talked with
him a couple of times yesterday so
that rumor was unfounded 
Mr Peterson father of Claude 
stated to the authorities that his son
had said he was going to shoot crows
or rabbits and had left home with his
gun and a few shells after cleaning
the barn He had planned to set out
strawberry plants but it was too wet
that morning Mr Rosenberger said
that he had never had any trouble
with the young man and Mr Peterson
said that his son liked the mail
man 
Peterson leaves his parents and one
sister Elsie Their friends sympathize
deeply with them in their trouble

As announced two weeks ago in
the columns of the Banner-Journal 
an additional allotment of $184 000
has been made by REA to the Jackson
Electric Cooperative for the construction
of rural electric lines in
Jackson County 
These lines will not be built until
such time as positive assurance is given
that a sufficient number of farms
will be wired to make such construction
worth while 
With this thought in mind a demonstration
will be held at the high
school auditorium on Saturday May
6th REA representatives will be on
hand to discuss wiring and the use
of appliances Of special interest to
housewives will be the demonstration
by Miss Harriet Brigham of cooking

mother had asked him to sing for her
and when he did her voice joined in
the song As friends remember her

by the devotion of her family and
friends

In spite of the bad weather of last
Sunday there were many visitors at
 Camp Irving There would have been
I hundreds more had it been a pleasant
i day for many who had planned to
visit the camp were disappointed 
As it was 150 visitors attended the
 birthday open house of the Irving
Civilian Conservation Corps camp and
got acquainted with the soil erosion
I programs which cooperating farmers
are carrying on in the camp s work
area 
The open house an observance of
the sixth anniversary of the establishment
of the Civilian Conservation
Corps was conducted by Gerald E 
Gilbert commanding officer and R 
j E Wolff camp superintendent 
Soil Conservation Service technicij
ans at the camp discussed a model
I farm display to acquaint visitors with
the work being done in Jackson county
to reduce soil and water losses on
i sloping land The display consisted
of a large panel containing a set of
model farms together with photographs
of erosion control work in
Wisconsin and other states The model
farms showed a farm before and
after the inauguration of soil conservation
practices 
While inspecting the exhibit the
visitors learned that since the Irving
camp began functioning erosion control
demonstrations have been established
on 80 farms containing 13077
acres 
CCC enrollees have planted and replanted
437 000 trees on 300 acres
of gullies other eroded land or steep
slopes as a means of permanent erosion
control 
Cooperating farmers are practicing
strip cropping on 2980 acres and contour
farming on 3787 acres 
Mr Wolff pointed out that the program
which each cooperator is carrying
out is a complete program 
worked out by the farmer and Soil
Conservation Service technicians to
put each acre of land to its best use 
 Since erosion cannot be controlled
by any one practice a tailor made
combination of practices is knitted
together for each farm he explained 
Visitors inspected the camp buildings
as part of the open house program 
They were also treated to
doughnuts and coffee

(Galesville Republican)
When an appropriation bill came
up in the house of representatives on
March 25 Congressman Merlin Hull
of the Ninth Wisconsin district made
this plea in introducing an amendment
which would aid dairy farmers 
 I realize that possibly a point of
order will be made on this amendment
but when we stop to consider
the whole situation with reference to
this bill exceeding a billion dollars in
appropriations recognizing the fact
that possibly in its present form it
will vastly expand the expenditures
for agriculture at the same time
something else is happening to dairy
farmers who will receive practically
nothing under this bill They are
having taken away from them funds
which the 74th congress provided in
order to stabilize marketing conditions 
As has been said on the floor 
there is practically nothing in the
bill for the dairymen especially those
o f Wisconsin Minnesota Michigan 
and other states in the Middle West 
The only benefits they will receive
from the bill is a little amount for
soil conservation which will not exceed
an average o f $50 per farm in
my state and other sections in that
country 
 In 1934 congress passed an act
setting aside for the purpose of assisting
agricultural-marketing conditions 
30 per cent o f the customs receipts 
Under that law practically all
o f the expenditures have been made
fo r the purchase o f dairy products 
fruits vegetables and other products
for distribution under relief The
amount which the dairymen have received
under this law and under this
attempt o f the department to stabilize
market prices has been relatively
small 
 Last year the receipts under that
30 percent provision amounted to approximately
$150 000 000 and of
that amount about $33 000 000 was
expended to stabilize the price of
dairy products In the past six years
the total amounts of such aids to
dairymen through this and other provisions 
have amounted to approximately
$67 000 000 That is about
$1 600 000 less than the adjustment
funds which have been granted to
the cotton crop alone last year Comparatively 
the figures indicate how
little dairying has received in the
past and what a small portion o f agricultural-
aid funds has been received
by the dairy farmer The Government
now holds 11 000 000 bales
o f cotton upon which it has loaned
in excess of $500 000 000 I t now
has $70 000 000 loaned on com and
$48 000 000 on wheat in this year s
operations 
 In the past six years the purchases
of surplus dairy products by the Surplus
Commodities Corporation have
been as follows 1934 $10 958 000 
1935 $9 718 000 1936 $4 001 134 
1937 $4 009 004 1938 $5 876 592 
1939 $33 080 000 or a total of
$67 642 730 
 The customs receipts which were
in excess o f $400 000 000 in 1937 
will approximate $307 000 000 for
1938 Consequently the funds available
for marketing purposes will be
about $92 100 000 Under the law 
only 25 per cent o f such receipts can
be used fo r dairy purchases Instead
o f $33 000 000 for stabilizing dairy
prices there will be about $22 000 -
000 available which amount will be
further reduced by the holdover of
the Dairy Marketing Corporation 
 In the last few weeks the department
has stopped going into the mar-

ket to make purchases to stabilize
dairy prices The consequence is the
price of butter cheese and whole milk
all dairy products ha3 been rapidly
going down Milk is down to as low
as 1 cents per quart in Wisconsin 
or about 85 cents per 100 pounds 
That decline will continue if the government
stays out of the market for
lack of funds 
 A t present the Dairy Marketing
Corporation is holding approximately
70 000 000 pounds o f butter obtained
on a loan out o f this $33 000 000 
That 70 000 000 pounds is going to
be gradually decreased by the distribution
of some of the product to relief
agencies but by the first o f Ju ly
there will still be 5 000 000 pounds of
butter in the storage houses under
the Dairy Marketing Corporation 
F ifty million pounds of butter and
the Commodity Credit Corporation
will probably undoubtedly ask for the
payment o f the loan Unless we can
obtain additional funds that entire
50 000 000 pounds o f butter will be
forced on to the market or else distributed
for relief to be paid for
from the $22 500 000 available from
customs receipts 
 The enormity o f the loss of the
dairy farmers which has occurred already 
since the government pulled
out o f the principal markets and
turned to the Dairy Products Corporation
for relief purposes has been
approximately 20 percent on our
prices An expert in the Department
of Agriculture this morning advised
me that undoubtedly unless the market
is further supported butterfat
will go down to 15 or 16 or 17 cents
a pound 
 In brief what does this mean to
the dairy farmers of the principal
butter and cheese-producing states
I f butterfat should go down to even
18 cents a pound you will have a 33
percent reduction in the income of
about 450 000 or 500 000 farmers
out there in a few states or the northwest 
That will result in the loss of
not $50 000 000 but from 100 to 125
million dollars in the price the farm ers
will receive for their cream in
that section of the country That
decline in farm purchasing power will
not only be devastating to the dairy
districts but the effect will be felt
nationally as well as locally 
 Unless this amendment is adopted
and at least 60 per cent o f the customs
receipts shall be made available
for purchases o f dairy products or
some other plan is adopted o f deriving
a large amount of these customs 
receipts which will amount to only
$307 000 000 total this year then all
that the Department o f Agriculture
can do is to take over the butter already
in the hands o f the Dairy Marketing
Corporation and turn it over
to the relief forces and let the market
take the natural course I t will
have less than $ 10 000 000 with
which to assist in maintaining even
relatively low prices on a product
valued at one and one-half billions of
dollars 
 I realize that possibly a point of
order may be made upon this legislation
upon an appropriation bill but
it does seem to me that the importance
of this matter to 2 000 000 dairy
farmers should be sufficient to prompt
those who may desire to make the
point o f order to withhold their objection
and permit the dairy farmers 
poultry raisers fruit and vegetable
growers to have this additional portion
of the customs duties devoted to
saving their markets to some degree 
Otherwise while more than a billion
dollars will go to those who grow cotton 
com wheat tobacco and rice 
the funds for dairvmen and other
farmers will be reduced to 40 per
cent or more Unless a point o f order
is made I am confident the
house will adopt this amendment

The state tournaments have been

is classified as the state Because
o f this change classification
will be given at the District the same
as if it were the state The reason
fo r this regionalization o f the state
contest was to cut expenses Thus
making it possible for more bands to
attend a state contest and receive
state ratings The same regionalization
has been made in the National
contest 
State medals will be given to solos

Clouds
By Kenneth Kolbrak
Clouds come and go 
Some carry rain others snow 
Some are black some are grey 
They come by night they come by
day 
The clouds 
Clouds come and go 
Some are swift others slow 
Some seem to stand in a certain
space 
Others go at a terrific pace 
The clouds 
Clouds come and go 
Some seem to shrink others grow 
They float through the air with the
greatest o f ease 
They ride on the smallest summer
breeze 
The clouds 
Clouds come and go 
Where they go I do not know 
They go gliding off into space 
While others come and fill their place 
The clouds 
W h e n I W as Ten and Five
Martha Pasek
When I was ten and five 
I used to go to school
I used to trick the teachers 
B ut I really was a fool 
Those school days
Were joy 
 Now do your lesson tomorrow 
The teacher said so clear 
But the next day when I got to class
I said I didn t hear 
Those school days
Oh boy 
The happiest days of my life
Were when I would skip school 
Then in the office I would go 
But I never obeyed the rule 
Those schools days
vNo more 
But I neednt think of them any
more 
For they ne er shall come again 
Tho the memory o f them shall forever
W ithin my heart remain 
Those school days
Before 
So when I think o f school 
I t s only a dream o f youth
That s gone from life forever 
And caused me to tell the truth 
Those school days
Are gone

Landscape Short Course
The Department of Horticulture of
the University announces a two-day
landscape demonstrational and lecture
program to be held Friday and Saturday 
June 2 and 3 at the University 
There will be an enrollment fee of
$ 1 00 payable at the time of registration 
Program starts at 9 00 a 
m June 2 and closes at 4 00 p m 
June 3rd 
A similar two-day program was
held last year and is being repeated
this year by request 
Pastures
 Farmers who give careful attention
to a well planned pasture program
find it to be a good investr
ment 
Pasture which the cows harvest
themselves costs only about half as
much as hay or silage or barn feed
in general finds Gus Bohstedt animal
feeding authority at the Wisconsin
College of Agriculture He
recommends that milking cows should
receive two-thirds or more of their
entire feed intake from pasture at
all times during the growing season 
a management plan which presupposes
good pasture even during midsummer 
To provide pasture throughout the 
growing season means a program of
both permanent and supplementary
pasture products This may require
a fertilizer treatment and possibly
reseeding or renovating some of the
permanent pastures that have become
unproductive It would also mean
the use of supplementary pastures
during midsummer when bluegrass
pastures are dry Pasture crops
which Bohstedt finds excellent for
midsummer grazing are a lfalfa or
other dry weather legumes such as
sudan grass or brom gramm Sudan
grass however may need to be pastured
with certain precautions 
Bohstedt finds that pasture is the
one most nearly complete feed which
cows receive during the entire year 
In the winter time however hay and
silage especially the grass or legume
silage come nearest equalling pasture
in nutritive value He states that as
compared with grain good roughage 
whether pasture hay or grass and legume
silage supplies cheap protein 
high quality of protein as well as
lime iodine iron and other valuable
minerals Besides this it supplies carotene
or vitamin A and vitamin D
(in sun-cured hay) vitamin C the
grass juice factor and a number of
other vitamins The excellent feed
values or grasses and roughages Bohstedt
says explains why herbivorous
animals have been able to continue
for thousands o f generations 
1939 Soil Program
The Agricultural Adjustment Administration
recently announced that
May 1st will be the final date for
 farmers to complete and sign farm
plans for participation in the 1939
 agricultural conservation program 
Farmers who have not completed
these forms should either pet in with
their township committeeman or call
 at the county agent s office before
May 1st Either the completion o f
a farm plan or a letter from a landlord
indicating his intention to participate
in the 1939 program will assure
inspection of a farm for the
purpose of determining payments It
will be impossible to obtain payments
on farms for which no performance
inspection is so requested by May 1st

Henry Collum who bought the former
E id building from Oscar Skaar
some time ago and since then has
been tearing part of it down and gettin
g the rest o f it raised up and ready
fo r moving 
Mr Knutson o f Blair the mover fot his moving trucks under the builing
last Friday and with the aid of
a small truck moved it out into Main
street I t was then discovered that
the truck did not have power enough
to move it so one o f the county
trucks was called into service and it
took them about 15 minutes to get
the building in its new location 
Bernard Finch Jackson county police
patrol supervised the traffic on
No 95 and No 12 and the traffic
was delayed only a short time and
then this was mostly when the truck
hit the soft shouldfer just off 12 going
into the location 
A large crowd o f folks assembled
to watch the proceedings and followed
the movers right up to the end 
Trailing along behind was Mr Eid 
who has conducted a store in the
building for over 35 years No doubt
he had a heart throb as the building
was being moved 
The building was set back from the
highway about 30 feet and Mr Collum
will use it for a store house and
a garage He will fix it up in good
shape with a cement floor and make
it into a first class building

The reciprocal trade treaty policy 
to which Secretary o f State Cordell
H ull is so strongly committed is having
its difficulties from within administration
circles as well as from
changing conditions abroad The new
troubles come mainly because the
European barter system is interfering
with our foreign trade with the
countries which Secretary H ull had
been very partial in his trade policies 
When Germany took over Czecho-Slovakia
the very favorable treaty with
the latter country was abrogated In
a day our trade practically ceased 
and importation of shoes and other
commodities which had worried some
lines o f industry on this side o f the
ocean came to an end A t the same
time Germany s barter policy ran
head-on against our reciprocal trade
with some South American countries 
Now Germany is bartering with Mexico
for oil and minerals with Brazil
for cotton and Argentine for meats 
The race for trade is in the beginning
and unless war comes suddenly it
may be long and swift 
When Secretary Wallace proposed
his export plan for wheat proposing
to sell fifteen or twenty millions of
bushels to Brazil at a loss o f 15 or
20 cents per bushel Argentine objected
to the State department and
that department let out a roar of
objection which stopped the deal The
Department insists that any such
dumping policy for wheat or cotton
will ruin the trade treaty program 
The administration is committed to
the program and the Department of
Agriculture has had to back-track
upon its proposals to find a market
abroad for farm surpluses through
subsidies from the federal treasury 
Suddenly the president launches a
barter program of his own o f greater
scope than any subsidy plan offered
by Secretary Wallace and along
exactly the same line as the barter
policy of Germany He proposes to
barter $350 000 000 worth of wheat
and cotton for rubber tin and other
such products which are not produced
in this country Instead o f subjecting
our farmers to added competition
by importing more agricultural
commodities in order to broaden the
markets in other countries for automobiles 
farm and industrial machinery 
etc the president would trade
cotton and wheat for raw materials
needed by our own industries and
possibly fo r our war preparations It
will not involve the payment o f subsidies 
unless the foreign countries
are permitted to fix prices upon all
the commodities exchanged 
Great Britain and Holland both
have rubber and tin to barter for cotton
and wheat Our government
owns or has loans on $700 000 000
worth o f cotton and can easily obtain
the wheat Brazil has manganese 
of which our country produces
little Some other countries have
other raw materials which we have
not I f the president succeeds in
overcoming the opposition of the Department
of State he may develop a
rather extensive barter trade But
in doing so he may damage the reciprocal
trade program with several of
the seventeen countries with which
treaties are now in force 
The Department of State is not
without strong backing in its opposition
to bartering or swapping Certain
lines o f industry have benefitted
more particularly from the reciprocal
trade treaties while farmers in general
have not been so favored Motor
vehicle and machinery industries
and the manufacturers of farm tractors
and other farm machinery have
had broad influence in the fram ing of
trade treaties Other industries which
have a lower selling price for their
products abroad than are charged our
own people and so dispose o f their
wares likewise reap advantages
which may be interfered with in a
general swapping program But the
president now seems more worried
about farm surpluses here than he
is about the policies which the Department
of State seems to regard
as sacred There is likely to be fireworks
in plenty i f he carries out his
proposals 
Talk of an early adjournment of
congress which was strong during the
first two months o f the session is
subsiding as weeks drag along into
months with many o f the more important
problems scarcely taken up 
I t is said that the president has been
inquiring o f his congressional leaders
why more rapid progress is not
being made The House is farther
ahead with its business than is the
Senate and has made unusual progress
upon the regular appropriation
bills but there are big questions
ahead and even the leaders do not intimate
that any definite plan is proposed
as to some of them The questions
of W P A and PW A fo r the next
fiscal year will loom large in May
and June The new committee appointed
to investigate the entire subject
of relief has not settled down to
business as yet It may require
weeks I f there is to be tax legislation 
nobody knows what will be proposed 
The big Naval appropriation
bill still is in the making and how
big it will be and for how much may
depend upon what happens in Europe
in the next few weeks 
Then farm legislation is also looming
larger daily The Senate has the
Agricultural appropriation bill before
it with amendments pending to put
a floor under prices of dairy products
in particular The demand of western
dairymen to have dairy products
included with cotton corn wheat 
rice and tobacco as basic and to share
in parity payments is growing stronger
as the dairy markets continue to
weaken The farmers cost of production 
measure has been reported
to the Senate with a fa ir chance of
passing that body notwithstanding
administration opposition A petition
to force action in the House is being
well signed It seems incredible
that congress should adjourn without
some action to stop or at least suspend
farm foreclosure actions which
are in greater number and volume
now than in the dark days o f 1932
and 1933 Looking over what congress
has to do and properly should
do predictions as to early adjournment
seem fa r fetched 
The war situation in Europe also
may bring new problems The Secretary
of State says that that omin-

The business woman s department
met last Friday evening at the home
o f Miss Alice Rush who was assisted
as hostess by Miss Ruth Ann Bailey
and Miss Emma Neildorf Mrs Mary
Bloom was in charge o f the topic 
Birds and talked on migration of
birds Miss Blanche Duxbury talked
on Wisconsin Birds and Mrs Jennie
White gave an interesting talk on
birds that are becoming extinct and
translated from the French a story
on the stork I t was a particularly
interesting meeting 
Mr and Mrs Herman J Gebhardt
arrived home last week from Miami 
Florida where they had spent the
time since just after the first o f the
year They left home New Year s
day and took it slowly as they were
driving a new car They spent the
first night on their trip south at La
Grange Illinois and the next was just
outside of Columbus Ohio where
they remained for a week with Mrs 
Gebhardt s sister Mrs Albert Been 
They were there for the inauguration 
which was a big affair They drove
on through Kentucky and Tennessee
and stopped to look over the Norris
Dam They were high in their praise
of the roads through the state of
Georgia It was January 13th and
a Friday when they entered Florida 
but the day and the date had nothing
to do with them the next two and a
h alf months which they found delightful 
They engaged an apartment
in Miami and had a delightful time
sightseeing enjoying the sunshine and
bathing which they made a daily
practice at either Miami or Tahaiti
beach Mr and Mrs Gebhardt agree
that they think Miami Beach the most
beautiful city they have seen although
some o f the other cities have periods
during the year when they equal if
not surpass it They closed the windows
at their apartment only one day
during their stay They enjoyed a
seaplane trip to Havana with Mr and
Mrs Andrew Bissig o f Wisconsin
Rapids also cranberry people but
who spend the winters in Chicago and
also own a home in Miami Their trip
to Havana was a conducted tour and
they enjoyed every moment o f it and
were much interested in the Working
Men s Club which has 40 000 members
and offers unusual advantages 
The Miami Rotarians offered the visitors
entertainment on numerous occasions 
and all in all they had just
a fine interesting winter They were
amazed at the way Miami is growing 
An interesting thing about it was the
fact that practically all the homes
have all the hot water they want from
the sun s rays water flowing through
copper coils covered with glass in a
box on the roof which heats the
water as hot as anyone could want it 
On their way home they saw Dr Rollin
Thompson at Orlando and found
him well Mr Gebhardt has been in
every state in the Union except
Maine and never loses his interest in
the new places He and Mrs Gebhardt
thoroughly enjoy their winter
trips and return home ready to attend
to the duties o f their cranberry
farm and plan a trip for the next
year

By L H Kingston
A ll our northern counties are recognizing
that the most valuable of
all their remaining natural resources
are their lakes and streams Their
forests are gone and it will be at least
thirty years before they can begin
to harvest another crop o f timber 
These counties have no mineral deposits
and the land is so rough or
poor in agricultural quality that it
cannot compete these days with better
land already under the plow 
So the great vacation industry that
has grown around the waters o f
northern Wisconsin seems to be the
one great hope which the people of
that region may have for the future
and it must be recognized that the
best way to assure economic security
fo r the north country is to do all we
can to promote the tourist industry 
There is very much o f this promoting
that can be done 
Consider fishing for an instance 
Fishing for game fih is without a
doubt one o f the foremost attractions
fo r vacationists so it is apparent
that good fishing should be maintained
at all costs But is good fishing
being maintained True the conservation
department planted a billion
fish last year but does that mean we
are bound to have good fishing No 
the problem is not as simple as that 
Trout fishing is an important phase
o f angling in Wisconsin We have
thousands o f miles of trout streams
but I know personally that they are
all operating at a very low efficiency 
They are producing but a very
small percentage o f the trout they
could produce 
Prejudice or public opinion has set
up a custom that will allow only one
specie of trout to be planted in each
stream We find one stream being
stocked with rainbow trout exclusively 
in another nothing but brook trout
are planted while brown trout are
looked upon with considerable disfavor
and are placed only in such waters
as have proved unsuitable for
either o f the others As a result long
stretches o f water in all our streams
are fishless because they are not suitable
for the single specie being planted 
Rainbow trout prefer rapids and
they refuse to live in slow water unless
they have no other choice brook
trout always desert larger streams in
search of colder water as soon as hot
weather comes so mile after mile of
snow water in our streams are fishless
most o f the summer Brown
trout should be planted to fill in these
gaps and make the streams 100 
fishable 
Another thing brook trout generally
feed in the morning rainbows in
the afternoon or early evening 
browns about dusk so i f your
stream contains all three kinds of
trout you have an all day stream 
Each o f the three have different habits 
they select different lurking
places they strike different flies and
they put up a different fight A variety
o f all three provides a most
zestful kind o f trout fishing 
The old idea that browns kill out
the other species is I believe unfounded 
TTiey often survive the
others true but that is because they
are harder to catch Why worry
about this though for now days
about the only fish we catch are the
fish we plant Any specie may be
kept in proper balance by careful
stocking 
Better trout fishing is but one detail
in the improvement o f fishing in
general which in turn is but a phase
o f the great problem of economic
security in the northern Wisconsin
Progress in solving this problem will
come only as we are able to work
out those details In this one fact
that applies to trout fishing applies to
them all any program set up must
be based or scientific research and
study o f facts not on public sentiment
and prejudice

The glad days o f Spring are soon
ahead 
To fields the toiling sweating farmer
goes 
Who gives us this day our daily bread
From earthly things he plants and
grows 
W ith God s good will down in his
heart
He bravely starts his toiling day 
This unsung hero does his part 
To stronger mold our U S A 
We hear o f heroes of the skies 
Brave fliers who fly their way 
But just as brave a courage lies
In farm ers hearts who plow the clay 
His grit equals the sailors or marines
Who sail the old ocean s deep 
As he fills the soil with his machines
So that God s grain our souls will
keep 
Who dares say he isn t our hero
Cheer him on his heart is grand 
Thru the heat o f summer or zero
He s truly the Hero o f our Land

The controversial budget bill has
recently been reported for passage by
the Joint Committee on Finance The
original recommendations o f Governor
Heil have been increased by $1 -
726 000 00 and now represents the
sum of $68 783 000 00 However this
amount does not include any money
for relief for the coming biennium 
I t is generally conceded that there
must be added to the budget for relief
at least $4 000 000 00 attempts
will also be made in both houses of
the Legislature to restore certain appropriations
for educational purposes
to their original figures It is therefore 
quite evident that whan the budget
is finally agreed upon it will exceed
the 1937-1939 budget by sev-

eral million dollars It is not an easy
task to decrease state expenditures 
Last week the Assembly so riddled
the code bills with amendments that
the bills were considered worthless 
and no final action was taken It is
v fry probable that ino code bill will be
passed which will affect towns cities
and villages with a population o f less
than 5 000 and that if a code bill is
passed it will deal only with large
population-centers 
The proposed increase in old-age
pensions are being held pending final
action on the budget b ill in all probability 
there will be little or no increases
granted Likewise the many
promises for automobile license fee
reduction will not pass 
The bill relating to the outright repeal
o f the Teachers Tenure Law is
still in doubt as the Assembly by a
vote of 47 to 45 tabled the measure 
It is certain that another attempt will
be made to take the bill up again and
to pass it The other Tenure Bill 
which applies only to one-room
schools has passed the Assembly and
was messaged to the Senate 
The Trading Stamp Bill which
passed the Senate some time ago was
engrossed by the Assembly by a vote
of 50 to 44 it will come up for final
passage this week
