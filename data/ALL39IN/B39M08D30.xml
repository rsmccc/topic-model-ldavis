    attended the organization from the start Merlin Hull spoke briefly upon the
    mail service fo r small towns and rural communities and com pared the econom
    ies in that service with the m ore elaborate expenditures o f other branches

    year is expended practically all o f which is paid fo r through postal
    receipts J F Nicholson who has been the postoffice inspector o f this

    to im prove the service and at the same time econom ize on expenditures R M
    M atteson was on the program fo r a talk on the shortcomings he had observed
    in our local mail service He mentioned a few cases in which he thought that
    the service might be made a bit more accom m odating to some o f our people
    such as putting up an additional mail box here and there but in the main his
    criticism s were an expression o f approval o f the excellent mail service
    which is afforded by our postal officials employees and carriers T hereafter

    agricultural instructor who came here the first o f July from Baldwin is
    contributing the fo llowing interesting explanation o f the vocational
    agriculture course which will be well worth reading It will afford a better
    understanding o f what the course hopes to accomplish Follow ing is his
    contribution No doubt most o f you have heard o f the introduction o f the
    course o f vocational agriculture to the local high school program Courses o
    f vocational agriculture such as the one we will have here have been in
    rural high schools o f the state o f W isconsin in the neighborhood o f 20
    years The num ber o f departments has grown during this time until today
    there are 183 in the state with an enrollment o f 8954 boys most o f which
    are from the farm As the name implies these departments are fo r the purpose
    o f giving farm boys the modern version o f the vocation o f farming The
    courses o f vocational agriculture as taught in our local high schools are
    split into fo u r years The first year deals entirely with our soil
    fertilizers crops and management in general o f the crops and soil The
    second year is devoted to a complete study o f farm animals breeding
    practices feeding and general management o f livestock The work o f the
    juniors after this year will be devoted to the mechanics o f a farm such as
    engine repair soldering forge work glazing farm m achinery repair and farm w
    oodwork The fourth year deals with farm management and marketing farm
    products Aside from the regular class work at school we hope these boys from
    the farm will carry on practices on the home farm which will prove to him
    self the value o f practices which are not always carried out as they might
    be to make fo r more efficient farming One example o f what might be done by
    many o f our farm boys is the testing o f the home herd o f cows to get a
    definite record o f the amount o f butterfat each cow is producing in the
    herd Provisions have been made at school where this w ork might be done with
    little or no cost just a little extra work one day each month by the
    individual boy At the present time 3500 agricultural boys in the state are
    testing their home herds with a total o f 30 000 cows A very m odem
    up-to-date department with new m odem equipment has been provided in the
    Junior High school where the agricultural classes will be held W e hope to
    encourage all farm boys who are in school or who plan to attend high school
    this fall for the first time to give some consideration to this course I f
    there are any questions which you would like to discuss I would be glad to
    see you at the high school any time As a personal word to this announcement
    I hope to be o f service to you boys and parents in the rural areas and to
    local business men who are also cooperating with us in this work Miss
    Melvina Halverson who is a teacher in the Indian Agency in Yerrington Nevada
    where she has been in the governm ent em ploy during the past year has spent
    her vacation at the home o f her parents Mr and Mrs Carl M Halverson o f

    attending summer school at Eau Claire and received her degree She left
    Monday to return to Nevada and was accom panied by her sister Miss Dorothy

    sister will take a business course in Reno during the winter and her brother
    will attend high school at Yerrington They will undoubtedly have a
    delightful year am ong the new surroundings Miss Halverson states that Miss

    home All who have visited the Olson home will appreciate his description and
    all who know Charley Ristow will be interested in what Mr Gipple has to say
    about him W h o W o u ld n t Be the Icem an (B y B A G ) Mr and Mrs Bert A
    Gipple Mr and Mrs Arthur B Lyon and son along with Mr and Mrs S G Langston
    and Mr and Mrs Clarence Felder and daughter o f La Crosse drove to Black
    River Falls last Sunday and passed the afternoon at the home o f Mr and Mrs
    Clarence Olson On their w ay they picked up Mrs Lizzie Patterson at North
    Bend Arriving at the Falls they stopped at the home o f Mr and Mrs C S
    Ristow who joined them fo r the day at the Olson home Messrs Ristow Langston
    and Gipple and Mrs Patterson were all once residents o f the North Bend
    community as was Mrs Felder daughter o f the Langstons so this was a sort o
    f Bender reunion Also Mrs Lyon Mrs Felder and Mrs Olson were schoolmates at
    the La Crosse State Teachers College Another reunion Mrs Ristow before her
    marriage was Miss Lila McDonald daughter o f Mr and Mrs J H McDonald W hen
    she was a young girl her parents operated the old North Bend hotel later
    moving to a farm near the Ristow farm in Mill Creek So she was another North
    Bender in the group The Clarence Olsons are son-in-law and daughter o f Mr
    and Mrs Ristow And what a home they have! You have heard o f show places W
    ell this wasnt built fo r one Mr and Mrs Olson have an eye fo r the
    beautiful and w hile visitors may admire the place the Olsons en joy it
    every day the year round No you guessed wrong These two are not o f the idle
    rich no matter the place suggests it That is it much resembles the pictures
    o f summer homes in the east or o f movieland celebrities in H ollywood The
    Olsons are not that sort Mr Olson is the Falls iceman He is up with the dawn
    through the open season and is a fairly busy man through the winter months F
    or more than 20 years Mrs Olson has taught History in Black River Falls High
    school which suggests that the board o f education believes she is about the
    best in the land or they would have let her out long ago This Olson place
    which were it possible would do to pick up and set down in H ollyw ood or
    any place is in the wilds although not more than five minutes drive from the
    heart o f the city W hen you turn off a street and start down a trail lined
    by the upshoot o f a cut-over tim ber tract it doesnt seem that you are g
    oing anywhere Then without warning you com e upon Fairyland in the
    wilderness There it is a large house o f pleasing design surrounded by beds
    o f beautiful flow ers a variety o f native trees great rocks and all
    looking down upon Black river which winds its way 50 feet below As fo r the
    grounds the natural lay has been preserved as much as possible and here and
    there cozy nooks have been contrived O f particular interest is a large rock
    garden and pool and form ing the background are great black rocks placed
    there by some upheaval probably millions o f years ago The sides and walls o
    f the pool are native rock A bout all there was to do to have a w ater
    supply was to pipe from a spring near by But you must enter the home to
    appreciate this haven W ide glassedin porches surround it These are nicely
    appointed In fact everything is artistic That holds fo r grounds and the
    home There is nothing gaudy nothing orn ate everywhere good taste abounds
    The arrangement o f the rooms shows careful planning The great living-room
    is particularly appealing The stone o f the fireplace is o f unusual form
    ation and was dug on the grounds It is a room that gives you a desire to
    move right in and stay The home is m odem to the last word but first com e
    com fort and convenience in the planning W ell baskets w ere unpacked and a
    cafeteria dinner served on the porch then much reminiscing until the table
    was cleared and a stroll about the grounds It was a delightful day with the
    Olsons C harley a R eal F arm er Everybody in Jackson county knows Charley
    Ristow His name and acquaintance has carried much farther than that among
    agriculturists A fter leaving North Bend he moved up to Black River Falls
    and bought a farm at the outskirts o f the city Everybody knows that farm
    lands close up to the Falls are not the best in the world Charleys old
    friends at the Bend laughed at him fo r leaving that fertile section and
    settling on a light-soil farm And the place he bought wasnt much to look at
    Pretty much the same as the old Stearns farm here when W alter Y oung took
    it over Charleys father old A ugust Ristow was a good farm er before him but
    Charley went to Madison and took the short course and other courses and he
    learned much about soils In time he brought that farm up high in production
    and one o f his hobbies was c o m It wasnt long before Ristow c o m began to
    take premiums at the Jackson County Fair and then at other fairs and corn
    grow ers ju st couldnt see how he did it on a farm right next to Black River
    Falls Then came a day when the Ristow co m won a w orlds championship out at
    the San Francisco exposition o f some years back and then again led in a
    show arranged fo r the 14 best c o m states And along with his c o m growing
    Charley was recognized as a dairy cattle man and he was called upon to join
    the Farmers Institute forces and also in demand fo r judging at fairs The
    Ristow farm still going strong is operated by a son Clifford It is a dairy
    farm with a milk route that did a business o f 10 000 last year Charley
    lives in town but goes out and snoops around daily He admits however that
    son is just as good a farm er as he ever was W hen you go to Black River
    Falls and have a bit o f time drive to the Ristow farm and inspect the bam
    It is up-to-the-minute in equipment even to fans and an electric flykiller
    But what w ill strike you first are those white concrete floors No old m
    aids kitchen was ever cleaner Y ou M A N Y L O C A L T E A C H E R S B E G

    deal was recently made whereby the Rust Cotton Picker will be manufactured
    at the Coop tractor plant at Arthurdale W V Present plans said John Rust one
    o f the ingeneous brothers who invented the picker are fo r the production o
    f 50 to 100 machines during the com ing winter after which it is hoped
    production will be stepped up to take care o f the demand It will take a
    production schedule o f about 10 000 machines a year to saturate the
    potential market It is said that the Rust Bros have refused fabulous sums
    from implement companies fo r the patent rights but the brothers were not so
    minded and they chose the Arthurdale plant partly because it is a
    cooperative organization doing its part toward solving present-day farm
    problem s The Arthurdale plant will m anufacture the special tractor fo r
    hauling the picking machine as well as the picking units which can be
    removed from the tractor to make way fo r other farm machines The Rust
    machine consists primarily o f an endless belt carrying several hundred
    smooth wire spindles As it passes over the row o f cotton the rotating
    spindles enter the plants The speed o f the spindle carrier and the
    consequent movement o f the spindles in the backward direction during
    contact with the plants is approximately equal to the forw ard travel o f
    the machine The spindles therefore while in the plant rotate in a position
    approxim ately stationary with relation to the stalks This avoids damaging
    the plants Prior to their entrance into the plants the spindles are autom

    such practices as contour strip cropping terracing gully con trol through

    purposes S oil-saving T hem e Theme o f the entire conservation program is
    wise land use fo r every acre assign each acre to its proper task the
    superintendent said Farmers are protecting weak acres with trees and grass
    while letting strong acres bear the burden o f intensive crop production
    aided by w hatever soil-building and soil-saving practices are necessary he
    explained W o lff cited the resolution passed by the W isconsin Legislature
    asking the G overnor to proclaim Soil Erosion W eek which urged W isconsin
    people to dedicate September 3 to 9 to a consideration o f the im portance o
    f conserving the states rich soil resources The superintendent urges local

    cups brow n sugar 2 cups vinegar 1 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp ginger 1 tsp allspice

    and one tablespoon flou r mixed together Slice a lemon over this discarding
    all seeds A dd bits o f butter then pour 1 cup boiling water over all and
    cover with a crust Bake in a hot oven until crust is nicely brow ned I found
    two handy hints recently that are extra good and if you ll try them I m sure
    you ll agree When cutting cinnam on rolls take a piece o f heavy thread or a
    small string Slip under the edge o f the roll until your slice is the right
    width Then bring the ends o f thread up over the top cross them and give a
    quick jerk No sticky fingers or spilled sugar if you do it this way
    especially if you have sweetened applesauce spread thin and rolled up along
    with the brow n sugar cinnamon and butter The other handy hint concerns
    labeling your jars o f jams jellies etc W hen the freshly filled and sealed
    jars have cooled slightly take an ordinary w ax crayon and write on them
    This label w ont rub off after the jars are cold yet w ill readily wash off

    W ashington is much more concerned with the European situation than with
    what is happening in amd to our own country just at present It is no
    different than the rest o f the country however as our millions gather about
    the radios day aind night to get the very latest news bulletins from across
    the waters W ith the experience o f the W orld war which plunged the two
    billions people o f the w orld into the misery o f what seems to be an
    endless depression it hasnt seemed ju st possible to most sensible folks
    that the greedy and war-mad statesmen could dare to bring on another crisis
    which even threatens war Apparently we have not yet com e to a very full
    realization o f the meaning o f pow er politics the systems under which the
    few grow pow erful at the expense o f the many W e have some conception o f
    the predatory practices o f big city gangs in our own country but it does
    not seem possible that similar gangs can dominate nations and continents
    abroad The president has been kept in touch with foreign politics and the
    movements o f political leaders abroad by the State department Upon the
    adjournment o f congress he embarked upon a governm ent w ar vessel fo r an
    extended cruise and fishing trip to the coast o f New Foundland and
    thereabouts He was on his return trip when the Dantzig situation became
    acute He hurried back to the W hite House to counsel with his cabinet He had
    made previous attempts to prolong peace and bring the European countries to
    a sense o f conciliation without success This time he addressed his appeal
    to the King o f Italy in the name o f Christianity asking the intercession o
    f that country toward peace He and his councillors have been hopefully
    awaiting the e ffe ct o f his appeal The new treaty between Germamy and
    Russia was considered a sound reason fo r this approach to the Italian
    governm ent as Italy and its political philosophy has been in opposition to
    the communistic Russia Italy poured its troops and materials into Spain to
    prevent Russian influence becom ing dominant there Russia backed the fight
    against the Framco rebellion and at times it seemed as though Russia and
    Italy might becom e more directly involved in a conflict The new alignment o
    f Germany and Russia may have been unexpected by Mussolini the dictator o f
    Italy the man who tells the Italian King how much sn u ff he may use and
    when he may sneeze There must have been considerable work dome by the
    officia l wise-guys o f the State department in the preparation o f the
    docum ent to the Italian King more especially as to how the message should
    be addressed The King has no power and not much influence in the affairs o f
    his country or those o f Europe He can merely sign on the dotted line when
    Mussolini tells him to But a couple o f years ago after the dictator had
    conquered the almost defenseless Abyssinia he made a grand-stand play by
    giving the K ing the new title o f Em peror o f Ethiopia It was a little
    by-play fo r the Italian people to emphasize his own aggrandizement by
    taking on another title to the dozen or more the King had had since he was
    christened as a baby crownprince But our own State department has never
    officially recognized the new title In fact but fo r the damage feared to
    our foreign trade our governm ent might have made a lot o f trouble fo r
    Mussolini in his A frican campaign It threatened to prevent Italy from
    purchasing coal oil and other war materials from our foreign traders and had
    the neutrality law been fully observed it would have done so It did not
    however and the K ing is still just a king and not an em peror on our o
    fficial records Consequently some little skill must have been required in
    addressing the K ing so as not to offen d him or his imperial boss It would
    seem o f little moment but titles are sacred things in some countries abroad
    Regardless o f all else it is to be hoped that the appeal to the K ing or em
    peror (o r K ing and em peror) may have been productive o f the desired
    result The State department is not on a 40-hour week as the crisis continues
    It is in receipt o f constant com munications from its ambassadors abroad
    which keep it inform ed o f what other governm ents are doing It has been
    remarkably successful in keeping posted on the w ar situation ever since it
    becam e acute previous to the Munich conference o f last year Apparently it
    has known more about what has been transpiring in other countries than have
    the countries themselves Consequently its discouraging attitude toward peace
    being preserved abroad may have been well-grounded It has been hopeful but
    by no means sanguine G etting our own folks out o f the countries in which
    war threatens is another task o f the State department There are thousands o
    f our tourists in European countries getting their thrills which many o f
    them seem to feel our own land cannot a fford them There are others who
    prefe r to live abroad upon their Am erican incomes W hen a crisis occurs
    over there they all want to hurry back to safe and sound America The past
    couple o f weeks they have been crow ding into various ports and trying to
    find vessels which will bring them back The State department and its
    embassies and consulates abroad have the jo b o f helping them obtain
    passage There are other departments which the threat o f w ar abroad are
    causing m ore than average concern The T reasury department in particular
    has its great currency stabilization fund at w ork in foreign capitals The
    extent o f its operations is not revealed from time to time Foreign
    currencies are feeling the e ffe ct o f the crisis and our own m oney is at
    a premium in some foreign capitals All currencies are m ore or less a
    ffected by war The countries in which war now is threatened are in- Robert

    debted to our governm ent m ore than a dozen billions Nome o f the borrowing
    powers has paid even the interest on the debt except Finland The Treasury
    department will not expect any payments at this time It might do a good job
    however by issuing a daily bulletin to be widely circulated calling
    attention to the debts due from the last war It might help in reminding
    folks that another war will cost us as much or more if we do not keep out o
    f it The Agricultural department plans also are upset In case hostilities
    ensue there will be no more subsidized shipments o f wheat or cotton to
    foreign lands The program fo r cotton barter may be carried through
    hurriedly in exchange fo r the rubber bargained for but it will not be
    extended The Department experts are also busy figuring out whether it may
    becom e necessary to conserve farm products as was done in the W orld war
    The experts should realize one thing in their consideration and that is that
    our farm ers will never again tolerate the sort o f price fixing which was
    imposed upon them in 1917 and 1918 to the enrichment o f the speculators in
    our own and other lands They had enough o f that in the tw o-year period to
