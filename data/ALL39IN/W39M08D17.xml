County Clerks to Issue Auto Tags?
Whether or not Wisconsin’s 71
county clerks issue automobile license
plates rather than the secretary o f
state’s office is now Governor H eil’s
problem. The senate last week concurred
with the assembly in a bill
which authorizes this change.
A few weeks ago the senate had
moved to indefinitely postpone the bill,
but a reconsideration motion prevailed
and the senate finally concurred by
an 18-10 vote. The measure whs vigorouslv
opposed by Secretary of State
Fred Zimmerman who believes that it
is contrary to the administration’s
nresent nolicy o f centralizing functions
and responsibility, and that it
will complicate a registration system
that is now operating efficiently.
Governor Heil's position on the bill
is not known. Identical bills have been
vetoed by Govornors Schmedeman,
Kohler, and La Follette.
Clean License Plates
A statewide drive to force Wisconsin
drivers to keen their license nlates
elean and readable mav be «tarted,
Secretary o f State Fred R. Zimmerman
has indicated.
When the 1930 license plates were!
manufactured and painted, the oil was |
eliminated from the white naint form ula
in order to eet a nnre white, but
the resulting paint would not stand un
under weathering, and soon motorists
heean to eomnlair nbout the n^’ nt
washiner awav. About 150 complaint*
are received daily bv the motor licence
division, and in each case drivers are
asked to send in their plates for repainting.
Meanwhile the division sent
them temporary driving permits.
All motorists, however, have not
made efforts to correct defective
plates, and consequently manv cars
are being driven with plates tha? are
scarcelv le«rrble. Z’ mmerman fears
that hit and run drivers or traffic violators
may escape prosecution because
their plates cannot be read.
To correct the situation as much as
possible he is considering asking- law
enforcement officials to “ bear down”
on motorists wlio have defective plates
and are not doimr anything about it.
He also said that “ it would he helpful”
if persons would do the repair work
themselves.
13.217 State Employees
Republican administration leaders
have been taking turns discussing leg islative
and state government problems
over a state chain or radio
stations the past few weeks. One of
the most recent talks was delivered bv
Lieutenant-Governor Goodland, presiding
officer o f the Senate.
Goodland’s speech centered on the
cost o f state government. He announced
that Heil had already slashed
more than a million dollars from state
government administration costs and
predicted that such costs would be
further reduced.
The problem o f increased personnel
in state service was inherited hy the
Heil administration. Goodland said.
“ Figures given by the bureau of
personnel show that the average
number o f employes o f the state in
1935 was 10,115 with a monthly average
payroll o f $1,206,860. The average
for 1938 was 13,217 emploves and a
monthly payroll o f $1,610,285.
“ During all these years our state
government has been constantly expanding.
It has been digging in and
throwing up protective screens backed
bv a powerful civil service department.
The office holders are determined to
hold their jobs and not to yield control
o f government they have created. You
can take my word for it, they constitute
a powerful pressure group.”
Discussing the factor o f opposition
to reorganization and economy by the
slate employe lobbyists the Lieut.-
Governor referred to a recent attempt
by Governor Heil to cut state employe
vacations with pay from three to two
weeks. The measure passed the senate
but was defeated in the assembly.
“ E very state official has gone
through every day o f the depression
without loss o f time or pay. They
could cheerfully accept this one week
vacation loss. How many farmers or
laborers ever get two weeks vacation,
with or without pay? Y e t the farm ers
and laborers help pay taxes that pay
the salaries o f the state employes/
Goodland stated.
Oleo. Trade Barrier
The state oleomargarine tax, a bone
o f contention for the past three legislative
sessions, popped up again when
Assemblyman Anthony Gruszka, Republican,
assailed it as a creation o f
“ political apportunists” and the nation’s
number one trade barrier.
Gruszka stated that the tax has
caused 13 southern states to pass restrictive
laws against Wisconsin dairy
products. He also pointed out that
the presence of the tax has not raised
dairy prices, since prices have fallen in
the eight years it has been in effect.
The tax, he said, has caused an embargo
in the south against all W isconsin
products, and resulted in increased
unemployment in the state.
Governor Heil and other Republicans
have expressed the same sentiments
concerning the tax, but as yet no leg islative
action concerning it has taken
place.
Advisory Cheese Board
The state department of agriculture
and markets wUl be advised concerning
a program fo r the state’s foreign
type cheese industry by a committee
to which 18 men have just been appointed.
The committee has been created
under a statutory provision which
allows the department director, with
the approval o f the board o f agriculture,
to set up advisory committees of
this kind.
On the committee are H arvey Thew,
Madison; Fred W enger and J. H.
Burke, Darlington; Clarence Kubly,
A l Stoldt and Fred Glauser, Mon*>e:
Matt Marty, M att Bissack and Emil
Escher, Monticello; M. O. Monson,
John Chapman and A. L. Andrew,
South Wayne; R. J. Douglas and Wm.
N. Preston. Juda; A lfred Muller and
W illiam Kittleson, Mount Horeb; E.
H. Conley, Barneveld; and John Erb,
Rice Lake.
Cut M ile Rate
The rate per mile paid to state,
county and municipal employee fo r the
use of their automobiles would be
sharply cut under a bill introduced by
Senator Jesse M. Peters, Republican.
Before 1938 the state paid seven
cents a mile bo employes fo r the use
o f their automobiles, but Governor La
F ollette’* executive council cut the
rate five cent* a mile up to 600 miles.
Senator Peters’ bill cuts the rate to
five cents per mile up to 250 miles,

T IB E T A N S A L U T E
In Tibet when one man greets
another it goes beyond the mere shaking
of hands. A Tibetan bows, extends
both hands palm* open and sticks out
his tongue! This means that he is a
friend! He has no knives in his
hands and no evil words on his tongue!
The sticking out o f the tongue part
o f the salute interested me the most.
Few of us go about with knives in
our hands but many o f us have words
as sharp as knives on our tongues!
With those words we can say cutting
things which make others unhappy,
discouraged, fearful. We can ruin
careers, set man against man, create
jealousies and destroy as viciously
as a soldier with a sword.
I like the Tibetan idea. I f we would
enter our relations with men with no
evil words on our tongues, if we
would learn to speak well o f others
or remain silent, if we would refrain
from intolerant, bitter and unkind remarks
what a changed world this
would be!
O f course, sticking out one's tongue
has another meaning in America. We
don’t want to have people think we
are giving them the Bronx Cheer!
But we can follow the Tibetan idea of
disarming our tongues without showing
them And that’s all that counts!

*'It speaks for itself,” said Franklin
R oosevelt in Latin a fter the
house refused on roll call to pass
his $800,000,000 bill expanding F H A ’ s
lending power. T o both house and
senate he forw arded “ m y good

Then he bundled up som e 350 lastminute
bills and left for H yde Park
while his loyal friend from Florida,
Sen. Claude Pepper, was holding up
adjournment by denouncing the “ unrighteous
partnership (D em ocratic-
G. O. P. coalition) of those who have
been w illin g to scuttle the Am erican

peace of the world ^because they hate

PO L IT IC S:
Truths
Open for public inspection this
month are two great, pertinent political
truths: (1 ) That the right kind
o f publicity can turn a third rater
into a first-rate presidential candidate
almost overnight; ( 2) that today
as always, public sentiment is
sufficiently pliable to make room for
any new face
that m ay pop
up. The cone
l u s i o n s :
F ir s t , th a t

r e l a t i o n s
w o r k ; s e c *
i o n d, t h a t
1940’s e l e c tion
is not in
the bag for
any man.
Cause of this excitem ent is Paul
V. M cNutt, who popped back from
the Philippines two months ago, got
his handsome picture in the papers,
was called a “ charm ing young
m an” by President Roosevelt, then
ended up by getting him self named
federal security administrator.
F rom here he m ay develop into the
President’s crow n prince.
In June Candidate McNutt ranked
fifth among D em ocratic hopefuls as
tabulated by .highly accurate Gallup
polls. In order: Garner, 47 per cent;
F arley, 16, Hull, 12; Hopkins, 5;
McNutt, 3. Six w eeks after his federal
appointment, Paul M cNutt had
jumped to second place. Jack G arner,
still w ell in the lead, suffered a
m ite. The standings: Garner, 46
per cent; M cNutt, 13; Hull, 12, F a r ley,
12; Hopkins, 3.
Other political news: Ohio’ s Sen.
Robert Alphonso T aft, bad trailer in
G. O. P . Gallup polls, becam e the
first to toss his hat in the ring.
While finding his senatorial office
“ interesting,” Candidate T a ft m agnanimously
agreed not to ‘ ‘run away
from a harder job .”
RACES:
One Way Out
Since last M arch thousands of
Czecho-Slovakian Jews have fled to
the U. S. on visitors' permits, their
property confiscated, their only hope
lying in refuge on some distant land.
Sometimes even this hope is futile.
Within two days the U. S. had this
problem brought shockingly to mind
tw ice:
C. In Chicago, 4.1-year-old Mrs. Adele
Lan ger (w ife o f a Czech Jew whose
$1,500,000 textile m ills had been confiscated),
took quarters in a Loop
hotel with her two sons, six and four.
L a te that night she threw her sons
from the thirteenth floor window,
slashed her w rists and jumped.
C In N ew Y ork , Germ an R efugee
Albert Aaron, whose w ife died two
weeks ea rlier from an overdose of
sleeping tablets, hung him self from
his apartm ent door.

LOUISIANA:
Hot Oil
Heaped atop several score other
indictments facin g prominent Louisianans
was a fed era l charge against
fo rm er Gov. Richard Leche, whose
fe et had heretofore been kept clear
o f the muck surrounding state offlcialdom.
The indictment: Charging
Leche. Po litician Seymour Weiss
and Freem an Burford, Texas oil
man, with stepping up production
of Rodessa oil w ells and running thc
contraband or "h o t” oil o v er into
Texas, violating the Connally act.
IN T ER N A T IO N A L :
Chess Came
For two months jitte ry F rance and
Britain have forecast another “ c risis”
in August or September. As
August was born, it indeed looked
like a crisis in which Japan had become
of great nuisance value to
A dolf H itler and Benito Mussolini.
What bothered Am ericans w as that
their own nation seemed being
drawn into this chess gam e as a result
of justified U. S. retaliation
against insults in the F a r East.
At Ita ly ’s Lake Como was played
the key m ove in this gam e. There
m et Toshio Shiratori, Japanese ambassador
to Rom e, and Lieut. Gen.
Matahiko Oshima, ambassador to
Berlin. Their purpose: T o perfect
a m ilitary alliance binding Japan
AM B ASSAD O R S H IR A T O R I
He voued hara-kiri.
with Ita ly and Germ any. I f it failed,
said their friends, the ambassadors
had vowed to com m it hara-kiri (suicide
by disem bowelm ent). Simultaneously,
at Tokyo, youngish arm y
leaders began a d rive to purge foes
o f the m ilitary alliance.
Meanwhile there was e v ery indication
these three powers w ere doing
their best to confuse and frigh ten
not only France, Britain and Russia
(w ho opened joint m ilitary conferences
in M oscow ) but also the
U. S. Sharp on the heels o f U. S.
abrogation of the Jap trade treaty
had come anti-Am erican and anti-
British demonstrations in China. Jap
airships destroyed two Y an gtze riv er
steamers. At Tientsin a mob destroyed
offices o f the British In ternational
Export corporation. With
dem ocracies’ attention shifted away
from Europe for the moment, the
axis exerted pressure on Spain and
the Balkan states, dragging them
into line should Europe becom e em broiled
in war.
While Washington tried desperately
to rem ain aloof. P rim e M inister
Chamberlain told the house o f commons
he m ight have to send a powerful
fleet to Asia. M ore interesting
to Am ericans, how ever, w as the proposal
of Laborite John M organ that
British and A m erican A siatic fleets
be combined under a U. S. adm iral
to keep order in the Orient. Said
he: ‘ ‘I would regard it as a firstclass
m ove.”
A G R ICU LTU R E:
Barter
Forgotten by surplus-ridden U. S.
lard producers is the humorous situation
several years ago when they
bartered lard for Germ an machinery,
finding them selves holding several
thousand musical but useless
harmonicas. Today G erm any still
needs lard, for which she w ill pay
60 per cent above the present dom
estic price of 5 to 5 Vi cents a
pound.
Contrary to the state departm ent’ s
reciprocal trade program is the barter
plan producers would now institute.
Rebuffed by Secretary of State
Cordell Hull, producers and German
barter em issaries turned to the
treasury department where Undersecretary
John W. Hanes agreed to
a hearing. The plan, which obviously
seeks legal circumvention o f very
definite foreign trade regulations, is
something like this:
U. S. packers, having arranged a
transaction in Germ any, would sell
lard to an Am erican im porting firm,
which would trade it to private G erman
buyers for ‘ ‘ askim arks,” usable
only in that country. The im porter
would then purchase Germ an
products now on the U. S. fre e list,
paying in G erm any money about
one-fourth what he would pay elsewhere.
Products, turned over to
lard producers here, would be
la rgely of farm nature: M achinery,
cream separators and fertilizer.

W A SH IN G TO N . — Certain unheralded
events in the Triple A o f Henry
A. W a llace’s department o f a griculture
had a lot to do with the
surge o f sentiment which pushed the
Hatch bill through the house despite
the most frantic efforts of the White
House to stop it.
The events had all the earm arks
of planning to use the entire rela tionship
between the departm ent
and the fa rm ers o f the country as
a political machine. N atu rally,
m em bers of the house and senate
began to hear the rumblings, but for
some tim e they could not m ake head
or tail o f them.
At first, the politicos on Capitol
H ill assumed that the politics that
was obviously being
played was in behalf
of H enry W allace’ s
own presidential am bitions.
It seemed,
as it was told up under
the big dome,
that N. E. Dodd, in
a speech to the em ployees
o f the w estern
division— revised
version o f the old
wheat section o f pres
o il c o n s e r v a t i o n
days— laid a great
deal o f emphasis on his own idea
that the jobs in the departm ent
ought to go to “ fa rm ers.” H e also
irritated the clerks summoned to
hear his oratory, many of whom had
c iv il service status which contained
no credits fo r m ilking cows or pitching
hay. by telling them the d iffe rence
between “ people” and “ folks.”
“ Folks,” one gathered, w ere the
sterling sons o f the West—anywhere
w est o f the Mississippi. “ P e o p le”
w ere the city slickers who lived east
of the Father o f Waters. W hatever
he m eant, he scare d the eastern,
i non-horny handed clerks quite a liti
tie, and some o f them made straightj
w ay to their senators and representatives,
wanted to be assured that
I congress would not perm it them to
be thrown out on their ears to make
w ay for the only sort of “ folks”
that M r. Dodd seemed to like.
W isconsin Senator First
T o Sound Off in Pu blic
In explaining their fears, they told
o f what had been happening in T r iple
A , with the western division apparently
the worst sore spot.
But it was not confined to the
w estern division. Some of the constituents
o f Sen. A lexander W iley of
Wisconsin went running to him with
their troubles, and it happened that
he was the first man on Capitol H ill
to sound off publicly. Which, cou- i
pled with the fact that the cutting off
o f c iv il service heads among the ex ecutives,
plus the appointment o f politica
lly (presum ably) recom m ended
persons to take their places, was
w orse in the western division,
caused several mixups.
One was the general assumption
as a result that Wisconsin was in
the western division. On the contrary,
apparently the W olverines are
“ people” not “ folks.” M aybe that
is w hy Senator W iley got so mad.
Just in passing, no one understands
why the boundary lines o f this w estern
division are drawn as they are.
It ’s just one of the absurdities
that g rew out of beating the devil
round the stump, turning T rip le A
paym ents into soil-conservation payments,
after the Supreme court,
back in its palmy days, tossed the
Th ree A ’s out the window.
But the reports o f these frigh tened
clerks, added together, w ere
little short of shocking to the congressmen.
They want to do the
naming of the new em ployees, and
they want the right to protect the
old employees.
So the notion of a high-powered
political machine being built up
from Washington, directed from
Washington, and operated without
their knowledge—w ell, the Hatch bill
isn't such a bad idea!
M ajor Problems Shifted Onto
N ext Session of Congress
With most of its m ajor problem s
postponed—neutrality, new taxes,
amendments to the w age hour and
labor relations act, and a half dozen
others—congress is m erely putting
off the ev il da y—and putting it off,
o f all things, to the session which
w ill not only be in a presidential
election year, but which w ill run
right into the conventions o f both
parties that w ill nominate their candidates
for President.
Buring the session which began
last January, Republicans and conserva
tive Democrats, despite plenty
o f denials, w ere steadily working
towards a coalition. Som etim es it
functioned and sometimes it did not.
Som etim es it worked in the house
and did not in the senate. At other
tim es it spiked the guns of the leaders
in the senate but somehow did
not seem to function in the house.
On the whole, it was m ore effective
in the house, perhaps because
the Republican organization w a*
much tigh ter in the house. Republican
representatives w ere much
m ore docile under the leadership of
Joe M artin, the G. O. P. house lead- !
er, than w ere the m inority senators
under Sen. Charles M cN ary. But
this m eans very little save that the
house leadership was skillful and the
house Republicans w illing to be on j
the jo b when told to be, for senators
are proverbially m ore individualistic
than m em bers o f the house.
In the senate e v ery m em ber is a
power in his own right. H e can
hold up bills, he can force amendments
if they are not too important.
H e can do all sorts o f things. But
in the house the only power that can
be exercised by individual m embers,
save on ve ry close roll calls, is by
combining in groups— hence the necessity
fo r organization if the individuals
are to accomplish anything.
Tendency Toward C oalition
Is Threat at W hite House
But the interesting factor in this
tendency toward coalition of the R e publicans
and the conservative
Dem ocrats is that it has been d eveloping—
growing with the passage of
every w eek to be m ore and m ore a
threat to the White House domination
o f congress.
Th ere is no such thing as a definite
group of Dem ocrats in either
house or senate who can be counted
on to vote against President Roosevelt
with the Republicans.
The rea l im portance, now, is for
the future— where this coalition w ill
be next session—how it w ill develop.
If there should happen to be a specia
l election anywhere, the prim ary,
or the election, or both might have
a profound effect. But without such
guideposts for the politicians who
compose the two houses everything
w ill continue to depend on whether
R oosevelt runs for a third term.
This m akes it a bit foggy, for no
announcement is expected on that
until the session which meets in January
gets w ell under w ay—perhaps
not even until the convention starts
balloting in June.
So the prospect would seem to be
that there w ill be a continuance, at
least in the ea rly days o f the session
beginning in January, o f the present
loosely knit coalition.
M ove to Capture Texas
j Delegation for Roosevelt
A cting on the advice of friendly
Texans who insist that the delegation
from the Lone Star state to the
next D em ocratic convention can be
captured for Franklin D. Roosevelt
despite the fact that John Nance
G arner w ill be a fa vorite son, the
W hite House is m oving to consolidate
its political forces down by the
R io Grande, not to mention up in
the Panhandle or “ back E ast” in
Texarkana.
The latest m ove was tke tender of
the post o f head of the rural electrification
administrator
to Rep. Lyndon B.
Johnson of the Tenth
Texas district. A fter
weighing the offer
for some time Johnson
turned it down,
the whole proceeding
being kept very
quiet indeed.
But the striking
angle of the affair
was that this offer
of the appointment
w as m ade without
regard to the wishes o f Secretary of
| Agriculture Henry A. W allace. The
; secretary, to whose jurisdiction R.
| E. A . w as given in the reorganiza-
I tion, has been much concerned about
I who should head it. H e particularly
! wanted a man with a farm backi
ground, and m ade his wishes known
not only to the President, but to
everyone who would listen to him.
He has been considerably annoyed
by the w ay R. E. A., prior to its
being put under him, had attempted
to build electric lines apparently
with a view to developing the use
o f m arginal lands. W allace has been
fighting for years to elim inate the
| poorer, or so-called m arginal lands,
| from agricultural use as one means
| of raising the condition of the farm -
! ers and at the sam e tim e reducing
| the production o f surplus crops.
But the President m erely informed
W allace that he intended to offer
the place to Johnson, without asking
his advice or wishes.
The appointment was and is a
| pretty nice plum.
! Garner People to ‘Smoke Out*
\ Some Texas Congressmen
It is also interesting in that Johnson,
since the defeat of Maury M a verick,
is the most left wing o f the
T exas delegation in the House. A s a
m atter of fact he is a close personal
and political friend pf M averick, who
has been touring the country giving
out statements that tend to build up
R oosevelt and to belittle G am er.
Some of the G arner people got on
to the negotiations, and are very
sore about it. Th ey have been intending
to “ smoke out” various T e x as
congressmen and force them to
take a position either for Garner or
for the third term for Roosevelt.
Actually they have no doubt whatev
er that they w ill have a solid G a rner
delegation from Texas.
Only four states, N ew York. Pennsylvania,
Illinois and Ohio have
m ore votes on a roll call to nominate
a presidential candidate at the national
D em ocratic conclave.
But it is almost a political axiom
that a presidential candidate must
have his own state solidly behind
him.

No. 1793 is a perfect dream o f a
dress fo r slim young girls, who
look especially sw eet in high necke-

on Indian culture.
Ly in g in the astronom er's
background is the little red
school house whence so many
eminent Am ericans have come
to take significant part in the
life o f this nation. This particula
r seat o f elem entary learning
was in Ohio, and there at 17 he
had graduated from student to
teacher. One sum m er during
his ca ree r as a youthful pedagogue
he registered fo r the summ
er course at Ohio N orm al, and
there an incident occurred destined
to alfect his life. He
looked through a telescope. He
just looked, that was all, and
then returned to the m ore im portant
task of getting an education.
But even in later years, *
as a graduate student at Johns
Hopkins, working for a doctor’ s
degree, that peep through a telescope
of no extraordinary power,
yet larger than any glass
he had ev er before seen, lingered
in his mind and intrigued
him.
H e becam e affiliated with the
A m erican Museum of Natural History
in 1913, and while much o f his
w ork w as concerned with this earth,
its flora, fauna, fish and other manifestations
o f nature, he found tim e
as president o f the Am ateu r Astronom
ers association to search the
heavens, and is credited with having
done m ore than any fellow astronom
er to popularize the science
through presentation in term s o f lay
understanding.
His mundane expeditions have
Included many rem ote and mysterious
regions. With Carveth
W ells he tw ice traversed littleknown
Swedish and N orw egian
Lapland, making valuable m oving
pictures. N ew Y orkers and
untold thousands of visitors to
the m etropolis w ill know him
best as curator of the Hayden
planetarium.
X \ T H E N Miss Lillian Spalding was

A rt of Baieball as a flrs‘ baf ‘ m an who let
nothing o f importance in the way
o f thrown or batted balls get by her,
and she poled out m any a lusty
d rive.
When she cam e to long skirts,
as the saying used to be, she
had to g iv e up baseball, but
love for the sport was firm ly
established in her. As teacher
in an elem entary school in
Th ree R ivers, she watched with
pain and with cumulative repugnance
the efforts of her boys to
express the national pastime.
But, herself being a sandlot product,
there was nothing much she
could do about it. T im e then
cam e when she was elevated to
the post o f principal, and last
yea r she cam e to N ew York as
a student in the summer season
of teachers' college, Columbia
university, working toward a

year, she registered for the

Common Sense
A bout Constipation
A doctor would tell you that the
best tiling to do with constipation
Is get at its cause. That way you
don't have to endure It flrst and
try to cure it afterward-you can
avoid having it.
Chances are you won’t have to
look far for the cause if you eat
the super-refined foods most
people do. Most likely you don’t
get enough ‘ bulk’ ! And "bulk”
doesn't mean a lot of food. It
means a kind of food that isn’t
consumed in the body, but
leaves a soft “ bulky” mass in the
intestines.
I f this is what you lack, try
crisp crunchy Kellogg’s All-Bran
for breakfast. It contains Just the
“ bulk” you need.
Eat All-Bran every day, drink
plenty of water, and “ Join the
Regulars.” Made by Kellogg's in
Battle Creek. Sold by every grocer.

Tope nodded, and he asked after
a m om ent: “ Do you know whether
the front door was bolted or locked,
the night your mother died, before
you went to bed?”
“ Y e s ,” June said. “ U ncle Justus
bolted it. Th at's why, when the
door blew open, it scared me. I
knew it had been fastened, and I
thought there must be someone in
the house. But 1 didn’t w ait to—
find out. I just ran.”
“ Mr. Taine bolted it, did he?”
Tope repeated thoughtfully.
She said: “ Y es, after Mother was
in bed, I cam e to the head o f the
stairs, and I heard him tell G randpa
Hurder the door was fa st.” She
rem em b ered ' suddenly: “ And he
tried to slip upstairs during the ev ening
before Mother died. Aunt E vie
saw him, called him back.”
Tope was silent for a moment,
and he asked then a new question:
“ I f you went back, where would
they likely have you sta y?”
“ Th ere isn’ t any room at Aunt
E v ie ’s,” June explained. “ I t ’s just
a sm all house, you know. I ’d have
to stay at Grandm a Bowdon’s.”
“ T h ey ’ ve put Mr. Hurder upstairs,
in the Bowdon house,” Tope reported.
“ Th e back room on the west
sid e.”
“ T h at’s a spare room ,” June assented.
“ Grandpa and Grandm a
Bowdon used the east room s.”
“ I f you go out there, then, you’d
probably have the front room on
the west side.”
“ I suppose so.”
“ I ’d want you to try to arrange
to take care of him ,” Tope told her.
“ T o sit up with him tonight— in the
room with him .” H e considered.
“ They m ay not let you; but if you’ re
in the next room , you can hear, listen.”
“ The stairs are betw een,” she
said. “ But the doors are just across
the hall, opposite one another.”
“ A re there locks on the doors in
that house?” Tope asked gravely.
“ Locks, yes ,” June said. “ Th ere
are locks everyw h ere. Even the
closets are locked. Grandm a Bowdon
alw ays carries a bunch of keys
on her belt.”
Clint said u rgently: “ Inspector,
I ’m going to have a ladder ready,
so I can get up to her room, g et in
the window if I have to.”
“ Y e s ,” Tope said seriously.
“ T h at’s good. Or so she can get
out and down to us, quickly, if anyone
tries to get at her. And I ’ ll
giv e her a revolver, show her
how—”
The telephone interrupted him,
and M iss Moss went to answer it.
She turned to say softly, her hand
over the rec eive r: “ I t ’s for June.”
So June crossed to the older w om an’s
side; she took the telephone in
her hand. Th ey heard her say:
“ Hello. Y e s . . . Y es , Grandm
a .”
And a fter a long tim e: “ Y e s . . .
Y es, I ’ m com in g.”
And then: “ Y es . . . Th ey w ill
bring m e out, in a little w hile.”
Clint fe lt his pulses pound with a
deep terro r; but he could not check
her now. A m oment later she said,
“ Y e s ,” again, and put the instrument
down and faced them all.
“ That was Grandm a Bowdon,”
she explained. “ Grandpa Bowdon’s
funeral is this afternoon, late. She
wants m e to be there, and to go
home with them a fterw a rd .” She
added slow ly: “ Th at’s what I w ill
do.”
In the preparations that followed,
Clint’s hopeless protests w ere all
overborne. June’s dress, that new
dress Asa had given her, was sooted
and soiled. Miss Moss m ade Clint
drive her to the nearest shop, and
they brought home two or three
dresses for trial, found one that
would serve. When they thus returned,
Inspector Tope had rumm
aged out his old rev o lve r and was
explaining to June its sim ple mechpnism
before she left for the funeral.
The ritual was scarce finished before
Mrs. Taine cam e sw iftly toward
them. “ It is hard fo r m e to fo rg iv e
you for this, June,” Aunt E v ie told
the girl, in her low, whispering tones.
“ You have added much to the burden
w e have all had to bear today.”
Clint saw Rab guiding old Mrs.
Bowdon to their c a r; he heard June
say ca lm ly : “ This is M r. Jervies,
Aunt E v ie .” Her eyes m et C lint’s,
and she added proudly: “ I ’m going
to m arry him. I ’ ll stay with you
as long as you need me, if it isn’ t
too long; but then I ’ m going to
him .”
“ That is as m ay be,” Mrs. Taine
comm ented. “ Such m atters are not
decided so quickly, June.”
Then Asa cam e up beside her. He
draw led cheerfully: “ Hullo, June.
Hullo, Jervies. June, with a man
like this one to take ca re o f you,
you’d better hang on to him .”
Mrs. Taine said softly: “ A s a !”
The w ord hissed on her tongue.
Asa looked at Clint. “ W hy don’t
you keep her, J erv ies? ” he suggested
insistently.
Clint cried: “ I want t o !”
But Mrs. Taine said: “ Come,
child.” She took June’s a rm ; Clint
saw her fingers tighten crueliy. H e
started forw ard, but June freed herself,
and she said ca lm ly:
“ I ’ m com ing, Aunt E v ie. You
need not hold m e !’ *
And she nodded to Clint in a deep
reassurance, and led the w ay tow
ard the w aiting car.
Tope had prom ised to m eet Clint
beside the road, on the w ay up
Kenesaw H ill, as soon as it should
be dark. It w as still no m ore than
dusk when Clint took the road up
the h ill; but at an angle the Inspector
stepped out to halt him.
“ D octor C ab ler’s at the house,”
he said. “ He and Mr. Taine stayed
with M r. Hurder during the funeral.
I w ant to see him when he leaves.
Go ahead, over the top o f the h ill.”
Clint obeyed; and Tope explained:
“ H eale can’t be here. H e’s laid up
— a bad cold from last night. But
he’s lending us a couple of m en.”
And he said, half to him self:
“ H ere are two wom en killed. A
“ Mrs. Taine is giving her a
glass of milk.”
man don’ t often kill a woman unless
he loves her, or has loved h er.”
Th ey passed the two houses which
still stood atop the h ill; but Clint
scarce noticed them. “ You mean
M r. L ea fo rd ? ” he cried, in incredulous
astonishment.
“ But a woman don’ t mind killing
another w om an,” said the Inspector
g rim ly , as though finishing his
thought; and Clint looked at him
with w ide startled eyes.
B efore he could speak the question
in his mind, a man appeared
in their headlights, a policem an in
uniform ; and they stopped. Tope
opened the ca r door.
“ Hello, Rand,” he said. “ Doctor
still th ere?”
Th e policem an nodded. “ And I ’ve
got the ladder,” he reported. “ Hid
it o ver in the woods.”
“ Good m an,” Tope approved, and
they got out and waited, till presently
Doctor C abler in his ca r cam e
down the road. He stopped at a
signal, and Tope spoke to him apart
in low to^es. When the Doctor
drove on, the Inspector returned to
them, and he explained:
“ Mr. Hurder is better! Tom orrow
w ill tell the tale, whether he’s going
to live. The Doctor thinks he w ill.
H e’s given the old man something
to make him sleep.”
The house on this side all was
dark, except that there w as a lighted
window in the kitchen. Tope was
at the rear corner there. The window-
blind was drawn; but by m oving
out a little from the house, Cl^nt
could see a rectangle of light where
the window was. Some one was preparing
supper — talking, probably.
Tope stood just below the window,
as though listening.
Inaction began to madden him,
when at last there cam e an incident
to relieve the strain: a door
opened; someone cam e out.
Clint saw that this must be Justus
Taine, a heavy figure o f a man,
w alking with head bowed. He saw
this man pause yonder by the ashfilled
cellar o f the Hurder house
and stand for a moment beside the
pit as though in some dark recovery,
before he went on.
L a te r a light appeared in the
Taine house, behind a curtained
window ; then nothing happened for
a while.
Clint had tim e for thought, and
he rem em bered his own suspicions
of Justus Taine, and was glad Taine
was no longer here in the house
with June. But—Tope had dismissed
C lint’s theory, and the young man
rem em bered this, and his nerves
drew taut again. When someone
touched his elbow, he leaped like a
startled horse, ready to c ry out, but
Tope w hispered:
“ Hush, steady, son!”
Clint nodded; he tried to speak,
but his vo ice croaked dangerously.
H e lifted the ladder. Tope helping
him ; and they leaned it a g iin s t the
window-sili above them without
sound.
Clint clim bed it instantly; he
stopped with his head level with the
sill. Since there was no light in
the room , he could not see whether
the shade was draw n or not; but
he w aited, striving to peer into the
blackness behind the glass.
Once he looked down cautiously,
and saw T o p e’s round figure huddled
at the foot o f the ladder, T o p e’s
round fa ce w atchfully upturned.
H e then saw June and Mrs. Taine
com e in, June with a lighted candle.
Behind them he saw Rab and
Asa in the hall, and Mrs. Bowdon’s
am ple form .
And then his heart suddenly was
in his throat; for Mrs. Taine had a
glass of m ilk in her hand.
Mrs. Lea fo rd had drunk a glass
of m ilk that night she died; the Hur-^
ders too. Th ere was to Clint something
hideous and sinister in this innocent
b evera ge now. He took an
im pulsive step higher, his hand
raised to break the window in.
But Tope below him hissed a
w arning; and Clint leaned down to
w hisper desp erately: “ Mrs. Taine is
givin g her a glass of m ilk !”
“ She won’ t drink it,” Tope prom ised.
“ I warned her not to drink
anything, or eat anything except
what the others did.”
And Mrs. Taine suddenly, still
talking, withdrew.
June did not m ove. She watched
the door. Clint w aited, his pulse
racing.
Then, after a long minute, Tope
w hispered: “ D ow n !”
Clint was on the ground in an instant;
and Tope breathed in his ea r;
“ The door.”
Clint at first did not understand.
Then he heard the click of a latch,
and toward the rear o f the house a
figure did appear— Mrs. Taine, he
guessed. She walked briskly away.
Th ey saw her figure in silhouette
against the light when she opened
the kitchen door of her own home
yonder and went in.
Then Clint started to clim b the
ladder again.
“ C arefu l,” the old man warned
him. “ Don’ t show you rself above
the window-sill. She m ight see you
from over there.”
But Clint could not resist looking
once to be sure June was unharmed.
H e saw her carefully propping a
chair under the door-knob; saw
that the m ilk stayed untasted. She
secured the door, and then blew
out the candle, and so cam e to the
w indow and opened it. She leaned
here above him , and he W'hispered:
“ A ll right, June?”
“ Y e s ,” she said slowly. “ But
Aunt E v ie g a v e m e a glass of—
w arm m ilk. T o m ake m e sleep,
she said. I prom ised to drink it
when I w as in bed.”
“ She’s gone hom e,” Clint told her
reassuringly.
“ H om e?” the g irl exclaim ed.
“ She said she w as going to stay with
him. H e’s all alone. I ’ m going in— ”
“ N o,” Clint insisted. “ R ab and
Asa are still in the house. And she’s
com ing back. G ive m e that m ilk,
June. I want Tope to taste it.”
She brought the glass and g a v e it
to him. He said: “ I ’ ll be right here.
A ll night.”
“ P o or d a rlin g !” she whispered.
“ In the rain.”
“ N ea r you,” he told her. ” 1 shan’t
fe el it.”
H e took the m ilk down to Inspector
Tope. Th e old man dipped a
finger into it, touched the finger 10
his lips. “ Can’t taste anything,” he
said. “ But I ’ ll send Rand to have
it tested, right now.’ ’ And he directed:
“ You stay h e re !”
Clint nodded, and Tope started
away. He m oved past the corn er of
the house; and suddenly, when he
was six paces off, he stumbled over
something lying in the uncut grass,
and fell heavily. Clint heard the
breath go out of him with a grunt.
The young man m oved sw iftly tow
ard him ; but before he could come
to T o p e’s side, the Inspector was
on his hands and knees.
Clint w hispered: “ H urt?”
And Tope said gra v ely : “ T h ere’s
another ladder here. I tripped o ver
it.’ ’ He added ruefully: “ Spilled the
m ilk. T h at’s b a d !”
“ Another ladder?” Clint echoed.
Th ere w as a dreadful clam or in his
ears, his ow n pulse was pounding
so.
Then from the window above
them, June called ve ry softly:
“ Clint, dear, are you there? A re
you all rig h t? ”
“ Y es, sw eet,” he whispered.
“ What happened?” she asked.
“ The Inspector fell down,” he said
reassuringly. “ Didn’t hurt him I”
He clim bed to her Window, and her
arm s held him fast, her lips trem bling
against his own. “ You mustn’t
be a fraid ,” h e ’ urged.
“ I ’ m com ing back to you tom orrow
,” she declared.
“ F o r good and all,” he agreed.
She said w istfully: “ You could
com e in here, out of the rain.” And
she u rged: “ T h ey ’ ve left Grandpa
Hurder all alone. I want to go to
him .”
But he said sternly: “ No. M aybe
that’s what they want you to do.
You stay here. If anyone tries
to open your door— ’ ’ He kissed her
again. “ Good night, sw eet,” he
said. “ And sleep sound.”
H e descended to the ground once
more. “ M r. H u rder’s alone,” he reported
to Tope. “ She wants to go
to him. I wouldn’t let her.”
Then June spoke, whispering,
above their heads; and Clint was up
the ladder in a bound.
“ Rab and Asa have gone into
Grandpa’s room ,” she explained.
“ Asa wants to stay with Grandpa;
but R a b ’ s arguing about it. I can
hear them talk ing.”
She turned her head at some
sound in the hall, whispered,
“ Hush,” and crossed to listen at
the door. Clint, even from where he
was, could hear the murmur o f
their voices. Then this sound receded,
and June returned to him.
“ T h e y 're going,” she reported.
“ Asa said he had to go to town later
tonight, and he wanted to stand his
turn with Grandpa now, and let Rab
and Aunt E v ie sleep. But Rab insisted
it w as all right to leave
Grandpa, insisted that they both go
hom e.”
“ I ’ll tell T op e,” Clint assured her,
and looked down. But Tope had
vanished.
She urged in shaken tones: “ I
want to see if G randpa’s all right—
if they did anything to him.
P le a s e !”
Clint hesitated. “ I ’ ll come in with
you,” he decided then. He clim bed
o v er the sill, and with their hands
entwined, they crossed the room.
V ery quietly she rem oved the chair
braced under the knob and opened
the door.
“ H e’s sleeping so peacefully, like
a child.”
When he descended the ladder,
Tope had not reappeared; but Clint
was content in the certainty that
June w as safe. H e stood by the foot
o f the ladder, tense, ready for any
a larm ; and minutes drifted by.
Once there was a sound, toward
the Taine house, a rumbling sound
as though a garage-door had been
rolled back on its track. I f Asa
w ere departing for town now, then
Rab, or Uncle Justus, or Aunt E vie,
m ight presently com e this way.
Clint was in a sw eat of tense, fearful
anticipation. H e began to wonder
why Asa did not start the car
and go.

U S E T H E M O D E R N
IN S E C T K ILLE R
People on North Carolina’s Banks
T alk in Lingo of Queen Elizabeth
Inlanders who visit N orth C arolin
a’s prim itive and rom antic Outer
Banks m eet m any strange sights
and sounds, not the least o f which
is the native dialect spoken by the
“ bankers” who inhabit the narrow
rope of land stretching thread-like
from N orfolk, Va., to Wilm ington,
N. C.
Th e dialect is a strange m ixture
of native dialect and Elizabethan
English, spoken on Roanoke island,
O cracoke and other sm all fishing v illages
along the banks, and outsiders
who som etim es stumble into the
midst of this isolated colony are
likely to be am azed by the language.
I f the outlander asks a native for
information about the fishing thereabouts,
he m ay be told that “ a foine
toim e to go fishing is at hoigh
toide.”
B ecause m any other w ords and
phrases are so sim ilar in texture
and construction to the phraseology
o f Queen E lizabeth’s day, historians
and philologists b elieve there is a
distinct although unexplained connection
between the two.
Som e contend ea rliest settlers
brought their native English speech
to the Carolina shores during the
days o f Queen Elizabeth, and that
this has been preserved through
generation after generation of natives
who live on the “ banks,” seldom
if ev er getting ve ry far aw ay
from their native hearth.
A t Rodanthe they still sing the old
English songs and ballads that w ere
popular in the days of Ben Jonson
and Shakespeare. The ghosts of
Spencer and Chaucer, of Beowuff
and Piers the Plow m an are conjured
up when one hears an able
and affable man spoken of as “ being
witted and couthe.”
A plump, good-looking girl is a
“ throddy m ay .” The old word
“ fleech” means to coax or flatter,
and when a man fails to keep an
engagem ent or do his part, he has
“ scooped” you.
When he dies he has “ gone to leew
a rd ,” and if he goes to "th e countr
y ” he is visitin g the mainland
across the bay.
Persons visiting the “ banks” are
told of the “ ghosties” where the old
wrecks lie scattered along the shore,
o f hens that have “ nesties,” or men
who are “ fitten” fo r certain services
because their "m o th e r w it” makes
them “ m indable.” A flask of whisky
w ill contain not a pint but a
“ point,” and the vine from which
wine is m ade is the “ w ine” and not
the “ vin e.”

more than the state pays.
U. W . Courses for Vets
Wisconsin war veterans will continue
to receive university of Wisconsin
extension courses without cost.
Governor Heil has approved legislative
action which continues this appropriation
for the coming biennium.
The legislature also provided that
text books used in the veteran’s
courses be provided free. Another
change in the reenactment of the law
liberalizes the definition of veteran to
include any state veteran who has
served in the world war and any out
o f state veteran who has resided in
the state five years up to the time of
application.
Since 1937 the extension division
has received 597 registrations from
veterans. Applications for courses
are made on forms furnished by the
state department o f public instruction
and only one course may be taken at
one time.
'ontributed Hu Spud'
on Summer Guests:
The summer trek is on
The cars stop at our door
And disgorge guests
One— two— three— four—
And sometimes more.
They come for just a meal:
To pass a night; to stay a day;
T o spend a week. I t ’s all okay.
I only wish they’d say
When they’ll be here— but nay!
They fe a r I’ll fuss and stew
And cook a meal in all this heat!
Still— they expect to eat.
I f they roll in at noon. I ’d rather
have enough
Upon my board than have to rush
Potatoes in the pot and pa to
butcher shop for extra meat!
I f on a Saturday night
Just when we’re turning in.
Our ears are deafened by the din
O f honking horn;
And turning on the light
T is an unwelcome sight
To find that unexpected friends
Our porch adorn.
Th ere’s barely time to reach the
stores to buy
Bread, butter, moat, and fruit
(T h e grocery bill’s sky h igh !)
Before they close.
The unexpected guests never know
How much more pleasant it had
been
I f they had written they would come
and when.
But worse than these by far
The Sunday visitors are.
No chance to get an extra loaf of
bread
Or buy 2 pounds of hamburger
Instead o f the wee steak or roast
the fam ily would have had.
No chance to bake a cake or pie
And have the sort o f meal they
would enjoy and I.
I love to see my friends
I ’m glad if they can stay.
But how I wish they’d share their
plans
And tell me when they’ll come
And when they’ll go away.
The summer trek is on.
The cars stop at our door
And disgorge guests
One— two— three— four—
And sometimes more.

According to Mr. R. Bruce Nelson,
well-known resident of Fond du Lac,
Wis.. his distressing attacks o f gns
■ind bloat, due to sluggish stomach,
were relieved by W illiam s Formula.
He is so grateful for this relief that
he wants to tell others about this remarkable
medicine which so many
people are praising.
He says he can eat many foods
now and is grateful fo r the opportunity
to endorse such a fine medicine as
Williams Formula.
Williams Formula is a pure, powerful
medicine containing valuable
herbs and other ingredients which
start to work in a fe w minutes to
help relieve burning acid stomach
pains. It stimulates muscle action in
the intestines, and acts as a tonic laxative
to relieve sick headaches or that
loggy feeling and dizziness caused by
constipation. A inild diuretic on the
kidneys. Helps build up the quality
o f iron-poor blood. Get a bottle of
Williams Formula T O D A Y at Maack’
Drug Store. A $1.50 bottle o f thi:;
powerful concentrated, taken in water,
makes a F U L L G A L L O N o f medicine,
therefore, it is economical to take.

on Sum m er G u ests:
The summer trek is on
The cars stop at our door
And disgorge guests
One— two— three— four—
And sometimes more.
They come fo r just a meal:
To pass a night; to stay a day;
To spend a week. I t ’s all okay.
I only wish th e y’d say
W hen they’ll be here— but nay!
They fear I ’ll fuss and stew
And cook a meal in all this heat!
Still— they expect to eat.
I f they roll in at noon, I ’d rather,
have enough
Upon my board than have to rush
Pota to es in the pot and pa toj
butcher shop for extra meat!
I f on a Saturday night
Just when we’re turning in.
Our ears are deafened by the din
O f honking horn;
And turning on the light
T is an unwelcome sight
To find that unexpected friends
Our porch adorn.
There’s barely time to reach the
stores to buy
Bread, butter, meat, and fruit
(Th e grocery bill’s sky h igh !)
Before they close.
The unexpected guests never know
How much more pleasant it had
been
I f they had written they would come
and when
But worse than these by fa r
The Sunday visitors are.
No chance to get an extra loaf of
bread
Or buy 2 pounds o f hamburger
Instead o f the wee steak or roast
the fam ily would have had.
No chance to bake a cake or pie
And have the sort of meal they
would enjoy and I.
I love to see my friends
I ’m glad if they can stay.
But how I wish they’d share their
plans
And tell me when they’ll come
And when they’ll go away.
The summer trek is on.
The cars stop at our door
And disgorge guests
O n e— two— th r ee— f o u r—
And sometimes more.

I f you have loads o f money . . . i f you can afford
to buy twice as many gallons . . . if you
can pay the cost o f burning or scraping off the
old paint every two years or so- and the

you are rich enough to use a “ cheap,” low

But if you want to make every dollar count
— to get value for your money— then you’d
better buy the best house paint money can

Come in and let us tell you the truth about

M U R R A Y
D H I L I P is six years old and attend*
the university elem entary
school a m ile and a half from his
home. H e goes on the streetcar,
transferring at the downtown station.
It was during the first cold snap in
N ovem ber that he arrived at school
one m orning and found the door
locked. Bobbie, whose m other had
just let him out of her auto at the
corner and driven home, was in
the sam e plight. A neighbor had
prom ised to phone the mothers of
these two boys that there would be
no school but had forgotten to do so.
“ Say, Bobbie, we can just go back
on the streetcar. See, I have m y
nickel,” said Philip.
“ But I haven’ t any nickel,’ * replied
Bobbie. “ Mam a alw ays comes
fo r m e.”
“ Oh, m aybe we can phone h er,”
suggested Philip. “ M y m other won’ t
be home fo r she takes Brother to
the kindergarten and goes to her
classes. L e t’s go in the schoolhouse.
T h ere’ s a phone in the office, I
know.”
“ But the door’ s locked,” said Bobbie,
tears gathering in his eyes.
“ Yes, it's locked,” said Ph ilip as
he turned from fum bling with the
handle. “ Oo-oo! I t ’s c o ld !” The boy,
with only a light overcoat for protection,
sh ivered in his socks and
short trousers. "B o b b ie,” he said,
“ I don’ t know the w ay home, do
\ you**”
“ No. I n ever went home alone,”
and Bobbie began to cry.
Although Ph ilip knew Bobbie only
as he had seen him in class, it n ever
occurred to him to use his own
nickel and go home, leavin g Bobbie
alone.
"O h , stop cry in g .” said Philip, on
the v e rg e o f tears himself. “ I don’ t
know w hat to do—but we have to
do something. Kid. or w e’ ll freeze,
j S a y ! w hy can’t w e follow the street-
I ca r track? The car that alw ays
takes m e has to go on that track.
I know w here your house is when
I ’m on the ca r.”
H e grabbed Bobbie’s hand and
they began their long trudge back
on the sidewalk beside the rails,
down through the town w here Ph ilip
a lw ays transferred and then along
by the other car line. Th ey w ere
v e r y cold and the biting northwest
wind hindered their progress.
Teach Self-Reliance.
“ Oh, what are the boys doing
h e re ? ” exclaim ed Bobbie’s m other
as the boys appeared.
“ T h e door w as locked. Th ere
w asn’ t any school,” cried Bobbie.
“ But how did you ev e r find your
w a y hom e?”
“ Why, w e just follow ed the tracks
’cause that’ s the w ay the cars go,”
said Ph ilip in a m atter-of-fact tone.
Our M other’s club has been much
interested in Philip— his independence,
grit, self-assurance, frankness
and m ature reasoning.
“ H a ve you educated Ph ilip with
the idea of m aking him self-reliant’
” we asked his mother.
“ N o, I think that w as done in kind
erga rten ,” she answered, sm iling,
“ but his teacher fe lt that his father
and I had helped him by avoiding
the developm ent of fear. When
learning to walk, he som etim es fell.
Then w e would speak casually of
the cause, the rum pled rug, for instance,
diverting him from his discom
fort. We often sent him into
dark rooms to get things, assuming
as a m atter of course he’d go. He
has never feared the dark. As a
toddler, I let him w alk alone outof-
doors as far as it was safe. When
we went on the street I g a v e him
the idea of protecting m e from the
automobiles. Although v e ry solicitous
about m y sa fety, he had no
fe a r .”
“ T e ll us how you deal with him
when naughty,” w e asked, fo r our
club has a feeling that it takes grea t
wisdom to retain a proper authority
o v er the bright child and still allow
him enough freedom to insure selfreliance.
“ I deprive him o f p riv ileg es occasionally,
if the connection is cle a rly
eviden t,” his m other replied. “ L e c turing
or demanding accomplishes
nothing. I ’m not a lw ays wise, but
he trusts m e and doesn’ t d eceive
me. When his father or I appeal to
his reason and treat him w'ith the
courtesy accorded a grown person,
he alm ost a lw ays responds instantly.”

ADVENTURERS’ CLUB
H E A D L I N E S F R O M T HE L I V E S
O F P E O P L E L I K E Y Q U t S E L F I
“ Adventure in a Pickle Factory”
He l l o , e v e r y b o d y :
W ell sir, h ere’ s a yarn that's going to sound a sour note in
our adventure saga. When I read it I thought of that old song,
“ Down by the W inegar W oiks,” and I ’d be w illing to bet that
place was right next door to the one w here John Mains, of Lon g
Island, had his life ’ s big adventure. You.see, the concern John
works for is one of those outfits that catch ju ven ile cucumbers
before they get a chance to grow up, soak them in vin egar and
send them out into the world to decorate ham and cheese sandwiches.
John has a job in a pickle factory.
The factory is in East N orthport—John's home town— and I’ m
w illing to adm it th ey 've turned out some pretty good pickles
there. But if they keep on making pickles until pickles stop havj
ing warts, th ey’ ll never turn out a tougher one than the pickle
; John got in, just from tryin g to keep the m achinery going and
the pickles m oving out in a steady, uninterrupted acidulous
stream .
John is a machinist at that E ast Northport pickle foundry,
and it was on January 18, 1935, that he ran into Old L ad y A d venture.
The m achinery in the factory is run by a big 50-foot
shaft suspended just below the ceiling. Belts running from this shaft
furnish the power to the various m achines, and on this day one o f the
belts had broken.
John was ordered to replace that broken belt, and he went

from slipping is to w ax it. So John got a can of w ax and started
up the ladder toward the shaft. But this tim e he neglected to
shut off the power.

Onlv One Billion?
The rem ark. " T h is is a billiondollar
country,” w as m ade by
Speaker Thomas B. R eed o f Maine
in answer to a com plaint of a m em ber
regarding a billion-dollar appropriation
The incident occurred
in the second session o f the F ifty -
first congress in 1891. In the first
session WOO.000,000 had been appropriated
and a slightly la rger amount
in the second session, m aking a total
appropriation for that congress
of something o ver a billion.
H e was d ated— bew ildered— gasping— when suddenly
his clothes started to rip.
the top o f the ladder and went to work. But he had hardly started
when he lost his balance. And the ladder went sliding out from under
him !
Instinctively, John threw his body to one side— and he landed
right up against the w hirling shaft. Th e ladder went tumbling
to the floor, but John didn’t follow . In the fe w seconds w hile he
was jam m ed up against that shaft it had caught his clothing—
began twisting it around and around!
In two turns the shaft had taken up all the slack in those duds of
John's. Then it began putting on the pressure. John fe lt his body being
squeezed until he thought his ribs would break. His chest w as flattened
until he couldn't breathe. He was ham m ered and pounded against
the ceilin g until he w as bruised and covered with blood. And still that
shaft twisted, and still it tightened the clothing around his body. Th ere
was no one in the room at the time, and John couldn't get enough
breath in his lungs to call for help. F or a minute he thought he was
going to die there, alone, 15 feet from the floor and dangling in m id air.
H e w as dazed— bew ildered— gasping—when suddenly his clothes started
to rip.
A gain the shaft began turning, taking up the slack. It tore every
stitch o f clothing from his back and arm , and didn't stop until it reached
his w rist. Th ere the m achinery began tw isting the end of his s le e v e -
tw isting it so tightly that John thought sure it w as going to take his
hand off.H is chest was fre e now of that terrib le tension. H e could
breathe— he could even have called for help. But by that tim e
John was too fa r gone to cry out. He hung dangling from the
shaft, the blood stream ing down his body—conscious enough to
know what was happening to him . but not conscious enough to
do anything about it.
It was a thought that finally saved the day. A ll of a sudden
John thought of his w ife and child. IVhat would they say when
they learned what had happened to him. How would they get
along when John couldn't bring home the w eekly pay envelope
any m ore? “ That thought roused m e.” John says. “ And then I
must have let out a scream . I don't rem em b er cryin g out, hut
m y brother, who also worked at the fa ctory, and who w as in the
next room, heard a yell and cam e running in to see what
was the m atter.”
A fter Last Scream , John Loses Consciousness.
John’ s brother didn’t com e a minute too soon, either. F or a fter that
last thought and that last scream he had lost consciousness. His brother
ran and shut ofT the pow er and then ran back and picked up the fallen
ladder. He clim bed to the top, cut John loose with a pocket knife,
and ca rried him down that ladder on his back.
John’s brother rounded up a couple o f other fellow s in the factory
and they took John to a doctor. John w as there quite a w hile before
he cam e to again. When the doctor heard w hat had happened he just
sim ply couldn’t see how John had m anaged to liv e through his experience.
And that's a thing John doesn't quite understand either. “ I
thought that I'd at least lose m y a rm ,” he says, “ but the doctor
fixed it up and now it’s in good shape again. When it was all over
I thought I was the luckiest man on earth. And I S T IL L think so.”
T h e y 're still m aking pickles out in that fa cto ry at East Northport.
But it w ill be many a long day before they produce another one like
that one John got into. A t least, I hope it will.

N E W Y O R K — In an em ergen cy.
Am erican fa rm ers m ay grow the
country’s soft coal in their fields.
Th e fa ct that fa irly good soft coal
is now being m ade from sugars, the
carbohydrates of farm crops, was
reported to the A m erican Institute
of Mining and M etallu rgical Engineers
by E. Berl, of the C arnegie
Institute of Technology.
The sugar coal is too expensive to
be practical, but was m ade to settle
an old controversy about the origin
of coal and oil.
In the C arnegie laboratories,
whose experts include some of the
leading scientists of the coal fields,
the artificial coal is m ade in two
ways. Sugar heated in w ater at
high tem perature produces a sandy
form of coal.

N ew Process Produces Soft Coal From Sujiar Cane
When weak alkali is added to the
w ater, Berl said, “ excellent coking
coals” are the result. Adding pressure
to the hot sugar water increases
the amount o f carbon in the
man-made coal.
These farm -product coals, Berl
said, can be treated writh hydrogen
to m ake the sam e products which
the G erm ans and English obtain
from “ hydrogen ated " coal. These
products include gasoline and oil for
m otor cars.
The old idea, said B erl, that coal
cam e from the w oody, or lignin,
part o f plants is as dead as the idea
that petroleum is from dead fish.

ON E of the points that was
ta u g h t us as m e d ic a l
students was the use of exercise
in weak or failing hearts.
Today the first
thought in treati
n g a n a c u t e
heart ailm ent —
a n g i n a , c o r o n
a r y th r o m b o sis,
high blood pressure — is
absolute rest in order to
g ive the heart a c h a n c e t o regain
some o f its s t r e n g t h or
“ reserve .” And because rest is the j
proper treatm ent at this tim e, pa- j
tients, and som etim es physicians, ,
are likely to indulge in or prescribe {
rest when what the heart really
needs to gain new strength is ex ercise.
A popular treatm ent in form er
years was what was known as the
Nauheim baths and the Schott
m ethod of "resist*
iv e ” exercise in
r ^ which the patient
I 1 exercises his mus-
P I cles against the resistance
of the phy-
^ I sician’s or attend-
I ant s hands.
1 In speaking of ex-
M ercise in the treatment
of chronic (not
recen t) heart or
“ blood vessel disease,
Dr. Barton Dr. Louis F au geres
Bishop Jr., N ew
Y ork, in A rch ives of Physical Th erapy,
X-ray, Radium , states that
w'ith bed patients, massage, breathing
exercises, and “ resistive” ex ercises
are beneficial in that they help
to fo rce the used blood in the veins
back to the heart.
G radual E xercise Increase.
W hat is known as the O ertel m ethod
of exercise consists of graded
walks carried out until the patient
begins to feel the effects of the ex ercise
by ve ry rapid breathing. B eginning
on the level, the walks are
increased gradually with regard to
distance and incline or steepness.
F or less severe cases, where the
patient is up and about m ost of the
tim e. Dr. Bishop suggests that as it
is difficult to know exactly how
much exercise the patient can take
safely, he should be allowed to tell
how his everyd a y m anner of life
affects him.
The stair test or exercise has been
much used. Som e heart patients
liv e entirely on the ground floor, but
Dr. Bishop points out that if they
clim bed the stairs one step at a
tim e, it m ight becom e a heart
strengthening and safe exercise.
The thought then is that a fter the
heart has been rested in bed and by
sitting around for some tim e, some
fo rm of exercise, as directed by the
physician, strengthens the heart
m uscle and prevents patient from
becom ing an invalid.

During the flu epidem ic a consulting
physician exam inating the chart
o f a young m edical officer, sick with
pneumonia (fo llow in g the flu) shook j
his head as he pointed to the num- j
ber of white corpuscles (the disease 1
fighters) present in the blood. As
the patient w as v e ry ill it was to be
expected that the number o f these j
white corpuscles would grea tly in- ,
crease from the norm al num ber of
6.000 to 8,000 per cubic m illim eter
to perhaps 20.000 or 30.000. whereas
there was only about 7,000.
The explanation of the consultant’s
feeling that there w as no hope
is that while a rise to 30,000 or
40.000 would show that the illness
was ve ry serious, it would show also
that the resisting ability o f the body
w as ve ry g rea t in being able to j
provide this la rge number o f white I
corpuscles.
Sim ilarly, when there is rapid but |
strong pulse, increased blood pres- |
sure, and a rise in tem perature, it
is direct evidence that there is in- j
fection or other trouble in the body, ;
but just as d irect evidence that the |
body is putting up a fight against
the infection or other trouble.
How Body Fights Disease.
Thus Dr. F. M. Pottenger in En- j
docrinology (science o f the ductless
glands— thyroid, pituitary, and oth- I
ers ) states: “ It would seem to me
that the conception or idea that the i
combination o f sym ptom s— pain, in- j
creased heart rate, increased blood 1
pressure, increased number o f white I
blood corpuscles, rise in body temperature—
which w e call disease j
represents really the condition |
which the b o d y must assume in order
to protect itself against the
disease elem ents which are causing
trouble in the b o d y, is m ost reasonable.
With this idea—that the s y m p toms
really show that the b ody is
fighting the disease— w e can recog nize
inflam m ation and other reactions
in the body to toxic or
poison products as really a
tective’ process.”
You can readily understand then
why your physician is m ore concerned
about the strength of the
heart and the general condition of
the body than he is about the tem perature
being high or the blood
pressure increased.

f The new wool w eaves are adding
; a particularly exciting chapter to
I the current story of fabric elegance,
j In laying the foundation for the ear-
I ly fa ll wardrobe the idea of hand-
| some wool styled to a nicety with
I emphasis on dram atic sim plicity, is
m aking widespread appeal.
What to offset the amazing sim plicity
of the dress or suit of swank
w ool? The answer is gold jew elry accents.
Which is one of the startling
item s of news in tne new season's
trends. Th ere is a “ gold rush” on
in fashion’ s realm . Black with gold
is especially a m essage that is being
flashed throughout the style centers
o f the world.
Black wool jersey, a particularly
sm art indication for early fall, is
j used for the fashion-right semi-
| tailored dress centered to right
above in the illustration. Note, with
the bracelet-length sleeves the unusually
w ide gold bracelet. This
1 m atter of the w id er bracelet is in

lly demands a necklace and a
suitable one as here shown is of
gold links with gold knobs. The
wide link gold bracelet looks w ell
with the necklace and a cunning
gold clip clim axes this jew elry ensemble.
The plaid hat crowns the
j entire with glory.
Gold jew elry as a smart accent
' to colorful tweeds has also becom e i
i a hobby w'ith fashion. To the left ;
in the picture see a deep bright
green tweed suit with a new collar
treatm ent and stitched detail down
the front of the jacket. The skirt
is w idely gored. Take particular
notice of the gold and green tourmaline
daisy pin w'ith a diamond
center worn on the jacket. The
bracelets are of the new large gold
link type. Gold stitched suede describes
the hat.
A few notes in general in regard
to the new wool w eaves follow. The
trend to smoother versions of the
velvety duvetyn order is apparent.
Th ere are also m any ribboned woolens.
While black w’oolens are having
a widespread initial call, there
is also a big m ovem ent going on
among richly colorful tweeds and
other wool w eaves gorgeously toned
in new shades of blue green and
flower reds with rust tones greatly
in fa vo r fo r sports and travel wear.

It s going to be a banner season
for sweaters. F rom the practical
angle the skirt-and-sweater idea has
no peer. Essential to the joy of a
junior or teen age is the skirt that is
muchly gored as is the one worn by
the little girl in the picture. There
‘ pro- 1 j, something very fashion-wise about
this model. Sewn seam detail alteri
nates with pressed crease to create
| added interest in the styling of this
skirt which is fashioned of naphtha-
| lated wool gabardine. The soft angora
sweater assem bled with it may
be in contrasting shade or matching
shade o f the skirt. Either w ay you
w ill be right in style.
S e a s o n o f L u x u r y
I n F a b r i e s S e e n
A ll signs point to a season of
luxury especially in m atter of fabric
elegance. The tendency is toward
dignified trends rather than the
much-exploited “ little g ir l” fashions
that have been centering the stage
during past months.
Suits of stiff fa ille, rich brocades
for evening w ear, imposing jew elry
accents em phasizing wide bracelets,
necklaces that have a broad
collarlike spread and m assive gold
effects in belts, and in clips all indicate
return to elegance.
T h e p lay being m ade on fur borderings

know— it’s just buttonhole stitch
(th e r e ’s just a touch of other

are stunning on natural linen
or soft pastel shades with stitchery
in w hite or the m atching color.

pattern o f 16 m otifs ranging from
31/4 by ZVa inches to 4’/2 by 15
