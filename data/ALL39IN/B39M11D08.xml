High school band
By request of the V FW organization
we publish the following article
from the Service magazine 
 The annual observance of Armistice
Day is a sacred responsibility for
every American citizen This is the
day we have set aside for special remembrance
o f those who gave their
lives during the World War This
day is also the occasion on which we
pay special tribute to those thousands
of our World W ar soldiers sailors I
and marines who occupy our veteran
hospitals throughout the land those
men whose minds and bodies are still
paying one of the most frightful costs
 of war 
 On this anniversary it is only fitting
and proper that every citizen
should dedicate himself and his efforts 
to the proposition that the
Armistice of 1918 must be the foundation
for a real and lasting peace
for the people of this nation It is
our responsibility to make certain the
World W ar which culminated in that
Armistice 21 years ago shall be the
last World W ar in which the United
States of America shall be forced to
take part 
 The price of peace like the price
of liberty is eternal vigilance Despite
our democratic form of government 
the enlightenment of our people 
and the natural resources which
make us one o f the richest nations
on earth we are constantly confronted
with the knowledge that war destroys
those blessings once we permit
it to break loose in our midst This
is why we must concentrate all our
energies all our efforts and all our
intelligence upon the achievement of
a state in which war will never be
necessary for the maintenance and
security of our people 
 It is logical to believe that men
who know a front line trench is a
rendezvous with death from which
few escape have made a deeper study
o f the causes o f war than the average
non veteran The members of
the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the
United States sincerely believe they
are qualified to plan and promote a
program that will strive to keep America
out of war Based on their
personal experiences and fired by the
patriotic ideals they have already demonstrated 
these men have formulated
a practical program of security
for this country and its people

Krohn of this city had made

of last year when she returned
from California where she had been
for 30 years They both spent part
o f the time in Chicago last winter
with their daughter and niece Mrs 
E A Gebhardt Their association

many happy memories

W inona Robert Kjelland of St 
P aul and Drs Erwin and Robert
Krohn o f this city Mrs Erwin
Krohn and Mrs Robert Krohn were
in charge of the flowers Interment
services were held at the family lot
in Rushford Minnesota 
Miss Kjelland was born in Rushford 
Minnesota in 1874 In 1892
she was graduated from Teachers 
College in Winona In 1896 she was
graduated from Pratt A rt Institute of
Brooklyn New Yorks and she received
her B A degree from the U niversity
of Southern California in
1936 She was a member of the
honor society of Phi Kappa Phi She
had taught art for 42 years the past
30 of which had been at the Polytechnic
high school at Los Angeles 
California She reached the California
retirement age in 1939 
Little was known by her friends
here of the excellence o f her work
but an idea may be gained of it
from an editorial in The Optimist 
school magazine It follows 
 We lift our hats to the students
producing the tops in art work! Miss
Thea Kjelland in her remote corner
of the Parrot institution directs a
hard working crew of pupils who
combine their talents to illustrate the
various publications of Polytechnic 
 The Optimist which received Pacemaker
award a few months ago credits
many o f its points to the fine work
of these art classes 
 In Polytechnic Annuals their
work is recorded in drawings and designs 
in cartoons and illustrations 
Every Poly High contains examples
of their work 
 The linoleum cuts Miss Kjelland s
staff produces round out many feature
stories o f The Optimist and add
the right touch for every holiday edition 
The covers o f many programs
are decorated by linoleum blocks so
skillfully cut they would pass as wood
engravings well executed 
 Especially noteworthy is the project
conducted for many years by this
class of supplying cards designed and
colored by the art students These
are sold for the Scholarship Society
welfare fund 
 So to Miss Kjelland and to the
rising young artists she trains we
raise our hats They make a great
contribution to the success of all
Polytechnic publications 
Miss Kjelland is deeply mourned by
three sisters Mrs Krohn of this
city Mrs O Hanson of Rushford

By Earl Horswill
November has been designated as
Peace Month by the Co operatives of
the United States and other countries
and special emphasis is to be placed
on the 11th This movement for international
peace was started several
years ago by the Co operative Women s
Guild in England The spirit
of the movement was taken up by the
Women s Guilds of Co operatives
throughout the United States and
this fall when the directors of the
Co operative League and National Cooperatives
met at Chicago the position
of the Co operative movement in
relation to the question of peace was
one of the primary subjects considered 
as practically all wars fought
in the past world s history has been
caused from economic reasons Mr 
E B Bowen general secretary of the
Co operative League of the U S A 
addressing the meeting declared 
 America s greatcontribution to peace
will be to develop economic organizations
which will produce and distribute
plenty to all the people By
building co operatives in our home
communities we will build the economic
foundation of world peace 
It might seem that little if anything
that a few thousand peace loving
co operators of America can do
to halt the rising conflagration in
Europe But co operation goes much
deeper and looks much farther than
one crisis one economic depression 
one war It looks to the gradual but
sure elimination of motives and methods
which prepare the breedingground
for depressions and wars The
following is an extract from the Commonwealth 
national magazine of
Catholic opinion The way co operative
leaders in the United States are
going at the war problem is a challenge
to American religious bodies 
These men strongly imbued with the
ideal a Christian one of the brotherhood
of man declare that co operators
should refuse to fight other cooperators 
And there are 70 000 000
of them enrolled in 120 000 co operative
societies in 38 countries This
form of internationalism does not
seem far enough developed yet but
it is building soundly for the future 
A special peace issue of Consumers
Co operation just off the press says
straight out that the present war is
a conflict between economic greed
and economic greed between force
and force between fear and fear 
As the co operators of this and
other nations are dedicating themselves
to work for peace futile as it
may seem in the face of this present
war nevertheless let us the co operators
of Jackson county do likewise
by thinking talking and acting m
terms of peace not only during this
month but hereafter and do all we
can to restore and preserve Peace on
Earth Good Will Toward Men

On a certain day last week having
been made the target several

and found the ammunition used was

Every one is interested in happenings
concerning former students of
Black River Falls High The Oriole
has decided to devote a column for
this purpose The title was suggested
by a recent graduate who heartily endorsed
the idea The regular appearance
of such a column depends entirely
on the cooperation and help of
alumni So take notic eall your lums!
The next time you hear a bit of news
concerning a former classmate send it
to the Oriole and let s keep this idea
going 
Requests for subscriptions to the
Oriole are coming in at a rapid pace
and one letter from a former student
now at the University of Wisconsin 
brings the following testimonial 
which we quote After a hard day
at school I look forward to reading
about D N s sleepiness in the Oriole 
It gives we the let down I need
and I don t feel so bad about sleeping
in class (after all I don t snore) 
At night one glance at the honor roll
sends me to bed with higher ideals for
the next day in vain (how did that
get in ) Anywhoo (carry over from
Hallowe en) the Oriole s O K under
K O and the rest of the bunch I m
sure it will continue its progress under
the new staff too 
A request for a subscription from
Mrs Loren Gilbert formerly Miss Logan 
a member of our faculty She s
considered an alumnus too in fact we
think of her as a 38 grad too as
that s when she decided to leave here
and take up a new job 
The first newsy item comes from
an alum now at the university who
states that Rosli Zwahlen ( 39) is
 toeing the mark in at least one study
as she takes the free dancing lessons
provided twice weekly by the
Wisconsin Union 
Aleen Trask who attends Stephen
College Columbia Missouri is a member
of the Sunrise choir There are
only 16 girls from the entire student
body who are chosen for the local
group It is indeed a great honor for
Aleen who was one of our last years
graduates

Perhaps many of you thing the
ideal student should be tall dark and
handsome but this is not true The
ideal student may be as small as he
likes can have the worst colored hair
in school and his face may be plastered 
with freckles 
The ideal student should have
marks of at least 85 I do not say
that he should have the highest
marks but he should try for the very
best marks he can get 
The ideal student should know the
rules and regulations of the school 
He should follow them at all times 
For instance we have a rule in Black
River Falls High school that says you
should not take two steps at a time 
When a teacher is around you probably
take your time but when you re
in a hurry and there aren t any teachers
around you race up the stairs 
This is not what is called an ideal
student 
Extra curricular subjects are another
thing To be an ideal student
you should join at least two extra
curricular activities There are many
clubs in our high school and surely
you might find two out of so many 
One student may study all the time
and get excellent marks but if they
do not have some outside recreation
I do not believe that they could be
called the ideal student 
An ideal student must have personality 
however To me the ideal student
should try and have many
friends and should have an even temper 
Last but not least to be an ideal
student you must have school spirit 
You do not have to be on the football
or basket ball team to have school
spirit You can come to the games
and cheer your team to victory If
your team loses don t mumble and say
 we have a poor team this year 
That isn t showing the correct school
spirit and I wouldn t call one of
these people an ideal student 
Let s all try to make our school a
bit more by making ourselves an ideal
student

The Agriculture students are now
starting supervise practice work 
Every boy in Vocational Agriculture
is expected to carry out the practice
problems of the improved nature of
successful farming on their home
farms Each boy should gain ownership
of some phase of the farm
where he will have an opportunity to
practice the material which he gains
from books and bulletins in class
room 
A good example of home farm
practice is herd testing Thirty five
boys are testing and keeping approximate
records of over 200 cows More
will be heard later on this supervise
practice program inasmuch as this is
one of the major enterprises of the
vocational Agriculture project 
They plan to start a Future Farmer
organization in the near future 
More will be heard about these after
it is started

Gee you kids have been good the
last couple of weeks I can t seem
to dig up a dog goned thing against
any of you Of course the senior
dance had its points I guess everybody
was surprised to see a certain
boy and girl leading the grand march 
It was none other than Leslie and
Rose my what won t we see next!
But that isn t all about this new romance 
the question is where did
they go afterwards and get all that
awful red clay on the car tires that
is terrible! Well I ll lay off poor Les
and Rose for a while but I ll be back!
I see Jerry N came to the senior
dance after all What changed your
mind so quick Jerry 
The Hall of Horrors was really
too much for some of the girls especially
for Violet Stanley who nearly
fainted and the Witch (Sparks) and
Frankenstein (Tom H ) were really
the tops 
Some of the teachers haven t grown
up yet After the dance had started a
senior boy went out in the hall and
heard a peculiar noise and it was ( )
one of the teachers jumping up and
down on the bed springs I might
say a er an English teacher Gosh!
Congratulations to the boy in the
dance orchestra and Mr Jorgensen 
AMERICA S
UNBROKEN
ARMISTICE
The armistice of November 11 1918 has
endured for the United States for twentyone
years and it is the hope of every
American that it shall remain unbroken 
This nation has no quarrel with any
other nation We have no entangling
alliances Nor are there in the world
anywhere any baubles of power or conquest
that we are tempted to buy with
precious blood 
We give thanks for the armistice of
1918 and a thousand thanks more for
th a u n b ro k e n a rm is tic e of 1939 i

you played swell only some of the
girls don t like the idea of all the
boys having to play all the time and
not dance 
I noticed the dance was too slow
for a certain group of boys and girls 
off they go to Hatfield!
Another case of puppy love and
who should it be but Margy Hagen
and Jim Theile My my these romances!
Where has Jimmie Pugh been
spending his evenings the last couple
of weeks 
Oh yes back to Rose and Les 
where were you Thursday afternoon
Kaye you certainly missed out on
something nothing happened I hope 
Well toot a toe kids the Snooper
is watching you!
P S Some of the boys certainly
had a good time at Merrillan dance
Friday night How about it Slug 
Dave Harland and a half dozen others

Here is a little poem that s in the
minds of many of the students who
are perplexed by Me 
Osborne in his gum chewing schemes 
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep 
I f I should die before I wake
I ll have no 550 word theme to write 
A chorus of screaming! Girls on
chairs and desks Boys trembling
with excitement and shouting Let
me at em Then the sound of a
stern voice then all was silent A
mouse had escaped 
No it wasn t as bad as all that 
altho it could have been This is the
way it really was A small and very
harmless mouse was unfortunately
captured and held prisoner in the
aquarium of the science room Of
course there wasn t any water in it 
 A fine place for me in an aquarium 
said the mouse what do they think
I am a fish A t once his eyes fell

Have you ever tried frying your
bacon and side pork in the oven I ve
found it a very convenient way to
fry meat when cooking in large
amounts Just place the slices close
together on a cookie sheet and use a
moderately hot oven Turn occasionally 
and the result will be a big platter
of evenly browned and tender
strips of meat 
The Cookie Jar would appreciate
some new recipes very much Now
that the summer rush is past and you
have more time to visit your friends 
or experiment in your own kitchen 
please just remember that every recipe
you share with us is appreciated
not only by the readers but by this
writer as well For she alas must

With all the production of our own
country in normal times the importations
of foreign furs possibly largely
of cheaper furs than fox mink or
beaver are about equal to our own
production Canada Norway Sweden 
and Finland are extensive producers
of fox and mink furs of a quality
comparable with those of our northwestern
states Those countries have
found their markets principally in
England France and Germany where
great industries have been established
for the curing of the furs and their
manufacture Now those principal
markets are closed because of the war
and of war conditions Canada produces
more fox and mink furs than
our own states while the Scandinavian
countries and Finland are larger
producers of fox Without possibility
of the European markets taking up
any considerable part of their surplus
production our own fur breeders fear
it will mean the dumping of these
foreign furs upon our domestic markets 
glutting them and forcing down
prices to a level which will be so low
that the fur breeders of our northern
states will be driven out of business 
The fur breeders received little encouragement
that any move can be
made which will stop the inflow of
the foreign product before spring 
The larger farms may weather
through but the smaller fellows particularly
those who are beginners 
and who have not yet established a
reputation for their farms may have
to quit Consumers may temporarily
find garment prices lower another
year but should our industry be closed
down prices in future years will
react accordingly and return to the
levels of the time before our industry
was developed and the London manufacturers
largely monopolized our
markets at high prices and huge
profits The production of furs from
wild animals in our country would be
far too small to supply the modem
markets and their demands 
The administration won its fight to
repeal the embargo provision of the
Neutrality Act by about 61 majority 
and other amendments to the repealing
bill were voted down After a
perfunctory meeting of the conference
committee the Bloom Pittman
bill will go to the White House for
the President s signature The special
session then will be brought to a
close although there will be a sizeable
minority vote to keep Congress
in session

The threat of administration leaders
in both Senate and House to effect
a repeal of the law under which
the reciprocal trade treaties are negotiated
has brought into play a great
amount of propaganda as to the importance
of the opportunity for grabbing
the foreign trade of the European
nations with South American
countries on account of the war 
The proposed treaties with Argentine
and Uruguay are mentioned as particularly
good for increased trade 
providing of course that tariff duties
shall be so reduced as to permit
those countries to ship their great
surpluses of farm products into our
markets It is evident that a storm
will break when Congress meets in
January as the members of all parties
from the middle west are given
an opportunity to put up a fight 
and the eastern exporters are forestalling
by commencing their propaganda
at this time Possibly Secretary
Wallace has stirred up the matter
with his clash with the State Department
on the subject 
Notwithstanding the opposition the
Department of State is preparing a
great financial program for the South
American countries through which it
is hoped to rehabilitate over one
billion dollars of loans to our people
which are in default upon both principal
and interest By re financing
is meant more loans more of our
good money following that which at
present is lost to American investors
unless some way is found to induce
the folks in the Equator continent to
pay up 
That method of refinancing recently
was attempted with Brazil which
is in default to the tune of $327 000 
000 When its foreign minister visited
here last summer profuse promises
were made that with a bit of our
gold as an additional loan Brazil
would not only buy more of our industrial
products but it would be able
to resume interest payments on the
debts and put some value back into
the defaulted bonds The Brazilian
minister had a grand good time here 
He was received with acclaim and escorted
from the railway station to the
White House by a brass band and a
regiment or two of soldiers Our
 good neighbor policy fairly boiled
over as prospects of bigger and better
business with Brazil seemed to
loom up as a partial cure for the depression 
At the end of the festivities he
returned to Rio de Janeiro Then
came the announcement that $50 
000 000 of our gold had been loaned
to Brazil secured by Brazilian currency 
That was only a few months
ago but no move has been made by
that country to start interest payments 
A public committee has been
trying for years to obtain some adjustment
of the South American indebtedness 
largely held by individuals
to whom the bonds were sold when
the nations to the south were booming 
It has not been successful and
the great refinancing program by our
government is being worked out Apparently
South American affairs are
going to loom up pretty largely in the
next few months 
The war abroad is bringing more or
less disturbance to many lines of industry
in our own country Some of
the larger industries undoubtedly will
benefit for the time being because of
demands for goods and materials
from neutral countries as well as
from those engaged in the conflict 
The steel companies for instance are
looking to a possible expansion of
their trade because exports from both
Germany and England will be stopped
until the war is over The exports
of those two countries amounted to
about six million tons annually The
foreign demand of neutral countries
may be lessened but still it may call
for millions of tons The copper and
machinery industries will likewise find
orders pouring in at war time prices 
The war plane and motor vehicle factories
may expect to prosper exceedingly
while the war lasts Chemical
firms surgical appliance factories and
scores more of the lesser concerns
will feel the impetus In a word our
country will be keying its industrial
production to war time demands just
as they did in the World war And
when war stops as it must ultimately 
that will be another situation and
captains of industry and finance even
some of those who stand in line for
immediate if only temporary profits 
are wise enough to foresee what will
happen and are warning against
booms and over expansion 
There are other industries which
may collapse even before the war
does because of changed conditions 
In Washington there have been delegations
of associations of breeders of
fur bearing animals the past couple
of weeks They are endeavoring to
have the Department of State set up
a quota for the importation of foreign
furs to prevent the markets
from becoming so demoralized that
the fur producing farms may be forced
out of business The Department
realizes the force of the arguments
of these delegations acknowledges
that the competition may prove disastrous 
but indicates that it may
not act because it would be contrary
to its trade pacts and would serve
to bring delegations here from other
industries for a like purpose Probably
there will be no remedy afforded
unless Congress can be induced
to act at the opening of the regular
session 
Possibly only a few people realize
the growth and the extent of the fur
farming industry There are people
in many states engaged in it but
Wisconsin Michigan and Minnesota
are the largest producers particularly
of the fashionable fox mink and
beaver furs It has become an industry
with an annual production of
fifty millions of dollars or more 
There are many large fur farms in
Wisconsin some with million dollar
investments which produce millions
worth of furs and give employment
to hundreds of people Still there
are a great number of smaller fur
farms some just developing whose
total output may be even larger than
that of the big farms

The following regarding the selection
of census workers was included
in a press dispatch from Washington
last week There are many interested
in the matter 
Washington (A P ) Selection of
census workers for the federal government
in Wisconsin said Rep Hull
(Prog Wis ) Wednesday apparently
will be made by the Democratic state
central committee or the state s Democratic
national committeman 
In a statement on the selection of
census workers after the procedure
was outlined to him in a letter from
the census bureau Hull said 
 Although the letter does not so
state it indicates neither Republican
nor Progressive congressmen will
have anything to say about employment
of field workers 
 They advised that field positions
will be filled by the bureau from candidates
recommended by Democratic
members of the house and senate 
 The district supervisors so appointed
on the patronage of Wisconsin
have authority to hire all clerks 
stenographers and enumerators in the
districts 
 It is presumed that in Wisconsin
which has no Democrats in congress 
the selection will be made by either
the Democratic state central committee
or national committeeman the
same as other patronage has been distributed
in the past

Herbert Duxbury came over from
Blair this forenoon enjoying the
ride over good roads in the finest
kind of fall weather ever made Herbert
is one of the old timers of the
Trempealeau valley starting from the
day of the entry of the Joseph Duxbury
homestead in what is now the
town of Curran There were wars
and rumors of wars even in those
early days but things were different
in many other ways In that earlier
period Trempealeau valley and its
bluff sides were almost without trees 
along with many other things it was
without But three quarters of a century
is quite a long time and changes
have been many I f Herbert had kept
track of all the miles he has traveled
over Jackson county highways since
his boyhood he probably would have
a mileage greater than that from
Jackson county to the moon A lot
of his traveling was not done at 50
miles per hour however Much of it
was at a rate of far less than half
that per day After all the years 
Herbert enjoys getting about and he
has a host of friends in the two counties
who are always glad to have him
call 
Very recently the governor of
Maine journeyed to Idaho to enter a
contest with the governor of the latter
state as to which could pick up
the most potatoes in a given time 
The governor of Idaho won the contest 
of course because he was picking
on his home grounds Both Maine
and Idaho grow good and sizeable
potatoes and make a bit of noise
over that fact which is all right all
right but we would suggest that the
governors stage their 1940 potato
pick upper contest right here in Jackson
county sort of a middle ground
for both of them Lindberg Bros 
of Hixton can furnish the spuds and
others nearby can help out if need
be We have a sample of Lindberg
Bros potatoes and it weighs exactly
31 ounces Even pussy governors
from east or west ought to make a
fair record picking up potatoes of
which 31 will fill a bushel basket

In loving memory of our beloved
Babe who died Nov 12 1938 
The sun is brightly shining
On a lone and silent grave 
Beneath lies one we dearly loved
But whom we could not save 
Friends may think we have forgotten
When at times they see us smile 
Little do they know the heart aches
That our smile hides all the while 
* Babe you brought us so much sunshine 
Shared our thoughts through darkest
days 
Making earth seem more like heaven
With your many loving ways 
Sadly missed by Walter and Twyla
