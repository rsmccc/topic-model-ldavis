    TO ENJOY NOVELTY CAMPING TRIP On Friday of this week. Troop 72. »ne hundred
    per cent strong, if the present plans are any indication. is going to try

    The Scouts aie going to b o ! blind-folded when they leave Tomah. and the
    blimls will not be taken off until the Scouts are in entirely Strange
    country. By j strange is not meant, just a few miles out of town on some
    road that a bov n^ght recognize, but to ail good appeal anees, none of the
    Scouts will know where t hejare when released to open eyes This will add to
    the interest, oi what would othei WLse be a dandy trip, for boys are alw ays
    eager to get out into the open for a night s camping. Each Scout w as given
    a su g gested menu, and a list of things to take along that will be needed,
    j This list included at least three i blankets, canteen for w ater, butter,
    loaf plus of bread, skillet can-opener, 10 01 12 boiled pota- ! toes, alt

    The last few miles of the trip will be with the Scouts at>le to look at the

    season, and its opportunities! to spend moie time in recreation. I it has
    been suggested that a pm- i gram »f Attention to the welfare i of
    underprivileged children be! considered by c ar owners in the comm unity
    This plan suggests! th at car owners devote an occa- j ional couple of hours
    to taking j these youngsters o - t into the I country, where they may play
    in i the sunshine, pick wild flow ers.. splash in the w ater of a clean »
    stream or lake, or enjoy such oth-j er diversions as may be available. A
    group of several youngsters may be taken in one car ano there j ate any num
    ber of pleasant spots which may be visited; tw o fine wayside parks within a
    few m inute » driving distance, delightful valleys among the nearby hills,
    numerous sites along the stream s of this section and many other places
    w'hich invite youngsters to c o n e and play. Each individual t a r owner is
    privileged to select the children whom he might care to entertain on one of
    these proposed trips and also siect the location and program to be followed.
    The main point is to get the>e little fellows out for a tim e where they m
    ay enjoy themselves. There are a large number of children in the city who
    are left to shift for themselves and they may be given a new enjoym ent of
    life if thoughtful car owmei-s will give, them an occasional t yp into th-
    country It is a sm S i thing Ui do and th‘ results will be far in excess of
    the effort. Select yoilr group now and arrange for a trip into the country S
    aturday 01 Sunday afternoon: o ther »lays may be more convenient later, when
    the schools are out. but now’ is a good tim to s ta it with waek end

    consumers, a n d other dairy interests appeared before the assembly comm
    ittee on agriculture last week to register vigorous opposition to the
    Bichler bill which would re-enact the milk price control law on a perm anent
    basis O riginally parsed in 1933, the milk piice contiol law has been
    re-enacted by successive legislatures as emergency legislation. It allows
    the departm ent ot agricultu re and m arkets, in those urban areas where
    producers and distributors agree, to fix prices for fluid milk and cream in
    order to stabilize the m arket ami to p r ivent unfair m arketing practices
    which existed prior to 1933 Opponents of the bill claimed th a t the sta tu
    te merely built a | ~' of “fence around the cities for a fav j committee,
    ored circle of producers.” th at it failed to alleviate the dist% ss of the
    g reat m ajority of dairy Taim e is who are outside the city m arket areas,
    th at it. tended in some cases to accentuate theji troubles by decreasing
    consumption and increasing the flow of cheese factory and condensery surplus
    milk to the cream ery, outlets, and th at it worked a liardship on the
    workmen in the cities w'ho cannot afford to pay the high retail prices for
    the milk which lus family needs for health. Producers and distributors who
    are now protected under the law argued that failure to re-enact it would
    result in a return to the chaotic conditions which existed before 1933. and
    denied the claim that the price-fixing sta tu te has decreased consumption.

    CHRISTIAN M JEN OE CHURCHES • Adam and F allen Man” w ill be th e subject of
    th i Lesson-Serm on read m all C hurches of Christ, Scientist, on Sunday,
    May 7. The Golden T ext is taken from I C orinthians 15:22: “As in Adam ail
    die, even so in C hrist shall all be m ade alive. ‘ The follow ing Citations
    from the Bible are included in the Lesson-Serm on : •The night is far spent,
    the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the w orks of darkness, and
    let us p u t on the arm our of light. For ye w ere som etim es darkness, but
    now are ye light in the Lord; w'alk as children of lig h t’ (Rom ans 13 12;
    Ephesians 5;). The Lesson - Serm on includes the follow ing correlative
    passages from the C hristian Science te x tbook, “Science and H ealth w ith
    Key to the Scriptures,” by M ary Baker Eddy: “For .rig h t reasoning there
    should be but one fact before the thought, nam ely, spiritual existence.
    Science reveals m aterial m an as never the real being. The dream or belief
    goes on, w hether our eyes are closed o r open. God's children already
    created will be cognized only as m an finds the tru th of being” (pp. 492,
    491, 69). I The members of the Wisconsin assembly this week went to work on
    the biggest piece of legislation wrhich will confront them this session, the
    biennial budget bill. A fter weeks of revising and adjustm ent, the finance
    committer has reported out for passage the fourth version of the budget,
    called “Substitute Amendment No. 2.” which calls for an appropriation of
    approxim ately $70,000,000 for the next two years. W ith legislative floor
    leaders conceiting th at a $4,000.000 to S5,- 000,000 relief bill in
    addition to the budget appropriations is likely, predictions th at the Heil
    ad m inistration’s expenditures will reach $75,000,000 seemed likely of
    realization th is week. For purposes of comparison here is the record of
    expenditure j REORGANIZING of other adm inistrations in tho ’ present

    prom inently identified with Progressiv activity foi m any years As party
    leader he succeeds John Reynolds of Green Bay. who resigned a fte r the last
    campaign. REVENUE BILL When the m em bers of the W isconsin senate and
    assembly com plete action on the biennial budget late this month, another bi
    task will be aw aiting them. It will fc - the adm inistration’s revenue
    bill, a m easure which thi.^ year wall present difficulties which lew- other
    legislatures in recent years have faced. M ajority leaders of the
    legislature report th a t the revenue bill is not yet in final shape,
    principally because adm inistration fiscal not yet decided what kind of new
    taxes to recommend to balance the budget. It is unlikely th at the tax bill
    will be introduced until the budget is neai final passage. Govemo Heil’s
    financial assistance and the m em bers of the joint finance com m ittee have
    b e e n studying a variety of possible tax es to meet the deficiency in sta
    te revenues. Most discussed thu.-. fat is a stiff “non-essentials” tax.
    which would fall on s ile s of liquor. tobacco anti cigarettes, cosmetics,
    and other commodities considered by m any persons as luxuries. POLITICAL
    ACTIVITY A fter several m onths of comp arativ e quiet. Witx: si n pol
    itical organizations are ^ to bieak mto the news more frequently. Most prom
    inent currently is th Dem ocratic party, which reached a new» low in voting
    pow er last fall when it polled only about 80,- 000 votes for its sta te
    ticket headed by Senator H arry W. Bolens for governor. Criticizing the
    regular state organization headed by William D. Carroll, p a rty chairman,
    for inac- RepuWican m ajorities in rapid fire fashion last week continued
    their job of reshaping the p attern of the sta te capitol adm inistrative
    departm ents. Their aim is twofold: to repeal many of the departm ents and
    changes made by the form er La Follette adm inistration. and to install
    their own ideas for governm ental organization. Most recent actions of the
    legislature included approval of a new d eportm ent of agriculture and m
    arkets, with a seven member advisory board which will choose a director and
    set up such divisions as are found necessary, and passage of a bill setting
    up a new securities division for the adm inistration of the “blue sk y ’
    laws in the governor’s office. S trictly Honest Judge: So you broke mto the

    proposed in the measure. Probably the pracitcai application of such a
    program would require careful consideration and possibly amendm ents to the
    bill might be necessary. The sam e bill now' before the Senate is also
    befóte the House comm ittee on Agriculture. Ther- it has met w ith the
    sturdy opposition of some of those who prefer the present system oi “farm
    relief” which relates mainly lo cotton, corn, wheat, rice and tobacco. Those
    products form but about hall the total of our farm production, but w ith
    principal a t tention paid to cotton, in which the government now- has an in
    vestment of ovf-r $700 millions, the other four crops hav»‘ a minor share in
    th e aworking out of th»- law- Satisfied to a degree with U". governm ent’s
    liberality tow'ard cotton, those interested in th a t staple are not
    inclined to favor a plan which would include all a g riculture in all p a
    rts of the coun- Consequ'n11 y, the House com mittc e voted as strongly
    against the cost-of-production bill a s the Senate com m ittee did for it.
    By a vote of 17 to 6. the com m ittee voted not to p rmit the measure to
    come before t.h1 House for a vote Now the oniy course open to the friends of
    the m easure is by petition, a rough and difficult course as frequently has
    been the case when House and comm ittee leaders unite to block action. The
    Ludlow war am endm ent and the farm refinancing bill were both ; blocked,
    even though a clear m ajority of the m emebrs .signed the petition in each
    instance. Th»4 dairymen and business men of Wisconsin are unitedly behind
    the movement to have dairy products included as basic commodities under the
    present farm pian, w ith p a rity price fixing as has been done w ith
    cotton, corn, w'heat, etc. The m easure for this dairy parity program is
    being carefully draw-n and is about ready tor presentation, a large
    delegation of F arm Union m em bers and other farm ers ar° in W ashington,
    and they are stro n g ly backed by the aroused interest of the people of
    Wisconsin and Minnesota dairy districts organized by the D airy Business P a
    rity League. They want the same plan for d airy products as the governm ent
    provides for cotton anti other crops They are preparing to urge their
    measure and its m erit upon the comm ittees of Senate and House. Thy demand
    action a t this session, and present conditions in the dairy m arkets
    certainly emphasize the need of th at im m ediate action. The dairy- people
    of the northwest. who have suffered greater loases in the past few years
    than any other line of farm ing, and whose repeated and continued demands
    have hitherto not been complied with, are now in the fight to obtain the
    recognition they so urgently ne'-d. They will j have the vigorous support of
    their congressional representatives, m any of whom have wrorked »long j and
    earnestly to obtain govern- ; ment policies which wouki put dairyland back
    on a firm founds- j tion. VALLEY JUNCTION Mr. Fred Handy Sr. died Tuesday

    planted by the boya j of this departm ent. The variety j of trees planted
    are Norway. W hite and Jack pines; Norw ay I -anti W hite spruce, white astt
    ’ These trees are furnished free of ; charge by the S tate F orestry dei
    part ment. We hope th a t the cofi- [ tinued planting of tlu se trees will 1
    encourage every farm er to the j idea th at mora- trees should be I planted
    each year on every farm. » All oi the steep hills should be Mr and Mrs G. D.
    T albert ot St Cloud, Minnesota, and Mr. and Ms Alva Talbert and Mary Lou of
    Rice. Minnesota, called at the John Dennis home Monday a fte rnoon on their
    w ay home from Illinois. John LeRoy Dennis and Miss G ertrude Rosenow were
    quietly m arried or. Tuesday, May 2, in Tomah. Rev Bernard C Herrick of the
    Methodist Episcopal church officiating. Mr. D J. March of I^a Crosse and Mi.
    George Cook called at the I'ennis home to visit John L Dennis on Thursday of
    last week. For the turkey industry of the nation it is reported Uiat the
    crop will be larger than last year. But don’t give up. Ju st tend to feeding
    the baby poults. May as well get the C hristm as sp iiit now. Just think w
    hat tine C hristm as p re sents that wall be for someone. F arm ers are busy
    enough a fte r a rather late sta rt on account of slow drying of the fields.
    On th» lih! .‘>il the seeding is done but un the whole it is only nicely
    started. The weather, the past week has been ideal for field wa>rk and
    everywhere farinera are ta k ing advantage of it. Floyd Tessm an on the
    Charles Dickinson farm is nicely sta rted with his seeding. Mr. anti Mrs.
    Tessman moved here only recently and say they have their hands full to tio
    their farm work and chores. But they are a fte r it with all their might.
    They a ie fo rtu n ate to have convenient buildings. Mi Dickinson lost all
    hia barns and outbuildings in a cyclone and fire, the main barn suffering on
    both occasions. He has spared rv> effort, however, to put the be. t possible
    bulloings back in place ot those lost in the iaid: of th “ Yem enis A ^ood
    barn scraper can be made a fte r the fashion of one 1 noticed h;mging in th
    eir barn It was a piece of a cross-cut saw about 30 inches in length with a
    piece of iron pipe bolted to it for a handle. The pipe was split about three
    inches, the saw inserted in the slit and bolted in place. Why buy barn
    scrapers when you have worn out or broken cross-cut saw s around the place
    W. E. Brohaugh, living on the H arry Sweet farm , had just finished filling
    ditches in the tield. Last fall's heavy rains did considerable damage to
    fields in the way of ditching. He says he is of genuine Norw egian blood
    although he cannot speak the Norwegian language. He is a hard worker, and
    perhaps the Norwegian in him has something do do with it. There is plenty of
    work on the Sweet farm with 37 head of cattle. Mr. B ruhauçh takes pride in
    them, too. He expressed regret that his yearling heifers were not in the
    barn so I could see w hat a fine lot th e y were. He uas 2 milch cows. He
    says he has no use for old hens but feeds his pullets for egg production,
    evidently figuring th a t as soon a s they have passed their best production
    he can sell them and make room for a new flock His method of caring for his
    layers is to confine them to the house until noon. Then they will cat more
    laying mash th an they wrou!d if they were out where they could grass. Then
    at noon he lets them out to exercise and pick grass. He told me to go d wn
    to the brooder houses and see his chicks He has 500 sexed leghorns in two
    portable brooder houses. The houses being p ortable m akes it potssibie to
    haul them to a different location from year to year and thus avoid the
    danger of any disease th a t m ay be lurking in the soil from the previous
    year. To add to the comfortable, convenient buildings Mr. Sweet has Heeler
    anti Zahrte at work on a new tool shed and g arage, dimensions of which are
    IS»-, feet by 60 feet. W'alter Reekie has a farm of 50 acres, all improved,
    and says he gets good results from both crops and pasture by rotating. Mr.
    Reekie likes horses and has plenty of them There are six in all. He is
    breaking a 3-year old now and has a span of 2-year olds. M rs Reekie showed
    me a set of 36 dominoes. They are made of ivory and are the tiniest I ever
    saw. They m easure in. by s in. by in They were made by French soldiers and
    were brought to this country by an uncle of Mr Reekie. She thinks they must
    be 100 years old or more. The box in which they áre packed is also of ivory
    and m easures \ inch deep by 1 inch by 1 V inch. Mrs. W allace H eser is m
    aking a noble effort to keep the farm going while Wallace is in a hospital
    at Statesan. Mrs Heser rep o rts th at her husband is much improved and is
    looking forward to his return home She has George P u ttk am m er working
    the farm and says they are getting along fine w ith it. Since she has been
    This departm ent of the Journal has a contest starting this week to continue
    for ter days. As 1 talked with Earl Heser about school he told me he had
    been on the school board as trea su rer from 1912 to the present time, m
    aking a total of 26 years and he says that isn't off and on but continuous.
    He says th at the first one to notify him of longer continuous service to
    his or her school district, he will buy a picnrc of beer If you don’t 'l in
    k beer 1 don’t know- w hat to say. but would suggest th at you notify him
    just the same. It wrll at least be interesting for him to hear from you.He
    says by taking care of m achin » ry it will last for years His Champion
    mower, he says, Is 41 years old and the drag with which he was working is th
    at old or older but has been re built wnth his own hand, into a four bar
    instead of a five bar drag While Mr. Heser was dragging, his son Kenneth was
    busying himself with the lawai ant! other things about the . He tc»ok me
    into the basement wiiere he has a fine boat under construction. He Is also a
    taxiderm ist and makes a business of it. Mrs. Heser w ent to the S parta
    hospital in the forenoon for the removal ot her tonsils. At the Otis and
    Lynn Purdy place I lound only Mrs. Otis P u rdy w ith whom I talked a few
    minutes. I asked to look around the Lam and she told me to help myself.
    Besides keeping their buildings, barn and stock in repair and good shape,
    the Purdy’s have a beautiful aumm er resort near Trout Falls that commands
    considerable of their time. An item th at a ttrac ted my attention as I wa
    leaving was a gate post. It was a cement p.nst built into the ground with an
    old hot w ater tank jacketing the portion above ground. Many experim ents
    with cement poets have been made but w ithout success ;ts they will chip off
    and finally break The steel jacket is expected to prevent the j chipping and
    breaking. I believe Mr. Purdy has som ething there. John Clay J r on the W
    illard C rocker farm of 165 acres was seeding when I stopped there He says
    he g ets up early and cleans his barn before milking. Not a bad idea for san
    itary milk production. He says with his wife’.» help they manage w ithout
    hiring although there is work th ere for two if prices wauld permit. He said
    he couldn't help but notice the four o r five tra c to rs humming about the
    neighborhood, while he wais driving his team. He is for horses and I don’t
    blame him. H" has a mixed herd of cattle but is breeding into Guernseys.

    Young of Some Animals Weigh Little When Born It is claimed that new bom
    opossums weigh about four grains as compared with the mother's weight of ten
    pounds. The young are born with well-developed forelegs that enable them to
    crawl into the maternal pouch immediately after birth, where they remain f
    >r sme time It is stated that the kangaroo perhaps heads the list in this
    respect. The mother, sometimes taller than a man. gives birth to young that
    are less than one inch long. Both the opossum and kangaroo are the bestknoun
    members of pouched animals. called marsupials. The VQiing of the common
    uiaek bear, that are bom in hibernation, ueigh about ten ounces as compared
    with the mother’s weight of two hundred pounds or more. These three animals
    undoubtedly produce the smallest young m comparison to the weight U the

    Maybe it will rain yet. The Victor Schmieder farm has fine large lawm with
    suflarge elm s and oaks to make shade for a pleasant Sun dav afternoon. Mr.
    Schmieder had gone to Te>mah but Mrs. Schmieder was home. I snooped in and
    about the barn while she washed the separator. They have their barn repaired
    in goo»i shape in the short time they have owned the place. Mrs Schmieder
    says it was about ready to fall down when they took hold of the farm. One cf
    their sons had gone to their e»ther farm to work where I met him later in
    the afternoon. He .‘a y s they keep young cattle and horses, not in use,
    there, and Glenn Lawrence, who lives in the house, cares for the‘m during
    the w inter. They are raising their own horse, a fine way to get gentle,
    quiet horses There were two colts here, besides one only a few days old at

    est of Tom ah. th at passes the old fair grounds. Ju st at the south end of
    the fair grounds is a 200 acre farm o'lw4 by John Holzapfei. Mr. Holzapfei
    believes it is necessary to raise the crops th at produce the m ast income
    at th^ expense This y ear he intenels to plant corn and soybeans but will
    sow no oats at all as he figures by the tim e the plowing, harrow ing.
    siHsiing, harvesting and all the M.st of the trouble with them is over he
    could buy them cheaper. He has considerable low land on which he now has 12
    acres of canary grass to which he intends to add another j 20 or more acres
    this fall. He j plans to have his giound ready before freezing, then in
    November, or as soon as the ground is frozen, he can sow hi» canary grass so
    it will be ready for spring thaw ing As soon as the frost is out e>f the
    ground, he says, it will ^ sprout and get an early spring sta rt. A nother
    thing Mr. Holzapfei suggested was to saw his fence posts 4x4 inches. He
    believes they season out better than a split post and al.sT says they a ie
    much b etter for building electric fence. I» u is Meinecke lives just w est
    of the fair grounds in a com fortable little place with a large lawn adorned
    by oak trees. A fine place to entertain their friends or relatives a t a
    picnic. I noticed as I left the house that he has a few nicc fruit trees

    work for him. Mr. Hill has had his farm for many years and has his buildings
    in good shape and conveniently loeated for harm ing the chores His house an.
    the ten an t house are on opposite sides of the road and surrounded by fine
    shade trees of elm. On account of the hish w ater level carried he says he
    was unable to cut his m arsh last season, and also his pasture suffered. But

    ELEVATOR ASS’N. Tc‘d Sorenson m anages the farm I owned by his father, S G
    Sorenson. He h as IS beef steers ready for m arket in about a month, and
    says they have been grain fed since December Th farm has ;>00 acres »af land
    under the plow th at wall be divided this year into 45 acres of hay, 110
    com. 75 small sriain besides a few acres of other items. He sowed six acres
    of a lfalfa this spring fo r this year's cutting. This is a ncwr practice
    for thb p art of the country although it is practiced in other states where
    alfalfa is grown more extensively. Besides the f cattle they have a good
    herd of Holstein milch cattle. In the horse stable, Mrs. Sorenson says they
    have a royal family, Duke. Duchess. Prince and Ginger. Ginger I suppose
    represents the wasecracker of cent u n e s passed, who use»d to try with his
    stu n ts and toasts to amuse the king W ith It' biood sows and 73 pigs,
    their pens arc equipped so it is necessary to w ater the hogs only once in
    three days and till the feeders only once in 10 days. They have their lawn
    and yard all plowed and a fine young orchard set in back and will hace the
    lawn fixed up later on. E rnest H untington works steady for them and du
    rang haying, says Ted, they employ eight men. On the Keller farm I found
    14.410 feet cf newdy sawed oak lumber. I did not stop to scale it but took E
    arl’s W’ord for it He says he will build a bam 36x90 feet Besides the lumber
    they obtained the stone for the basement and the sand for the m ortar He
    also intends to build a pig pen and adjoining the barn will be a milk hoiLse
    Edward M atzke is w orking the farm on shares and says he has his seeding1
    done is plowing for C4>m now. Besides 18 milk cow’s and three heifers at the
    farm they have some fine early pigs that will be on the m arket early in the
    fall. I^eo Gasper h as an enviable farm I found the hired man. O tto Huff,
    ehoring about the brn. L ^ was building fence. Miss C arry ouite busy says
    she goes to school during the forenoon, but not a fte r dinner. On returning
    from the upper end of the valley I stopped where Leo was fencing. He has
    about 50 head of cattle and says he has plenty of feed. He says he is
    satisfied w ith the w>ay his farm is producing. He was building a tem porary
    fence around an old meadow to pasture till he gets ready to plow it. He uses
    electric fence and says he is well pleased with the results He doesn't
    intend to raise any small grain as he can buy the oats he neeels cheaper
    than he can bother raising them. For his silo be intends to do some
    experimenting this year For his experim ent lie intemds to put in a m ixture
    of su g ar cane and sorgo. This is recommended by experim ent statio n s and
    it will be interesting to w atch for the re sults here in one of our own
    comm unities. He says besides his living he has bought a new car this year
    besides a truck and that it j all came out of the farm . I spoke of his
    buildings and he said he 1 had the paint fa r a complete white job and
    expected to have it Jeme this year. Oscar Chapman, a son of Fred, i is on
    the home farm. He was ' wolfing for his horses to finish j their dinner so
    he could hitch up. j His horses are in shape for serv- I ice, too. He has
    five, and until j recently had six but sold one. j He expect ed to finish

    in favor of promoting Tomah’s interests and are willing to sup port this
    interest with substa n tia l m em bership contributions. It is firm ly
    believed th at Tomah is facing opportunities which have possibilities of
    beneficial development and it is natural th at those whose interests are in

    by Power Company Work has been started on 14 miles of new transm ission line
    between T'»mah and Camp Douglas by the Wisconsin Power Light Co.. which will
    provide a new source of energy for Camp Douglas. H ustler and M auston when
    it is completed The work will involve a large crew of w orkers for a month
    to six weeks and will cost approxim ately $30.000. Energy is transm itted to
    Camp Douglas at present on a line from N dah. but this line will be
    abandoned as soon as the new line is completed. Numerous reasons prom pted
    the buildir^. the new line, chief among \ fv was the necessity lor heaw cr
    carrying lmes and the m atter ot operation. It is pointed out th a t no new
    lines will be necessary between ( amp Douglas and H ustler ami Mauston, the
    present lines being adequate to c a rry the load d em ands Among the changes
    which will follow the building of the new Tornah-Camp Douglas line will b th
    e removal of the sub-station from Necedah to Tomah, which will eventually
    lessen the cost ot operation. The sub-station in T omah will be located on
    the company's property on K Milwaukee This new line between Toman and Camp
    Douglas will be of benefit in various ways, it is pointed out by F! A
    Söderström, district superintendent of the company. Increased transm ission
    capacity, concentration of operation and less mileage in transm ission and
    upkeep costs will result from this improvement, together with an improved
    service to the communities to be served. SPARTA HI-ATS TOMAH, 3 TO 1. HERE

    'S. Js has his farm all in hay so has no spring farm ing to do He says lie
    has a Holstein COW and a Guernsey cow th a t have their milk test reversed.
    T h e Holstein testing 5.5' i and t h e Guernsey tests hut 4.2. The order is
    usually reversed, the Guernseys testing highes t. A It Libke \s com fortably
    »- c a t'd between Pauquctte’s and Honel’s surrounded by a nice windbreak on
    the west and north I didn’t try to go there on ac ¡ count of the grader I
    don’t think Adolph will feel slighted though Maybe I can do bett r next
    time. Having read this far you must surely understand that “Bill Krase was w
    orking the road so, now, we'll go on. » Joe Schmidt, just a little fu rth er
    west and living north of th railroad tracks, has his farm so he catches the
    earliest, warm, buildings on a south facing slope spn n g sUnshine. He says
    his buildings were over the hill near Deer Creek till a had storm onenight
    caused the stream to overflow. flooding his barn and nearly drowning his
    cattle. 8 affer th a t he moved them to their present desiiable location.
    There ir“ 174 acres in tlu place ami the Schm idt's have owned it for 39
    years. There w re but 40 \ of the farm cleared when they bought it but a
    good abate of it is under cultivation now He has about two acres of good
    cranberry m arsh. In his le>w land Mr. Schmidt has some tile but says he
    prefers an open ditch Deer Creek is only in its beginning . it flows through
    the Schmidt farm and Mr. Schmidt has straightened it. He sta rte d the job
    by plowing out, first four fu rrows. then three and then two and let the w
    ater finish the joo by washing the mud k>wn stream . I noticed that Mr
    Schmklt is very particular a)>ut his s ee d potatoes He plants the whole
    potatoe but cu ts the eyes off the seed ond to prevent the grow th of too
    many vanes. • Lloyd Jones has a nice looking place and has considerable
    she>re line on Lake Tomah. At present he is building a cottage 18x36 He was
    busy supet vising and helpine with the work on the cottajre His son and
    brother were plowing for com. • • • Mr and M! s. Alvin W arnka live on th^
    Ida Bacon farm of 45 acres. Mrs. Bacon is Mrs. W arn ka’s m other a;d is
    staying with them at present. Alvin was away hut Mrs W arnka w ar at home.
    She said they had eight children but lost one ree-ently. and says it there
    were a hnspitnl in Toman that one. might also be alive They have a good
    sized bed of etiaw - buildlngs a n painteet gray The lawn is large and shady
    and the renters try to keep things nea and clean. W hen landlady ami renter
    take m utual interest in a place they are quite likely to gel along. Over a
    window on the porch I noticed two bird rest.1 side by side. There w as >
    sort of sm all brow r bird settin g on one, while the other. Mrs Zas- MAY

    ind flower garden is attractive. | Now. w hat a lot of tim e and hard The
    only flowers in bloom at pres- ; labor that little bird could have eat are
    two bushes of flowering a l - ! saved by using the old nest. But, mond In
    the center of the lawn is a windmill about 4 feet high. Several sm aller
    ornam ents are a rrayed around the flower beds. The ornam ents were made bv
    their son Glen of La P’arge. A liottle in which he has set up m iscellaneous
    article®, all larger than the ne curiosity. In it u» a bucksaw, saw buck,
    ax. maul and ladder. Mrs. Vinz has quite a display of handmade rugs how
    often do you see a haughty ; little female using anything second- hand # • m
    A it Thompson bought thev old H astings faim several years ago It is located
    a t the underground j crossing of the Milwaukee railf the bottle, is quite a
    | road near Tunnel City w ith land on! both sides of the track. Buildings
    are good and Art keeps things] where they belong. The old barn still stands
    and is used for o th er j Virgil A row of butternut tr ees along ! purposes
    than for a barn the road have shown w oedetiul; results from trim m ing. Mr
    Vin says they were nearly all dead when he s ta rte d on them with a saw and
    says they sta rte d to grow and do b etter a fte r trim ing One tree was
    especially closely trimmed, as can be seen at a glance, but is coming in
    good iiape now. # Gael Jones, next on the list, wa. pi w ing for his
    brother, Lloyd. He has his own corn p lan ting done and is going to plant
    for Lloyd as soon as the ground is plowed and ready. Mrs. Jones w as home.
    She said I couldn't write a sto ry about their farm so maybe I b etter not
    try. But, I can t help but mention that they have been there but two years,
    having bought the place two years ago. They have made big improvements in
    those two years, j Most im portant is a w a ter plant. ; They have a
    pressure well giving J w ater to both house' and barn, j with drinking cups
    in the bam. Friday was the first real warm day we have had since March and a
    glance at a coeil grove of pines»- near the edge nf the lake made one feel
    like going down there to cool off. They have considerable land on the lake.
    As tim e goes on they m ay l>e able to realize something in the w ay of a
    sum m er resort from it. Their lawn is long, the house being some distance
    from the road. They have done some work on the lawn, especially in the rear
    e»f th e house by filling an old drivew ay and setting young trees. + » I
    went on up the pike to Myron Shies. Mr and Mrs. Shie and family arc located
    on the Fm nerty place. Mrs Shie was doing her share about the house while 4
    y ion worked at his corn ground An alfalfa field across the fence from where
    he was working Hwws signs of dry weather. He stated th at from nine aeres of
    meadow, last year, he cut hav enough to feed three horses anel 30 head of
    cattle. This year he has 13 acres and says he expects his hay mow vtll be
    rath er skimpy. He h as had plenty of experience w ith thistles, having put
    a lcrt of them out of business in the few years he has been on the faiTn He
    says th a t the best uray to kill them and quack g rass is by cultivation ra
    the r th an by plowing. Jim Oliver lives on the old home place, at the top
    of a steep ridge overlooking t h e scheiol house He has only 30 acres in his
    farm and works out in his spare time He is a carpenter and is working at
    present on the Lloyd Jones cottage. Mrs. Oliver was at home and busying
    herself with a hoe. digging damkdions out of her lawn. They have- a shade
    tree there that she savs Jim planted when he was four years old. He nurseo
    it during its infancy and it has grown in fact it’s grown lots faster than
    Jim did till now it's much bigger than its paient. They have a fine straw
    berry bod and should pick a lot of berries, m any more than they will use at
    home. There were berries as large as hickory nut Friday. Besides their
    fruit, and berries they have 13 head of nice looking Guernseys that they
    feed from the fa rm ’ A cistern supplies w ater to the barn and house. e
    Henry Zastoupll owns the old Zastoupil home and is continually improving it
    The place has been in the family for 40 years. Ho is always trying the
    modern methods, too. He mixes his own dairy ration, He lets his soy beans
    ripen before cutting therm Then when they are ready to grind he grinds 10
    sacks. He then mixes this with enough ear corn and oats to m a k e 25 sacks.
    To this he adds enough bran to make an %rf ration He has set aside a 3-acre
    tra c t of land a t the rquest of County Agent Begley a mi the Tomah high
    school agricultural teacher, Mr Wetner, for an experim ent with comm ercial
    fertilizers. T h e soil has been tested arid four tons of lime applied The
    trac t has been divided into 3 p a rts w ith a control 12 feet wide To the
    first part, a plot of !»•> acres, was applied .45 pounds super phosphate and
    85 pounds of m uriate of potash. To the next ;2 acre was applied It» ponrds
    of 10-6-4 (fertilizer, and to the balance, 1 acre, has been applied Mo
    pounds of supei phosphate On these small fields will be sowed a pasture m
    ixture of timothy, red clover, alfalfa, sweet 1 and broom grass. The idea is
    to find out what the return of ach plot will be in proportion to the am ount
    expended on it. The I land may be pastured some this fall but real returns
    are e x ^ td to show next year. Let s w atch this. The agriculture class
    will also set 1000 trees of various kinds of the pines and probably try ther
