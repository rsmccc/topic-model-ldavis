FORTY-SIXTH YEAH. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN, THURSDAY, APRIL 20, 1939 NUMBER 23
B u d g e t in g S t a t e S p e n d in g
Budgeting state spending for the
next biennium is perhaps the most important
task of any legislature. Its
importance is borne out by the time,
deliberation and thought that is given
it by the governor, budget director
and legislature.
The budget is the first job and
worry of an incoming governor. Im mediately
after election he begins by
conducting hearings with state department
officials. They, the department
heads, present their estimates of
costs for the coming two years and
the Governor then prepares his budget,
and as required by law, presents
it to the legislature by the first of
February.
Weeks and weeks of public hearings
are then held by the joint finance committee
after which they too make recommendations
for the budget. The
budget then must receive approval of
both bouses and the signature of the
governor before it becomes law.
The 1939-40 budget bill was presented
to the assembly by the joint
finance committee last week. Expenditure
recommendations by the committee
exceed those made by Governor
Heil by $1,726,246.
The early budget hearings held by
Governor Heil immediately after his
election revealed total requests of
more than 96 million dollars. Governor
Heil cut this figure to 66 million.
There is no provision for relief in
the budget bill. Senator Otto Mueller,
Wausau, finance committee chairman,
reports that a separate relief bill will
be introduced later. Estimates are
that it will take at least 4 million and
possibly 5 million dollars to care for
relief for the next two years. I f the
legislature approves the budget as
recommended by the finance committee,
the added relief costs will make
the 1939-40 budget the highest in the
state’s history, even with the d r a s t i'
cuts given the University, the stat»
teachers’ colleges a n d state a n d pen a 1
institutions.
( l a m e V io la t io n F ine s
The senate vigorouslv debated th«
justice of the present $50 minimum
fine for fish and game law violation!
•be fore they moved toward final passage
a bill which lowers the minimum
fine from $.r>0 to $10 except for deer
bear and sturgeon.
As originally introduced by Senator
Allen Busby, Milwaukee. Progressive,
the bill provided for a minimum fine
of $1 except in deer law cases.
Amendments made the amount $10,
except for deer, bear and sturgeon,
where the minimum stays at $50.
The new bill allows judges to use
their own discretion in setting the fine
at any amount between $10 and $100.
Chief criticism of the $50 minimum
fine was that it was too drastic,
pecially in cases where only minor
violations of the laws were involved.
Reduction of the minimum fine was
vigorously opposed by Senators Bolens,
FreehofT, Sauld and Brown
Brown, Oshkosh Republican, won a
point by having sturgeon, game fish,
exempted from the law. Senator
Brown claims that even with a $50
minimum fine, game violators can
make money by catching and selling
sturgeon at 80c and $1 a pound and
allowing for two arrests a seMoYi;
Bolens and FreehofT were particularly
concerned with the protection of game
birds in Ozaukee and Waukesha counties.
Bolens claimed that a $10 fine
for Milwaukee sportsmen, whom he
declares are behind this bill, is nothing
at all. and will invite game violations
particularly in the case of game
birds.
F a r m L e g is la tio n
That legislators view with alarm
from both economic and political
standpoints the present critical condition
of the dairy industry is shown by
the fact that numerous bills affecting
agriculture have been recently introduced
in the legislature.
Each of the three major political
parties last fall promised a cost of
production program for the farmers.
First evidence of such a program was
embodied in a bill introduced by Assemblyman
John Pritchard, Progressive,
which would allow the department
of agriculture and markets to
hold hearings to determine the cost of
production for each year. During the
year the department would publish
daily the minimum milk price, which
dealers would have to pay. It would
be based on costs of production, current
supply and demand, and competing
market quotations. All dealers
would be licensed. To protect the state
markets from competing states, a tax
could be levied on products coming
into the state at a price lower than
GIANT TROUT
Thurlow Jacobson yesterday was
displaying a 32-inch, 10\ pound German
brown trout that he had pulled
out of the Jacobson trout pond northwest
of town. The big fellow had
been feeding on small trout in the
pond. Mr. Jacobson says there are a
couple of others just as big, or bigger,
left in the pond that must also be removed
to save the smaller trout.
the cost of production.
A bill also was introduced which extends
the present fluid milk control
law, first enacted in 1933 and reenacted
in 1935 and 1937, with changes to
meet existing conditions. The present
law has the department hold hearings
and fix fluid milk prices in cities
where producers or dealers petition
for price fixing. The new bill would
make the law permanent, and requires
the department, whenever practicable,
to establish normal ratios between
fluid milk prices and general prices.
Another bill establishes fair practices
for cheese factories, eondenseries,
creameries, and milk plants. It
prohibits furnishing of milk containers
to producers below costs and requires
producers to bear hauling costs.
The other two bills introduced would
set up a legislative committee to hold
solve the farm situation; and would
levy a two-cent sales tax to pay milk

Such was the parting shot of Albania's
King Zog as he fled Italian
invasion. Symbolic of British-
French lethargy were Mr. Chamberlain’s
warships, which lay at anchor
off Greek Corfu, within cannon
range of the invader. One shot,
said Zog, would have stopped the
Italians. But one shot m ight also
have been the sendoff for a conflict
more frightful than the one which I
started from a pistol shot at nearby
Sarajevo 25 years ago.
When II Duce captured Albania,
a month had passed since Britain
and France dropped their futile appeasement
policy for a Stop Hitler
—Step Mussolini program. Poland,
R um an ia and Turkey were fairly
well lined up with the democracies

Meanwhile Berlin's covetous eyes
began looking at Switzerland and |
the Netherlands, while Herr Doktor
P a ul Joseph Goebbels shouted from j
his propaganda office a German an- j
swer to the key question facing Eu- ;
rope today: Will Britain really fight J
to defend any lesser European na- !
tion’s independence?
Herr Goebbels said no, and many
an alert Britisher said the same
thing, wondering if aggressive Germany
and Italy were not right in
maintaining that Great Britain has
passed her empirical peak and is
falling into decadence. Under the
appeasement policy it was only
passingly embarrassing for Mr.
Chamberlain to make repeated concessions
for peace’s sake. But under
the new policy Britain at last faces
reality; Europe's dictators are obviously
forcing a showdown to demonstrate
that Mr. Chamberlain will
never flght to protect them, therefore
the little nations had best beg
for mercy from H itler and Mussolini.
Hence observers agree the worst
of Europe's recurrent crises— and
England's, too— may come within
the present month. Neither Britain
nor France have backed up their
new umbrella-waving policy in the
case of Albania, whose occupation
was a direct violation of the Anglo-
Italian pact of 1938. A swift German
jab at Poland or an Italian
march into Greece would provide
the ultimate test; if Britain fails to
march in such a situation, then European
democracies are indeed decadent
and the Old World has new
undisputed masters in Hitler and
Mussolini. At the same time Mr.
Cham berlain’s government would
undoubtedly collapse.
On the other hand, if Britain and
France act to block the next dictator
aggression, there is a pathetically
good likelihood of general European
warfare.
Trade
State trade barriers are usually
brainchildren of panicky, depression-
ridden legislatures. Though sectional
barriers (like North-sponsored i
high freight rates In alleged discrimination
against poorer Southern
states) are also to blame, most of
them spring from a forlorn hope
that the individual commonwealth
can protect its own prosperity by
discriminating against tradesmen
from neighboring states Sample
barriers are: (1) preference to
home-state industries, often resulting
in monopolies nnd exorbitant
prices; (2) excessively high license
rates for out-of-state truckers; (3)
unreasonable sanitary laws which
bar dairy imports.
Most such regulations tread on
questionable ground, assuming
round-about jurisdiction over interstate
commerce which is really a
federal power. Early this year
Washington became so alarmed that
several officials like Secretary of
Agriculture Henry A. Wallace
threatened to use a federal mallet
to knock down the barriers. The
most important result came from
intervention by the Council of State
Governments which called a “ national
conference on interstate trade
barriers" in Chicago. Surprisingly,
though most of the 44 states represented
were themselves guilty, they
condemned barriers to a man. A
clear-cut prophecy, actually key-

noting the session, came from Missouri's
Gov. Lloyd C. Stark:
"The point is this: If the states
try to get these additional revenues
at the expense of their neighbors
they are gaining only a temporary
advantage. They are laying the
groundwork for an unprecedented
economic breakdown and eventually
nationwide financial chaos which
will affect their own citizens along
with citizens of all other states.”
Assents came from U. S. Solicitor
Gen. Robert H. Jackson and Fred I.
Kent of the American Bankers' association.
Principal dissent was
from Arkansas' Gov. Carl Bailey,
whose complaint about sectionally
discriminating freight rates was
Anally included in the conference's
resolutions. Other condemnations:
(1) discriminatory state alcoholic
beverage laws; (2) sales taxes and
"u s e " taxes, in states where no
"offset" provision is made for goods
produced in another state having
sales tax; (3) discriminatory out-ofstate
truck permits.
Homeward bound delegates were
admonished to work generally for
uniform regulations among the various
states. If they must discrim inate,
it was decided to do it " d i rectly,
and not by masquerading under
the taxing power." But every
delegate knew it would be a touglk
job—even political suicide—to destroy
the invisible barriers which
folks back home consider a justifiable
protection for their state's industries.

A viatio n
Some 4,100 miles southwest of San
Francisco and 3,250 miles northeast
of Australia, just south of the equator,
are Canton and Enderbury islands,
the former named for a Massachusetts
whaler wrecked there in
1854. Both islands went officially
unclaimed until March, 1938, when
President Roosevelt saw them as a
vital link in U. S. defense and a logical
base for trans-Paciflc aviation.
When Great B ritain disputed the
claim it waa announced last August
that both countries would use the islands
for commercial aviation, but
not until recently was • formal
treaty signed. Its 50-year provisions:
U. S. and British administrators will
reside there, exercising powers to
be determined by consultation;
American interests will build an airport,
to be used by British aircraft
in return for a fee.
Pacific aviation is boomed by the
pact, for Canton and Enderbury lie
only 1,850 miles from Hawaii, directly
on the route a ship would take
to Sydney, Australia. Canton boasts
a quiet lagoon nine miles long and
three miles wide, ideal for planes.
But aviation to the contrary, many
a congressman was dubious when
asked to ratify the treaty. Reason:
If Britain were involved in war, an
attack on British property in the P acific
might force the U. S. to defend
the islands, thereby getting its own
feet in the international puddle.
A g ricu ltu re
While congress wrestles with a
huge U. S. cotton surplus which
threatens to engulf southern planters
unless it can be dumped abroad,
department of agriculture officials
begin to see a faint sunrise over the
lyige mountain of wheat which constitutes
the other m ajor part of
America s farm problem. With winter
wheat well under way and spring
planting estimates taking definite
form, the situation might be sum marized
as follows:
In 1938 the total U. S. wheat production
was 931,000,000 bushels (687,-
000.000 in winter wheat, 244,164,000
in spring wheat). But 1939’s winter
planting is cut to 46,173,000 acres
compared with 56.355,000 last year,
and spring planting is dropping
about 17 per cent under 1938. Thus
1939 prospects are for slightly more
than 700,000,000 bushels, only a mite
above normal domestic requirements.
This means the Ju ly 1 surplus
of 275,000,000 bushels (compared
with 154.000,(MX) bushels a year
previous) will be reduced if export
volume is maintained during the
coming season.
The " i f * remains a big factor.
however. U. S. delegates to the
forthcoming world wheat conference
can boast that America leads the
way in trying to slash surpluses,
but that accomplishment holds little
satisfaction because pace-setting
U. S. farmers can find no nation falling
in line behind them. With most
European plantings bigger than last
year, with Argentina just harvesting
its second largest crop on record,
and with Canada almost certain to
offer a price guarantee, there rem
ains slight hope that A m e ric a’s
carry-over from last year will be
reduced materially by sale abroad.

New Deal Democrats talk

WASHINGTON.—I t ’s rather curious
that tor some weeks now one
hears more talk about Republican
victory in 1940 from Democrats,
and p articu larly from New Deal
Democrats, than from Republicans.
This is not just a strange situation.
There is plenty of logic back
of it. Some of it is founded on cold
reason. But a good deal of it is
propaganda.
The answer to why there is not too
much talk of Republican victory
from the G. O. P. leaders themselves
is that they realize their own
weakness. Despite the Republican
victories last fall in many states,
which had been held by the Democrats
for six years, most of the
states are still ruled by the Democratic
party.
The importance of this lies in organization.
It means that the Dem ocrats
have the state house crowd,
men on the state payroll who want
to stay there, and whose m a in job
next year w ill be carrying their own
states for the Democratic ticket regardless
of who is the presidential
nominee and what may happen to
be written in the platform.
Most politicians believe that control
of the county governments
is more important than control of
the state government when it comes
to carrying a state in an election.
And by the same token the Democrats
are in control of a tremendous
m ajo rity of the county governments
in this country.
Most Democrats Don't Want
A Conservative  andidate
Then, too, a careful survey of the
1938 election does not present the
bright forecast for Republican success
which some seem to think. If
the Democrats in 1940 can only
hold the states they carried beyond
question in 1938. leaving out such
doubtful problems as Indiana, Iowa
and Colorado, they will have a comfortable
m argin ui the electoral college.
Moreover, the Republicans don’t
like the idea of getting too enthusiastic
until they know who their leade
r is apt to be. Thomas E. Dewey
is way out in front now, but there
is plenty of talk about Senator Robert
A. Taft of Ohio, and Governor
Jo h n W. Bricker of Ohio, and others.
On the Democratic side there is an
entirely different situation. Down
in their hearts most of the Democrats,
especially of the New Deal
variety, believe the Democratic party
will be successful again—but—
they would never think of conceding
that the party can win with a conservative
as the nominee!
F or instance, most New Dealers
would regard the nomination of a
m an like Senator H arry Flood Byrd
of V irginia, or Josiah W. Bailey of
North Carolina as little short of a
catastrophe, and none of them
would throw their hats up in the air
over the idea of John Nance Garner
being nominated.
So the strategy of these New Dealers
at present :s to keep the Democrats
scared about the next election.
Whatever Is Done About
Colton Is Sure to Be Wrong
Only one thing seems sure about
the cotton situation. That is that
whatever is done will turn out to be
wrong. In fact, economists who
have studied the situation, who
know about the rest of the world as
well as about the United States, and
whose judgment is not affected by
political considerations, say frankly
that not one of the proposed plans
will work in the long run; that all
of them would be expensive as well
as futile
With hindsight, the nonpolitical
experts say they could have rem edied
thc situation had they started
on it in 1928. Now, they are not
sure that anything could be done.
But as a matter of fact, this hindsight
would have been of no practical
value, for the simple reason
that even if one could have foreseen
the future, back in 1928, it is inconceivable
that a politically minded
government would have taken the
proper course. It would have
seemed too brutal—too hard on thc
cotton farmers—at the time.
The year 1928 is picked not because
it was the year before the
business crash began, but because
in a way it m arks the starting of
Brazil on its path to becoming one
of the great cotton producing countries
of the world. It was the year
before President Hoover began to
worry about the fa rm problem. It
was before the fa rm board of that
administration. For there is no
doubt whatever that it has been federal
interference with the natural
course of cotton growing that has
raised the present problem.
Let's look at thc history of cotton
before that. Every now nnd then
there would be a terrible overproduction,
the price would go to pot.
and the southern statesmen would
scream their heads off about the
census bureau issuing misleading
figures, or the gamblers on the cotton
exchange preying on the poor
farmers, or something of the sort.
Then, another season would see
fairly good prices, and every one in
the cotton states would be so happy
that no one up north would even
hear that the trouble was over.
Every time the rest of the country
heard about cotton it was the bad
news, not the good.
Scheme Was Set Up Which
Made the Trouble Permanent
With the Hoover fa rm board ln
action, however, a scheme was set
up which inevitably m ade the
trouble permanent instead of just
every few years. For a century
before that the British cotton m ill
owners had been hoping to develop
some other section of the world as
a cotton producer. They wanted
something which would prove a
check on high cotton prices in the
short-crop years.
Every one interested in cotton
could see that, with the starting of
this idea of the government doing
something for the cotton farmers,
the period of occasional low prices
for cotton had gone forever—that is
the possibility of the United States
dumping a cotton surplus at very
low prices had passed. This was
made even more clear when the
United States government started
paying farmers not to grow cotton.
With this "g u ara n te e " of high
world prices, development of cotton
growing in other areas grew by
leaps and bounds. Uncle Sam was
holding an um bre lla over them.
Danger of cheap cotton from the
United States in any particular year
was averted.
As a result of this, B razil expanded
her cotton growing. She found
that she could sell cotton at six cents
a pound and make money. There
has never been a chance since that
she would abandon this expansion,
for there is not a state east of the
Mississippi where cotton can be produced,
at a profit, at any such
price.
Appeasement Program Helped
O nly T uo Big Corporations
Curiously enough, apparently the
only two big corporations in the
country which profited from the
“ appeasement" program—during
this short span of life—were the big
electric utility holding companies
which President Roosevelt is known
to dislike so cordially. One of these
is Electric Bond and Share. The
other is Commonwealth and Southern.
It will be recalled that one of the
most convincing steps in the socalled
appeasement program was
the agreement on the part of TVA
to buy out the interests in C hattanooga
of the Commonwealth and
Southern, and in Memphis of the
Electric Bond and Share (this latter
held through a subsidiary).
At the time these agreements
were made, H arry L. Hopkins had
been talking to senators and m em bers
of the house as to the necessity
of doing something to encourage
business.
One of the m ain reasons for “ appeasing”
the electric industry was
that Hopkins had been thoroughly
sold by the arguments for the preceding
18 months by W illiam O.
Douglas, now on the Supreme court,
that if something could be done to
encourage the electric industry,
there would be such a flood of spending
that it would be almost enough
alone and unaided to produce the
return of prosperity.
But a fa r more im portant part
of the appeasement program , and
one which affected all business and
new investment instead of merely
the electric business, was tax revision.
President Intervenes in
Fight for Bevision of Taxes
Suddenly the President intervened
in the fight for tax revision with an
u ltim atum which seems to have definitely
ended all chance for it. This
does not apply, of course, to the postponement
of the increase in the social
security taxes, but to the levies
on corporations.
His u ltim atum was that if any reduction
should be made in the estimated
revenues, this m ust be
made up by adding additional taxes
somewhere else—but on the corporations.
In short, his verdict is that
congress m ay shuffle the present
taxes on business in any way it may
deem to be helpful, but that the net
result—in estimated revenues—must
be the same.
What so many of his lieutenants
had hoped, and this goes not only
for im portant members of the house
and senate but for the treasury department
and the department of
commcrce, was that the government
would take a chance—that it would
encourage business by reducing
taxes on business, hoping that business
would thereupon boom, and the
actual revenues of the treasury
would be increased by the reduction
rather than cut.
This phase of the problem the
President ignored completely. He
still insists that if estimated revenues
are reduced, then government
spending, for relief or something
else, m ust be reduced to precisely
the same amount. He attacks the
problem ju st as though the federal
budget were now balanced, and any
reduction of the corporation taxes
would throw it out of balance.
This has divided business as to
the tax revision, will keep it divided
unless congress forces the gamble
on the President, which does not
now seem likely.

EW Y O R K .—On August 2 of thi*

Dr. Eisen at 91 t a t i v e c h a l -
S till Delves Into lenge, the Chal-
Past an d Future ice of Antioch
as the “ oldest
surviving record of the faith of the
Apostles." The chalice was exhibited
during holy week et St. Thomas
Episcopal church, New York,
with the conjecture that its inner
cup may have been the beginning
of the legend of the Holy Grail. In
a book published in 1926, Doctor
Eisen established the use of the
chalice in the Church at Antioch not
later than the end of the first century
of the Christian era.
At the age of 85, Doctor Eisen
learned to decipher cuneiform
inscriptions, to write a treatise
on Mesopotamian cylindrical
seals, or glyptics. In 1936, he
published 15 volumes s um m arizing
his research in legends of
the Holy G rail, and is now at
work on studies of early portraits
of Christ and the apostles.
His eyesight and hearing are
still good and he puts in a full
working day.
Doctor Eisen has published more
than 150 books covering his amazing
range of inquiry in a half-dozen sciences,
including studies of earthworks,
fig culture, archeology, ancient
grass, portraits of George
Washington and geological, zoological
and botanical subjects.
Born in Sweden, he was a fra il
child, unable to attend school, frequently
in the
Horticulture I t country, with
Modern F ie ld tutors w h o
O f the Scientist stimulated his
scientific interests.
In the University of Upsala,
he wrote a thesis on earthworks
which attracted the attention of
Charles Darwin. His correspondence
with Darwin put h im in touch
with Alexander E. Agassiz, the
American naturalist, and, when he
obtained his doctorate in 1873 and
removed to America, the two men
formed a long and fruitful association.
For 40 years, Doctor Eisen
was on the Pacific coast, working
at times with the late Luther Burbank
on plant research.
Last year, the California
Academy of Science honored
him as the founder of the state’s
great fig-growing industry.
Smyrna figs frequently had been
taken to California, but there
was no yield. Doctor Eisen
studied this problem and
reached the conclusion that the
failure was due to lack of fertilization.
Male trees were
brought over and California began
gathering fig crops.
The chalice, which had been found
in the ancient ruins of Antioch in
1910 and placed in the Louvre, in
Paris, was brought to this country
in 1914, to safeguard it during the
war. Doctor Eisen’s conclusion was
that it had been made by a great
Rom an artist, Appollodorus, who
lived from 50 to 120 A. D.
Doctor Eisen's avid scientific
studies continue on, unabated, into
his tenth decade. He is a bachelor.
None has ranged farther into the
past, while pressing eagerly into the
future in his zest for knowledge.
O N A cotton patch in the high
' “ ^m ountains of North Carolina, a

he did follow
the lingering plume of smoke and
that is linked, in the long chain of
causation, with the Sperry corporation's
harbinger of one more spring.
Thc lad with the hoe, one Thomas
A. Morgan, president of the corporation,
announces a net income of
$4,961,398 for 1938, against $2,949,860
the year before.
He joined the navy when he
hung up his hoe, qualified as an
electrician, and, running a gyroscope.
sank his career in this
magic whirligig. That geared
him in with the Sperry company,
and, just as the great war
was breaking, he chased the
C ia r ’s navy all over the fareastern
m ap to sell it gyroscopes.
He caught up with it
and rang up a sale, in one of
the epics of free American enterprise.
Thereafter he planted gyroscopes
on all the great fighting ships of the
world and sailed a true course to
the presidency of the Sperry corporation
in 1928. He became one of

The tu n was behind a bank of
clouds and a light breeze had sprung
up. When they took their places
Rex calm ly seated himself beside
Joan. No need to consider Stuyvesant
now, or be jealous of him. Stuyvesant
was annexed and labeled as
the property of another girl. The
talk was general and much livelier
than it had been earlier in the day.
Stuyvesant and Hale were in high
spirits. The others did their best
to share the mood.
“ It will really be nice to have you
in New York,” Joan told Hale un-^
der cover of the m ild discussion be-'
tween Stuyvesant and Bert. " I ’m
thinking of lots of things you can do
for me. Besides," she added serenely,
" I ’d rather live in New York
than in Chicago or C alifornia."
Hale shook his head at her.
“ Y o u ’re trying to upset my
poise,” he said severely. " I t can’t
be done. Besides, m y present plan
is to die of a hopeless love for you.
I can’t do that if you keep on encouraging
me with these flirtations.
I revive every time you smile at
me. How the devil can I die if you
keep on sm iling ?”
“Couldn't you give up the funeral
and live for m e ? ” Jo a n wanted to
know. Rut again Hale shook his
head at her.
" I will not m a r ry you, Jo a n ," he
said firmly. "N e ith e r will I let you
m arry me. But you’re driving me
to desperate measures. I think I ’ll
offer m y heart and hand in selfdefense
to Aunt Hosanna. She can
protect m e ."
" I doubt it,” Jo an said thoughtfully.
"She isn’t even up to protecting
Mrs. Spencer Forbes.”
Hale shot a quick look at her.
“ Just what do you mean by th a t?”
“ Nothing. I t ’s merely one of those
enigm atic remarks that keep my
friends guessing.” She dropped the
subject so definitely that Hale almost
heard it fall.
The consultation with Doctor Nick
Crosby the following Tuesday morning
was brisk and business-like.
Crosby in his office was a very different
person from the chatty man
o f the world he had been on Mrs.
Nash's veranda, during Rex’s first
meeting with him . At Joan's suggestion
Bert had the first appointment.
At Bert's suggestion Rex accompanied
him into the private office.
It was assumed without discussion
that Jo a n ’s examination would take
more time. All Bert said was that
he was nervously run down, and
wanted help in upbuilding. Crosby
made some tests, asked some questions.
gave him some advice, and
wrote out a prescription, all inside,
of twenty minutes. Then Joan went
in to the doctor alone, and the two
young men waited for her in the
ante-room. She was gone threequarters
of an hour. When the doctor
had bowed her out of his private
office, Rex muttered a word of apology
and went into the consultingroom
himself. There he faced the
doctor expectantly.
“ W e ll?” he asked.
Crosby shrugged.
“ Everything in Kneeland’s case
confirms what you told me in our
talk last night. He’ll soon be all
right, with proper care and treatm
e nt.”
"A nd Miss Kneeland?”
" I 'm not so sure about her. I
don’t like some of her symptoms.
It's too soon to be definite. I want
to watch her a while.”
"W h a t do you think the trouble
is? Surely you must have some notio
n.”
“ I'm holding my notions in abeyance.
She may have nothing but a
nasty case of indigestion. That can
play the very mischief with a patient,
once it gets a bad start. I ’ve
given her a tonic. I ’ve told her not
to eat anything between meals, and
to avoid rich dishes. She has no
appetite. The tonic n ay help that.
She has been living [*rincipa!ly on
m ilk . That’s all right for some people,
but not so good for others. I've
stopped it for the time. I ’ll talk
to you about her in a week or
two.”
Crosby was crisp, professional
and not communicative. His m a n ner
suggested preoccupation and an
undercurrent of perplexity. Hale
drove home in Bert's car with the
two patients. It was a shabby affair,
but good enougfi for the appalling
roads of the region. Both
patients avowed that they liked the
doctor.
"H e gives me confidence," Joan
testified. “ He asks fome odd questions,
though. I'd hate to be his
wife and try to have any secrets
from h im .”
The shabby car sank into a deep
rut and the occupants groaned.
“ I'm the only girl of my set
who hasn’t a car,” Joan said. “ That
■hows how economical I a m ," she
went on cheerfully. “ I have no
expensive tastes at all. God made
me the ideal bride for a young
m an struggling along on a small
Incom t. Think that over. R ex,” she
I sweetly. " I t ought to suggest
a lot of things to an intelligent mind
like yours.” *
"B y Jove, Hale, I believe she’s
proposing to you," Bert exclaimed,
with more interest than he had
shown since the discussion of the
new partnership.
“ Not yet. I'm thinking about it
and throwing out a few subtle
hints,” Jo a n explained.
“ Is this maidenly?” Bert asked.
He gave the wheel a whirl that
lifted Jo a n from her seat.
“ No. It isn't good driving, either.
I t ’s too soon for you to get jealous
of Rex. He won’t have me yet, at
any price. 1 can only live in hope."
Hale said nothing. Girls were inexplicable,
he was thinking. Here
was Joan Kneeland, making these
poor jokes in the presence of a
cousin who was still ill and in love
with her. It wasn’t like her. She
wasn't that type. No doubt she was
tensed up after her visit to the doctor.
Hale rode back to the Camp
in silence, hardly hearing the desultory
talk of his companions.
C H A P T E R IX
The next three weeks' life at H alcyon
C am p moved on almost as
serenely as Casper Kneeland had
once dreamed it would do. Under
the care of Doctor Crosby Bert
Kneeland was beginning to feel h im self
again. Joan, too, looked and apparently
felt better than before she
though never during the week-ends
when he m ight meet the elder Kneeland.
Finding himself alone with
the doctor one day before the others
had come downstairs Rex hinted
that Jo a n ’s progress was not as
rapid as he had hoped.
“ I ’ve no right to butt in—" he
admitted. “ Ju st the same—"
"J u s t the same you're in love with
the girl. You’re mighty anxious
about her, too, as well you may
be.”
Crosby spoke shortly. His cheerful,
sunburned face wore a look of
perplexity.
“ Just what do you mean by
tha t?” Rex spoke sharply. “ Why
should I be anxious?”
“ Because I'm anxious myself. Because
you’re perfectly right. The
girl is improving, but she isn't coming
up as fast as she should. Every
now and then, when I ’m feeling
most encouraged about her, she has
a set-back. I ’m beginning to think
I may have' been remiss. If we
had been in town I'd have had her
x-rayed before this. As it was, I
didn’t want to drag her to New
York in the heat, and there didn’t
seem any very good reason for it.”
They were alone on the porch.
The doctor had been lounging in
the big wicker chair. Now he sat
up and looked at Hale almost resentfully.
“ All her symptoms m ight mean
acute nervous indigestion, as I ’ve

had put herself into his hands. When
Hale pressed her for details of the
improvement she said briefly that
Doctor Crosby was very satisfactory,
and that she was following his
instructions. Rex was surprised,
therefore, when late one night, d uring
the third week of her treatment,
he saw Rose approaching the door
of Jo a n ’s room with a small tray in
her hand. He passed on; then on
an impulse, he stopped and retraced
his steps. He checked Rose as she
was about to enter the room.
"W h a t’s tha t?” he asked, looking
down at the tray.
“ Ju s t a little milk, sir.” Rose
was surprised by the question and
showed it. Her expression confused
the investigator. After all, what
right had he . . .
" I thought Miss Joan didn’t eat
anything between m eals,” he said,
less incisively than he had spoken
before. He was amazed by his own
persistence, and still more by his
resentment of th».t tray. It was a
nice little tray, holding nothing but
a napkin and a small thermos bottle.
“ She doesn't, u ju a lly ,” Rose admitted.
“ Only once in a while. Jane
said I was to bring this up because
she’ d idn't eat much dinner.”
Hale nodded and walked on to his
room. There seemed nothing more
he could do tonight. He would certainly
speak to Joan in the morning
about that milk.
It would not be easy. His relations
with Joan were becoming a
trifle strained. She alternately tormented
him, teased him, bullied
him , and was charm ing to him. That
was all right, of course, if it was
the way she wanted to act. But this,
too, did not seem like her. He took
refuge with Mrs. Spencer Forbes
and Bert, both of whom were very
friendly, and with Miss Hosanna,
who also surprised him >t times
She admitted that she was tired.
There were days when she wa* im patient,
almost snappish. He suspected
that all was not going
smoothly between her and Mrs.
Spencer Forbes. Mrs. Spencer
Forbes, he taw. was closely observing
Bert. At times, as she watched
him , her pale eyes held something
of the look Ainsworth's had so often
held when he was observing the humans
around h im —the look - of an
interested spectator following a
d ram a.
Crosby had formed the habit of
dropping into the C am p at tea time,
said,” he went on irritably. "The
general condition girls of today get
themselves into by the fool things
they do passes understanding. She
tells me she never went for much
cocktail drinking, but that last winter
she smoked a lot—twenty-flve
cigarettes or more a day, sometimes.
She admits that last winter,
too, she was going out every night
and getting along on flve or six
hours' sleep. She says she didn't
get to bed till three or four in the
morning, and that she was usually
awake by eight and couldn't go to
sleep again. All that would account
for the state she's in if she kept it
up. But she isn't doing that. She’s
leading a perfectly healthy, normal
life. She's dieting. She has all the
air and sunshine and exercise she
needs. With her natural constitution,
which is fine, she ought to be
forging ahead steadily—no*, up one
week and slipping back the next,
like the proverbial cat in the well.
She has me guessing. But she
swears she's taking her tonic and
following my instructions.”

“ Not about her diet,” Hex told
him. **She’s taking a milk nightcap
once in awhile. I caught her
at it one night thi* week and spoke
to her about it the next m orning."
“ What did she say?’1
“ Oh, that she had only done it a
few times when she was thirsty. She
likes milk, it seems. She had been
just about living on it this summer
till she went to you. She has been
brought up on the theory that milk
is the ideal food for us a ll."
“ She’s got to let me decide that,’*
Crosby said shortly. “ I ’ll speak to
her about it.”
He had no opportunity to do so
that day. Jo a n didn’t come down to
tea, and the doctor refused an invitation
to stay on for dinner. The
little conversation lingered in Hale's
mind, however, and when that night
he Sgain met Rose taking a thermos j
bottle to Jo a n ’s room he was ready |
for the encounter. Indeed, he was
more than ready. He was ruffled
and disturbed out of all proportion
to the incident. His eyes had the
reddish look they took on in anger.

He then packed the thermos bottle
with equal care. It would reveal a
choice collection of fingerprints—his
own, Rose’*, Jane's, and perhaps
others. But he now had in his
growing collection the fingerprints
of everyone in the house, just as he
had bottles and packing cases in
which to ship specimens for fingerprinting
or analysis. In a household
where so many happenings out of
the normal had occurred, it would
do no harm to take some precautions.
He grinned wryly as he took

and stripes have invaded the m illinery
world with great display. Hat
and bag sets of striking plaids or
stripes are among the fetching conceits
that tune to the enthusiasm
shown for high color.
Veilings galore are enlivening the
m illinery scene this spring. The
hat without a veil is the exception
rather than the rule. In arranging
veils you are supposed to do just as
fancy dictates, the more whimsical,
the more erratic, the more altogether
adorably irresponsible so far as
following form and conventions, the
smarter.
Navy is classic for spring suits,
coats and dresses. The navy blue
hat of chic peach-basket variety
shown below to the left in the picture
is topped off with a cluster of
soft pink ribbon bows nestled inside
the top of the crown. A sheer
navy veil is draped around the
crown with ends flying in the back.
This model is also available in other
fashionable color combinations.
Black hats with colorful accents
are an accepted mode for dressy
spring wear. The crown of the
black felt Wateau, shown above to
the right, is sprightly decked with
chartreuse and fuchsia flowers. The
big bow at the back is of stiff chartreuse
veiling.

Six-Hundred-Acre Island Forms From
Nucleus of Wreck of Big Sidewheeler
Brandywine island is about 17
miles up the Mississippi river from
Memphis, writes Joseph Curtis in
the Memphis Commercial Appeal.
Although it is on the Tennessee side
of the river, it belongs to Arkansas.
Off the foot of Brandywine lies Beef
island, or Islands 40 and 41. A small
chute separates them from Arkansas,
but the ground belongs to Tennessee.
At the northw'est point of
Brandywine is Centennial island on
the Arkansas side and joining it is
Island No. 37.
For many y e a n the main channel
in the Mississippi river ran on the
Tennessee side of Brandywine. Then
came Centennial cutoff, changing
the channel to the Arkansas side of
the island, and, finally almost joining
Islands 40 and 41 to the Arkansas
shore.
Brandywine chute often gets t o
low in summer that people walk
across it. However, during the high
water in the early part of 1937, a
current started down the chute
which widened it somewhat. River
men believe that eventually the
main channel will revert to its old
course.
Brandywine island was formed
over the hulk of the big sidewheel
steamer Brandywine, which burned
near the center of the island 106
years ago, resulting in the death of
155 persons. It began as Brandywine
Towhead, kept building up until
it now is an island ol about 600
acres.

The fussy “ combining jacket” that

by a trim rubber cape which
has many other uses besides keeping
stray hairs from settling on a

bureaus, boards, and commissions of
the executive branch of state government
and a reorganization of the
functions of those bureaus to avoid
duplication appears to be the key to
the Heil administration state government
reorganization program.
Last week bills proposing sweeping
reorganization changes were introduced
into the legislature by administion
leaders. One piesentd to the
assembly by Speaker Vernon Thompson,
Richland Center Republican, j
would abolish the present tax commission
and create a new department of
taxation headed by an $8,000 a yeai
commissioner.
Another presented to the senate by j
Senator Roethe, Fennimore Republi-i
can, would abolish the present threeman
highway commission and replace
it with a $6,000 a year state highway j
commissioner.
Still another offered by the senate)
committee on taxation and corpora-1
tions would create a new state motor*
vehicle division to take over the func-|
tions of six state departments and to
be headed by a $6,000 a year commissioner.
A fourth bill proposes to abolish
the present three man rule of the
state public service commission andj
replace it with a single commissioner!
control. A new education department I
would take over the combined duties j
of the state department of public instruction.
the board of regents, the!
normal school and the mining school*
board.
Opponents of the administration I
are fearful that the Republicans are
attempting to reorganize the state;
government in order to place as many j
of their own party in state jobs as is
possible. Administration leaders point
out that only through a complete reorganization
is any economy is any
economy in state government feasible, i

How to Satiafy the Dictators
Long, long ago there lived a man
renowned for his tremendous strength
He was, in fact, able to rout an army
single-handed, but he was no match
for a wiley woman who “got into his
hair." I refer to Sampson and his
seductive Delilah.
Long, long ago there lived two men
— Caesar and Mark Antony. They
both fell victim to the charms of one
woman. So fascinating was she that
she has gone down ;n history as the
embodiment of personal charm. You
have it. She was C4eopatra. To her
an unknown bard has paid this tribute:
Had Cleopatra’s charming nose
Been but a trifle longer;
Or just a trifle shorter — say
A half an inch or quarter
Enough to mar the beauty
O f those fascinating features
Which made some very wise men
Act like very silly creatures.
There’s not so much in great events
As history supposes;
But there’s a great deal dependent
On the length of women’s noses.
Now I ’ve been thinking —
I f H itler got a Delilah
As a birthday present rare.
She might succeed in charming him
And “get into his hair.”
She wouldn’t need to shave his head
As Delilah did her man’s
If she could only tame down his
Territorial demands.
And if from Ethiopia or any other
clime f
Another Cleopatra’d up and exercise
her charm
To vamp great Mussolini —
Far from doing any harm
She’d be a boon to all the world
And dispel this war alarm.
For as long as Mussolini had a

pa; tor of the M. E. church, read the
ceremony at 6 o'clock. Miss Helen
Adamski, of Detroit, played the bridal
chorus from Lohengrin. Mrs. Hulen J
was the only other guest to witness
the ceremony. The bride wore a lig h t ;
blue wuolen suit with spring wine
accersories and a shoulder corsage of
sweet ptas. gardenias and forget-menots.
Mrs. West’s frock was of black
and white dotted voile and her corsage
was of sweet peas. A dinner was
served to the same group later at the
West home which was decorated with
many Easter lilies and spring flowers.
After a trip to Chicago the young
couple returned to' Eland to reside,
where the bride is primary teacher in
the Eland state graded school.

TN ANCIENT times, Halloween, or
• th e Vigil of Saman, the god of
death, fell on the thirty-first of October.
On this night, Sam an was
supposed to call together the souls
condemned during the past year and
assign them to the bodies of animals.
It was a time of fear and
apprehension and the pagans wore
hideous masks and lighted bonfires
to keep away the ghosts and witches
which were supposed to wander the
earth freely on this night. At the
advent of Christianity, it became
the Vigil of All Saints day and lost
its bogey meaning but the custom
of celebrating the night in a m a cabre
manner still persists.

TRUTH about ADVERTISING
By CHARLES B. ROTH
ENTERPRISE WANT
AD DEPARTMENT
H IG H PRESSURE
A SALESMAN, 10 years ago unscrupulous
but successful,
came in to see me today with his
troubles. He no longer makes sales.
I asked him what he thought was
the matter.
“ That’s just it,” said he. “ I don’t
know. I give ’em the works—but
they don’t buy.”
This man is a salesman of the
old school— a worshipper at the
shrine of high pressure
salesmanship.
His methods no longer
make sales. He
thinks he’s losing his
grip.
That is not the
trouble. The truth is
that high-pressure
salesmanship is out,
is dead, is obsolete.
Is without power to
make sales in these
days of greater education.
People haven’t changed, but they
have become better educated in the
higher education of taking care of
themselves and their money. The
process which brought about this
education is newspaper advertising.
It used to be possible for a glib
talker to take almost anything out
to sell, no matter how’ worthless
or inferior, and by sheer high-pressure
selling to “ clean up.” But not
now.
Even the lowliest buyer knows
that certain claims are untrue, and
that the price asked for certain
Charles Roth
SALESMANSHIP
items is excessive. These things he
knows because advertising, his
refuge against false claims, told him
so.
The average customer today is
much better informed than even
professional buyers were 20 years
ago.
The housewife knows which foods
contain vitamins, which contain
vegetable oils, which contain expensive
ingredients and the like. She
knows the efTect of this or that product.
She is never, therefore, ai the
mercy of the high-pressure artist
who seeks to rob her by giving her
less than others and charging her
more for it.
Advertising ,in the newspapers,
which she consults regularly, has
built into her life an expert knowl
edge of values and prices and qualities.
These make her an extraordi
narily well informed person.
He who would sell the average
customer must come with good val
ue, a fair price and high quality
Otherwise he won’t get even a hear
ing, because we have something
now with which to compare un
known or new goods—and we are
quick to reject those that do noi
measure up.
Much more than a selling aid foi
business is advertising, it is ar
educational system which is making
Americans the best educated buyers
in the world. It is an economic sys
tem which is giving American;
more for their money every t.ay.

By C. HOUSTON GOUDISS
BEGINNING around the twelfth year in girls and the thirteenth
year in boys, the rate of growth is greatly accelerated.
Then children require large quantities of food to
meet the needs of their rapidly maturing bodies and they
usually develop huge appetites. Unfortunately, however,
they are often inclined to overlook the foods that are most
necessary to health, to eat at odd hours, and to stuff themselves
with rich combinations*
that may severely tax the
digestive system.
Mothers may find it exceed-
She—How can any one exist without

ingly difficult to deal with
j their offspring all through the
'teens, when physiological
changes are taking place
which mark the transition
from childhood to maturity.
1 For along with the development of
I his fast growing body, the child's
I emotional life undergoes
a profound
and disturbing
change. The
boy or girl who
was formerly am enable
to direction
suddenly exhibits a
desire for independence.
He becomes
jum p y and
irritable, and the
wish to direct his
own life extends
even to his chcice of food.
Mothers m ust mobilise all the
patience and forbearance at their
com m and—m ust make it their solemn
duty to see that their adolescent
children have the foods
they require for growth, for stam ina,
and for building resistance to
disease. F or the stress and strain
of adolescence will be far more
easily weathered by boys and girls
who are properly nourished.
Quality Important as Quantity
During the years of greatest
growth, boys and girls frequently
require more food than their fathers
or mothers. But it is essential
that the diet be well balanced
and of the highest nutritive
value. It should include an abundance
of easily digested energy
foods, such as breadstuffs, potatoes,
cereals and macaroni prodj
ucts, as well as liberal c,uantities
of the more concentrated fuel
foods, such as butter or margarine.
There m ust be an ample
supply of high quality protein—
which is furnished by meat, fish,
eggs, cheese and m ilk—to build
the new muscle tissue required to
cover the lengthening frames of
the boys and help build the round
ed contours of the girls.
Need for Minerals and Vitamins
There m ust be ample amounts
of the various minerals—especially
calcium and phosphorus for the
teeth and bones, and to help build
sound, healthy nerves; iodine for
proper functioning of the thyroid
gland; iron for building increased
quantities of rich red blood. Every
vitam in must be included in the
adolescent's diet to promote norm
a l health and development, but
vitam in A is especially valuable
at this tim e ot rapid growth, and
vitam in B is also required in liberal
amounts to meet the extra demands
of increased activity and
growth.
A Quart of Milk Dally
It is highly desirable that the
diet should include a q uart of milk
daily, because m ilk is such a
splendid source of calcium and
vitam in A, as well as other necessary
minerals and vitamins, if
children have been brought up
with a wholesome rcspect for this
master food, they will continue to
drink it during their ’teens.
However, if they complain about
taking it as a beverage, mothers
should see that it is supplied by
way of cream soups and sauces,
with cereals, and in nutritious pudding
desserts, which can be enriched
with eggs, thus providing
additional proteins, minerals and
vitamins.
Fruits and Vegetables
Fruits should be eaten freely—
at least twice a d ay—and the highcaloric
dried fruits, such as prunes
and dates, may be used to advantage
along with bananas, oranges,
grapefruit, apples and other
fresh fruits, as well as the
m any varieties that come in cans.
Cooked and raw vegetables
should be provided liberally—if
possible, at both lunch and dinner.
Dressing cooked vegetables with
butter or m argarine will increase
j their fuel value, and make them
more satisfying for hungry boys.
Girls, who are often finicky eaters
during their adolescent years, can
usually be tempted with crisp, raw
vegetables served in the form of
salads; and protein ran be added
by means ot eggs, cheese, fish or
chicken.
Boys Need More Food Than Girls
There is a marked differencr. between
the fuel requirements of
'teen age boys and girls. Both
must have a well balanced diet.
But the boys need many more
I calories, and therefore should
have a more generous allowance
j f highly concentrated foods which
supply necessary fuel with a min-
; m um tax on the digestive system.
! They should have cereals in sen-
I erous-size portions—and it's advisable
to choose part of the cereals
from those retaining the bran and
the germ. And they'll welcome
nourishing desserts, such as custard,
tapioca, bread and cornstarch
puddings.
Girls Warned Against Reducing
Girls, on the other band, may
become fussy and try to cut down
radically on the fuel foods, with
the foolish idea of keeping fashionably
thin. This must not be
permitted, because it may result
in under-nutrition, which opens the
way to fatigue and nervousness,
and may lead to serious disease.
In addition to wholesome, nourishing'
food, 'teen age boys and
girls should have plenty of rest,
sunshine and healthful outdoor exercise.
And they also deserve the
sympathy and deep understanding
of their parents.
Questions Answered
Mrs. S. B. L .—Sea foods are a
rich source of iodine, fresh and
canned salmon, cod, crabmeat and
oysters being especially notable in
this respect. Fruits and vegetables
grown near the sea also contain
varying amounts, depending
upon the iodine content of the water
and soil.

Care in Transplanting
T R A N S P L A N T IN G is an impor-
* tant activity in almost every
garden, but a gardener will save
time and possible disappointment
if he knows what should and what
should not be transplanted.
The following should not be
moved: Celosia, didiscus (blue
lace flower), four o’clock, hunnem
ania, and perennial sweet pea.
Because of their peculiar root
growth, these flowers are d am aged.
sometimes even killed, when
transplanted.
Flowers which m ay be transplanted
with little fear of d am age,
as long as the moving is done
properly, include agcratum, alyssum,
snapdragon, aster, calendula,
marigold, pansy, petunia,
pinks, salvia, scabiosa, verbena,
Canterbury bells, columbine, hollyhock,
pyrethrum and viola.
There is a third division of flowers,
according to H arry A. Joy,
flower expert of the Ferry Seed
Breeding Station, whose lives will
not be endangered by transplanting,
but whose growth will be
stunted. Both plant and blossoms
will be smaller but earlier. Larkspur,
zinnia, phlox, nasturtium
and bachelor button are in thi*
group.

ADVENTURERS’ CLUB
H I A D L I N E S F R OM THK L I V E S
O F P E O P L E L I K E Y O U R S E L F !
“ R a i l s o f D e a t h ”
H e l l o , e v e r y b o d y :
Well, sir, for a long time I ’ve been warning young fellows
to stay off of side door pullmans. I ’ve seen so many adventure
yarns about lads who have come to grief beating their way on
freight trains that I ’m pretty well convinced it’s a dangerous
pastime. But here’s a lad I can’t very well warn to stop riding
freight trains. In the first place, that was his job. In the second
place, he’s reformed and isn’t working on the railroad any
more. And in the third place, he knows all about the hazards
of railroading. He probably knows a doggone sight more about
it than I do.
If those aren’t enough reasons, I could probably think up
some more. But here comes today’s distinguished adventurer,
Edwin F. Eckdahl of Young, Saskatchewan, Canada—another
fellow who has come a long, long way to join our club. And
here’s the story:
Ed started railroad work in the early part of the century,
braking on the Pennsylvania. His run was out of Logansport,
Ind., and-those were the days when the men had to
contend with the old style link-and-pin drawbar and when
air brakes were few and far between. There might be a few air-braked
cars on every train, but most freights consisted principally of "ja c k s ”
or hand-braked cars.
E d says every brakeman tried to get a few air-braked cars
np at the head of the train, where they'd help a lot in holding
back the other cars, but some of the old die hard conductors
wouldn’t allow that. "There are brakes on top.” they used to
say, “ and the brakeman is getting paid for braking them . Let
him work for his money.” It was one of those conductors that
E d was working for—and it came near costing him his life.
Tops of Cars Covered With Thin Ice.
It was one day early in 1906 that that happened. Ed's train pulleo

m e at and merchandise. "We had a nice string of air-braked cars,” he
Bays, "b u t there were behind about ten or twelve ‘jacks' and the conductor
said ‘nothing doing’ when the rear-end man and I wanted to
switch them. It had rained in Chicago and the tops of the cars were
covered with a coating of thin ice, and my flrst job was to go over the
tops and chip that ice from the running boards on the ten or twelve cars
I was to use for b raking."
E d had ice clips on his shoes to keep him from slipping.
They were pretty dull, but he thought they'd last h im one more
trip. He worked his way along until he was about ten cars back
of the engine and then, near the I. C. crossing at Riverdale, the
train hit a slight curve. Ed was unprepared for it. He lost his
balance and was forced to step off the flat running board onto
the sloping, ice-covered top of the car.
The instant he did his feet shot out from under him. He started sliding
off the top. " I was on my back,” he says, “ but when m y legs were
over the side I managed to turn over on my stomach—and, as luck would
have it, a nail that had worked up from a board in the car top caught
in my coat. I was so far over the side that there was more of me in
the open than on the roof. I was ju st able to keep part of my chest
and arm s on the car. And there I hung.
“ I knew if I slid off I wouldn’t have much of a chance. All I could
do was hang on—and get back on top if that was possible. It was cold
weather and the position I was m was tiring me out. The longer I
stayed there the worse it would be.”
His Hands Slipped on the Smooth Ice.
E d knew he couldn’t look for any help. The engineer would think
he was in the caboose and the conductor would think he was in the
engine. His lantern had shattered and gone over the side when he fell
and he couldn't signal with that. He tried pulling himself forward with
the flat of his hands against the car top, but they slipped on the smooth
ice.
“ I tell you it kept me busy,” he says. " I did n 't know how long that
nail would hold me, or how long the cloth of my coat would stand the
strain. B ut believe me, I stuck tight with all the strength I had.”
But now Ed noticed something that was working in ~his favor. The
heat of his palm s as they pressed against the top of the car was melting
the thin coating of ice. In one spot his hands were beginning to take
hold. He began to move his palms forward to melt the ice up ahead.
It was a long, slow process. "B y wriggling my body as a snake
would,” he says, " I was able to bring it forward a little. I had to melt
quite a bit of ice to get myself in a fairly safe position and even then
the wind and the swaying of the car threatened to throw me off at any
minute. And then I ran into another obstruction.”
The N ail Holds H im Back F rom Safety.
It was that nail which had caught in his clothing. In the beginning
it had saved his life. Now it was holding him back, keeping him from
moving any farther forward. Ed d idn’t dare move a hand to free it.
And there he was, fastened to the car, unable to move any farther and
not knowing when a low spot or a curve in the track would shake
him off.
He began to get a bit panic-stricken then. He clawed at the top of
the car with futile hands. And suddenly his groping palms struck on
another na il worked up out of the boards like the first one.
" I caught hold of it by a thum b and finger,” Ed says, “ and only
then did I dare to move the other hand down and loosen the nail that
was caught in my coat. I wriggled back on the top and when I reached
the running board I was covered with sweat and my hands and face
were full of slivers. All I did was lie flat on my face and pant."
The train was pulling into a station and the engineer whistled for
brakes, but Ed did n 't move. “ Of course the train ran past the station,”
E d says, "a n d I was in line for a bawling out. But when I told the engineer
what had happened he had to make his excuses for not seeing my
lantern disappear. I've had lots of close calls in railroading, but tha>
was m y closest one."

First U. S. Post Office Was Located in Boston in 1641
The flrst postal establishment on
the North American continent was
located in Boston in 1641 in the tavern
of Richard Fairbanks who was
given authority to charge one penny
for each letter delivered, Prof.
R. Del French of McGill university
told members of the Rotary club
of Montreal, says the Christian Science
Monitor. In Canada, the first
record of postal service wa* during
the French regime when a road was
opened between Quebec and Montreal
more than 200 years ago.
Private dispatches by m ail in Canada
were delivered on schedule only
after the fall of Quebec into British
hands. This marked the final real
attempt to organize a postal service
on a regular basis, and Benjamin
Franklin was instrumental in developing
this work between Montreal
and New York by way of the C hamplain
and Hudson route Postal service
was instituted between Halifax
! and Liverpool in 1755.
Gabriel Arthur, Wanderer
I N THE spring of 1673, Capt. Abra-
* h am Wood of Fort Henry (now
Petersburg) in Virginia sent Jam es
Needham, a South Carolina gentlem
an , and a lad named Gabriel Arthu
r into the Southern Appalachians
to trade with the Cherokees. They
were warmly welcomed but later
Needham was murdered by a treacherous
Occaneechi brave.
The Cherokee chief promised
A rthur to escort him home the following
spring. In the meantime he
took Arthur to a village of friendly
Mohetons on the banks of the Great
Kanawha. Returning from this visit
the Cherokees went out of their way I
to attack a village of Shawnees. In j
the battle which followed the Eng- |
lish lad was wounded twice by ar- I
rows and taken prisoner by the [
Shawnees.
Because he had long hair, the
Shawnees suspected that their cap- ;
tive was not a Cherokee and when ]
they scoured off the accumulated j
d irt they were amazed at his white j
skin. When he told them, by sign j
talk, that he would return to trade
with them if they would release
him , they promptly sent h im on his
way to the Cherokee country.
R eaching the town of his former
friends, he set out for Fort Henry
the following spring accompanied by
18 Cherokee laden with furs for trading.
Narrowly escaping death at the
hands of the hostile Occaneechies,
A rthur reached his home after one
of the most eventful experiences that
probably ever befell an English lad
of his years. He had penetrated farther
into the Ohio country than any
of his fellow-Englishmen but history
does not record whether or not he
lived to see his people triumph over
the French in their contest for that
rich land.

America’s ‘Prime Minister’
I N 1736, Christian Priber arrived
in the Cherokee Indian village of
Great Tellico in what is now east
Tennessee. He had left in South
Carolina everything he owned except
some books and writing m a terials.
Priber soon won the friendship of
the Indians by adopting their dress
and mode of living and insured their
further confidence by marrying the
daughter of Moytoy, chief of the
tribe. Then, as one of their own,
he taught the redskins to read and
write.
Having won their deep respect
and encouraged their dependence
upon his plans, he staged an im pressive
ceremony. While war
drums thumped, he, the mild-mannered
teacher, short in stature, unimpressive
i n a p p e a r a n c e ,
"crow ned" the tall and stately Moytoy
" E m p e ro u r" of the “ Kingdom
of Paradise.” Diplomatically, he
created other titles for the lesser
chiefs and there was a colorful ceremony
es they paraded before the
throne of their "em p e ro ur." But,
most im portant of all, was Christian
P rib e rs own appointment a?
"p rim e minister.”
His next step was his undoing. He
sent an "official” communication
from Great Tellico, capital of the
Cherokee "k in g d om ,” to the governor
at Charleston telling h im that
the English must leave America.
Not because they took h im seriously,
but because they feared French
influence, the English m ilitary authorities
captured America's only
"p rim e m iniste r” and kept h im prisoner
in Frederica, Ga., until he
died.

Schermerhoom’s Ride
Ll*ten my reader and you shall learn
O l the midnight ride o l Schermerhoora.
D A U L R E V E R E didn't have such
* a hard time of it in April, 1775,
when he rode 15 miles on the best
turnpikes in the colonies to be the
inspiration for Longfellow's famous
poem. But when Symon Schermerhoorn,
on the night of February 8,
1690, rode from Schenectady, N. Y.,
to Fort Orange (A lbany), he made
the most courageous ride in American
history.
Symon was in the village of Schenectady
on the night it was destroyed
by the French and Indians.
He knew that the small garrison of
24 men could not resist very long
and that the attackers, flushed by
victory, probably would go on to
Fort Orange for more plunder.
It was bitter cold and the snow
was coming thick and fast. Although
wounded in the thigh, he seized ■
stray horse and started the 20-mile
ride of warning. Schermerhoorn
rode for six hours plunging through
drifts that were impassable ■ few
hours later. In spite of his wound
and the severe weather and the fact
that he passed many farm houses
where others could have taken over
his mission, he kept courageously on
until he reached Fort Orange. In
front of the gates, gasping warning,
he collapsed.
The severe conditions under which
he made his ride are shown by the
fact that the French and Indians
were unable to continue their foray
and were forced to return to
Canada.

O F F E R IN G THE P R O O F
The Woodhull Dispatch tells of a
real estate man who was showing a
prospective tenant a house, and the
would-be renter said: “ You say that
this house has been occupied all
along, but most of the windows are
broken. How does that happen?”
Said the real estate m an: “ Well,
you see, my partner is very enthusiastic,
and every time he shows a
customer he insists on proving tc
h im that it is only a stone’s throw
from the railroad station."
Very Good
A lady entered a trolley, and a
gentleman promptly got up and offered
het his seat.
“ You’re a jewel,” said the lady,
gratefully.
“ No, miss,” replied the gentleman,
gallantly, “ I'm a jeweler; for
haven’t I just set the jewel?”

Scarcity of Honor

less; its result generally defeat and
disgrace. Let’s have more honesty,
more brains, more guts!
The present social, political, and
economic plight of the entire world is
a sorry tribute to both the intelligence
and integrity of business and political
leadership in the post-war period.
Europe and Asia are today in convulsions
that may be fatal because their
leaders 20 years ago ignored history
and considered promises as convenient
scraps of paper. Courage and honesty
have been conspicuously absent during
the crises of the past year.
Pledges are given in two-tongued
language, to mean one thing at home
and something else abroad, and diplomats
remember the ancient German
cynic who said that only children and
fools tell the truth.

With this country’s immense expenditures
for education, there seems
little reason why honesty in public
places should be coupled with mediocrity.
There seems no reason why
public office should attract only the
clever and impecunious, who see their
term principally as a means of making
by betrayal the fortune that they
cannot assemble by honest exercise
of their brains. We see no solid foundation
under the fears of public men
that they must sacrifice their convictions
to the cries of a noisy m inority!
or to the guns of a Dutch Schultz or
Al Capone. The event always proves j
that the sacrifice was weak and need-
All feminine readers will agree that
the woman in W’ittenberg who drives

worse than the man who cooks from
