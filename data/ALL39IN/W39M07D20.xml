Governor Heil Explains Highway
Contract Signature**
During the past month Governor
Heil has been criticized for his failure
to sign highway construction contracts
already approved by the highway
commission and let out to contractors.
Work on highway construction cannot
begin until the Governor officially
signs the contracts.
This week in a letter to L. B.
Emerich, chairman of Lincoln county
board Governor Heil explains that his
action in withholding the contracts
was not prompted by political desires
as so charged by administration opponents.
The tax measure just passed
by the assembly originally provided
for the diversion of highway funds to
help balance the budget. U ntil the
question of diversion was settled the
contracts were withheld in order to
assure sufficient funds, according to
the Governor’s letter. (The provision
for diverting 7H millions of highway
funds was stricken from the tax
measure by an amendment.)
Two days before the release of the
letter to the Lincoln county board
chairman by the Governor, Senator
Fred P. Risser, Madison Progressive,
had asked for an investigation of the
handing of highway funds by the
present administration. Senator Risser
charged in a resolution asking for
the probe, that the administration was
“deliberately withholding contracts in
an effort to coerce senators into doing
his bidding on important legislation.”
Risser’s resolution asking that a
joint senate-assembly committee investigate,
claimed that nearly two
million dollars worth of highway contracts
were being held up by the Governor.
The resolution was not acted
upon by the senate.
According to the Governor’s letter,
he is now in a position to sign highway
contracts conscientiously because
he now knows there will Ik* money to
pay for them.
U. W. Fees Raised
University of Wisconsin students
will pay $10 a year more in fees under
the 11)39-40 budget adopted by the
board of regents. The fee increase is
expected to raise about $100,000 to
help offset the cut in the university’s
appropriation by the legislature.
While the board said, “we are opposed
in principle to increase of student
fees as a means of taking care of
operating expenses,” it felt the in
crease was more desirable than cutting
teachers* salaries, which “ still reflect
a considerable part of the cut imposed
during the depression.” It was
pointed out that salaries are still lower
than those at other universities,
and that further (tits would “ do irreparable
harm to tne morale of thc
staff and would seriously injure the
university for many years to come.”
Oleo Hearing
The assembly hearing on a bill
which would repeal Wisconsin’s controversial
tax on oleomargarine drew
a resident of Alabama who told the
committee that the tax has not increased
the consumption or price of
butter and that it is giving Wisconsin
much unfavorable advertising.
The Southerner was B. J. Goode,
representing the Association of Southern
Commissioners of Agriculture,
who added that because of the wide
price difference between oleo and butter
there was no real competition between
the two. He said continuance
of the tax would drive southern farm ers
into the dairy business in competition
with Wisconsin.
Others appearing against the oleo
tax were Assemblyman Henry Berquist
and former assemblyman S. J.
Gwidt, both of Rhinelander, who declared
paper manufacturers were losing
orders from southern states because
of ill feeling against the tax;
and D. J. McNalley, of the Milwaukee
Association of commerce, who said
many manufacturers opposed the tax.
Proponents of the tax said there
should be no retaliation against Wisconsin
because of the tax, because
state farmers buy large quantities of
cottonseed oil, from which oleomargarine
is made, for cattle feed; and
because dairying is Wisconsin’s major
industry and needs protection, while
cottonseed oil is only a by-product of
the south’s major cotton industry.
$1.00 Fishing Fee
All Wisconsin male fishermen over
18 years of age will be required to get
a $1.00 fishing license regardless of
whether they fish with an ordinary
pole, a rod and reel, or only a drop
line and hook, is a bill passed by the
assembly and sent on to the senate for
concurrence. Women are exempt from
the provisions of the measure, unless
they use rod and reel.
Present laws require the license
only for resident rod and reel fishermen.
It is estimated that the new bill
would raise $150,000 yearly.
The bill, however, if finally passed,
will allow county clerks to issue licenses
without charge if the fisherman
files a statement that he is unable to
pay the $1.00 fee.
Assembly Tax Bill
The Heil administration’s tax bill
which has had many revisions, with
sales tax and non-essentials tax proposals,
highway money diversion suggestions,
and what not, has finally
passed the assembly. But the bill as
approved by the lower house still is
short some 8 ^ million dollars of
meeting state budget expenses for the
coming biennium.
There is no general sales tax in the
bill and there is not to be any diverting
of highway funds for budget balancing.
The original bill called for the
use of 7Mi million of highway money,
but an amendment by Assemblyman
Gruszka of Mosinee, adopted 92-1, has
struck the diversion provisions from
the bill. The single vote was cast by
Assemblyman Rath of Antigo.
Republicans succeeded in killing off
many amendments to the bill and had
most of their difficulty with one which
proposed to eliminate the two cents
per package cigarette tax. By a narrow
margin of 10 votes the cigarette
tax remained in the bill.
The bill as passed by the assembly

L
A short distance north of Hghway
29 on County Trunk Q, about three
miles northeast of Wittenberg, will be
the scene of many surprises this coming
Sunday, when the Shawano county
game farm and rearing pond will be
opened to the public.
Surprises will be plentiful, because
the visitors will see one of the finest
conservation farms in the state, including
the state game farm at Poynette,
says the Shawano Evening
Leader.
Walter Netzel and Grover Meisner,
both residents of Wittenberg and active
workers in the cause of conservation,
have watched the project grow
from a hole in the woods to a cluster
of fine buildings, game pens, and rearing
ponds. Being thoroughly familiar
with the history of the game farm, the
two Wittenberg men were consulted
for the information herein.
Five thousand pheasants will be
turned loose later in the year for the
hunters to prey on this fall. Remember,
boys, if it wasn’t for the conservation
club, pheasants in this part of
the country would be as rare as a dodo
bird. The springers are growing fast
and will weigh two and three pounds
when they are turned loose in a few
weeks. They were grown from day
old chicks supplied by the state conservation
department.
Trout fishermen, too. can thank
their lucky stars for the fish and game
club. Imagine, 60,000 fingerlings are
rapidly approaching the state of being
when they will be released in Shawano
county streams. Next year or so some
of them will be big enough to be lured
by flics and angleworms.
The game farm and rearing pond
was started two years ago when a
WPA project was approved. The
buildings, pens, and rearing ponds
were built by crews of men varying
from 20 to 00 and part of the costs
were carried by the federal povernmtnt.
Remember— -part of the costs.
The conservation club does not own
a gold mine, and they haven’t a key to
the back door of the mint. The money
must come from somewhere. There
are tw*o possible sources of revenue—
one very important and the other negligible.
Dues paid by the members barely
pay operating expenses, because the
fees are low enough to enable everybody
making more than $3 a week to
belong. Almost anyone can stand a
rap of $1 a year.
The only other important source of
cash is the annual conservation jam boree.
Most of the money taken in at
the event the last two years has been
stuck in the game farm and rearing
ponds. It is necessary that the jam boree
receive wholehearted support
from everybody, as it means eventual
life or death of conservation.
The more visitors who come out to
the farm next Sunday, the more there
will be who will realize the fine work
the organization has been doing.
The annual fish and game jamboree
is coming off a week from Sunday at
the Shawano county fair grounds.
Lend a hand wherever possible, because
conservation work is a thankless
job at best. Most men like to hunt,
but they give little consideration to
the work of populating the county
with pheasants. The same goes for
trout fishermen.
Mark two events on your calendar
and break a leg rather than miss
either one of them. First— Sunday,
July 23—visitors day at the game
farm. Second— the fish and game
jamboree at Shawano Saturday and
Sunday, Ju ly 29 and 30.

HOUSING:
Political Vo/cue?
Periodically there arises a David
who slays the wicked giant Goliath.
Usually it sets a fashion until corruptness
again catches hold. Last
year New York's racket-busting
States Attorney Thomas E. Dewey
became a David, captured public
fancy, inspired radio programs and
placed wicked politicians on the defensive.
The public obviously wanted
reform and no more rackets.
When Tom Dewey began looming
as a 1940 G. O. P. presidential possibility,
reformation sounded like
good strategy for any aspiring politician
or party. By early Ju ly , Attorney
General Frank Murphy had
behind h im an excellent record of
smashing corrupt political machines
(like Kansas City's Tom Pendergast)
and tracking down income tax
RA CK ET B IS T E R D EW E T
Everybody’* doing ii.
•vaders. This was the signal for
Scripps-Howard Columnist Raymond
Clapper to charge that F rank M urphy
was trying too hard to win the
yice presidential nomination.
Meanwhile there was arising another
administration racket-busting
program under guidance of the justice
department's T hurman W. Arnold.
Its aim : To drive trust practices,
price-fixing and collusion out
c f the U. S. building industry. The
day Mr. Arnold told his p la n i to
the temporary national economic
committee, Chicago Daily News’
W illiam H. Fort wrote from Washington
that this was "obviously the
New Deal's most ambitious trustbusting
venture in its attempt to
push young Tom Dewey’s New York
activities into the shade.”
Designing or not, T hurman Arnold's
drive bids fair to accomplish
•omething. With 140 lawyers and

JAPAN :
TV'o Fooling
Two years ago this month the men
c f Nippon invaded China, stormed
Peking and started the war which
• t ill remains officially undeclared.
Anniversary time finds Ja p a n at her
w it’s end economically, enjoying an
artificial wartime boom but nevertheless
ready to impose new taxes
and new restrictions on an already
aorely pressed people. How much
longer the conflict will last is anybody's
guess, but certain it is that
C h in a grows more unified each day
and will be a thorn in Tokyo’s side
tor years to come.
What troubles Japan today more
tha n her Chinese problem is a second
war, which international observers
agree is now an actuality.
The opponents: Ja p a n and Russia.
The participants: Japs and their
puppet Manchukuoans versus Russians
and their puppet Outer Mongolians.
For five years both nations have
kept their troubles out of print by
relying on convenient buffer states,
but by early June there were signs
of open hatred. Newspapers, first
in Tokyo, then in Moscow, began
boasting of incredible victories
which never gibed with the enemy
account. After several weeks of this,
American correspondents finally
reached the Japanese front lines
from where they dispatched more
accurate reports, yet there was
enough Japanese good news in them
to indicate official censorship. Most
important, correspondents found
well-equipped armies fighting on a
nine-mile front in a region so remote
from civilization that it might
be on another planet.
At Tokyo, Premier Baron Kiichiro
H iranum a officially discounted the
importance of this warfare, but he
was fooling no one. Knowing so, he
made it clear Japan will show ‘‘a
stronger front” to the Soviet on
questions of fishing, coal and oil
concessions.
EUROPE:

In June Yugo-Slavia's regent,
Prince P aul, visited Berlin. In early

Gen. Henry Werth, attended Germ

was discussing "the general
situation as well as specific German-
Bulgarian questions" in Berlin
with Adolf Hitler.
As well it might, this frightened
R um ania. Reason: Adolf Hitler's
three guests represented nations
surrounding R um an ia on as many
sides, south, west and north. A
second reason: Adolf Hitler is angry
with King Carol for consorting with
England and France. A third reason
: F rom these visits m ay grow an

POLITICS:
Explanation
Ever since Chicago’s Democratic
convention of 1932, In dian a’s presidential
aspirant and former Gov.
Paul V. McNutt has been at odds
with National C hairm an James A.
Farley. Reason: Democrat McNutt
allegedly tried to block Franklin
Roosevelt’s nomination in 1932. Thus
when the white-haired Hoosier returned
from his Philippine governorgeneralship
last month to start his
presidential boom, he found no welcome
at national headquarters. But
a few weeks later he emerged from
conference with Mr. Farley and political
wiseacres smiled, for a feud
based on misunderstanding had evidently
been settled. The reported
feud:
Since early days Illinois and Indiana
Democrats have worked together,

. . . Polls are very annoying
to New Dealers; they
want an investigation . . .
Recent opposition to some of
the President’s fiolicies indicates
that congress has got
hack to normal.
BU LG A R IA 'S CLAIM
Yugo-Slaiia would also suffer.
Hungary, opposing the pro-democracy
bloc composed of R um ania,
Greece arfli Turkey.
Greatest reason, however, was
Germany’s apparent support of Bulgaria’s
long-standing territorial
claim to Dobruja, which she lost to
Rum ania after the World war (see
map). Should enough Rome-Berlin
axis pressure for return of this territory
be placed against R um ania,
Adolf Hitler evidently presumes
King Carol m igh t be persuaded to
drop his Anglo-French connections.
Biggest fallacy in Germ any’s plan
for a pro-axis Balkan bloc is that
the Reich m ust support two nations
which want the same thing. Yugoslavia,
though leaning axis-wise,
could hardly be persuaded to ally
with Bulgaria if it meant surrender
of the land she gained from that
nation after the great war.
SCIENCE:
Official Car ,
Within the antarctic circle lie vast
iron, coal and oil resources coveted
not only by the U. S. but by Norway,
Germany and Great Britain. In previous
trips to that region Rear Adm.
Richard E. Byrd staked out vast
areas for the U. S., but no official
claim was ever made. Several
weeks ago congress appropriated
I $340,000 for a land-staking expedi-
, tion which Explorer Byrd will lead
I out of New York early next October,
hoping to claim approximately 675,-
000 square miles of antarctic wastes.
Equipment will include three
ships, the coast guard's Northland,
A dm iral Byrd's Bear of Oakland,
and the ice breaker North Star. Also
taken will be ample air equipment,
but what fascinates most landlubbers
is the "house on wheels."
Since wide crevasses in the ice
crust offer a mighty obstacle to explorers,
ordinary tractors are useless.
At Chicago, therefore, Dr.
Thomas E. Poulter announced he
was building a huge new snow cruiser
55 feet long, powered by diesel
engines nnd tracked with endless
tread wheels. In its spacious quarters
four men can live comfortably
with supplies to last a year. On its
roof will be lashed a small airplane.
C ANDIDATE McNl'TT
Mr. Varley n o u ’ understands.
candidate to another as occasion demanded.
In 1932 the Chicago convention
went into wee morning hours
with Franklin Roosevelt still minus
his two-thirds vote. As host, Chicago's
Mayor Anton Cermak approached
Indiana's Bosses McNutt
and Frank McHale, got their agreement
and planned to announce d ramatically
during the next vote that
Indiana and Illinois were switching
to Roosevelt.
But Chicago was also planning a
world’s fair one year hence. With
nomination unlikely for two more
ballots, Mayor Cermak moved for
adjournment at 4:30 a. m. and
planned his announcement the following
evening when the nation’s
radio receivers would be trained on
the convention. B ut he forgot to
tell Chairm an Farley of the plan.
By next evening Mr. Farley, thoroughly
m ad, had wooed and won
California’s C hairm an W illiam
Gibbs McAdoo. On the roll call Mr.
McAdoo was reached first; Democrats
Cermak. McNutt and McHale
never had a chance and their plan
was never m ade public.
Such is the story. But if peace
now reigns between Farley and McNutt,
what can come of it?
AGRICULTURE:
Frozen Asset
Ten years ago science discovered
perishable fruits and vegetables
m igh t be preserved by freezing, thus
providing hotels, hospitals and restaurants
with quasi-fresh products
out of season. So well did the idea
go over that last season a heavierthan-
normal "freeze” was encouraged
despite previous season's
carryovers amounting to 20,000,000
pounds of vegetables and 90,000,000
pounds of fruit. But consumption
dropped unexpectedly last winter.
With a new packing season underway,
food freezers are now surveying
46.000.000 pounds of vegetables
and 86,000,000 pounds of fruit, wondering
how to melt down almost
130,000,000 pounds of frozen assets.
H E A D L I N E R S
CH A R L E S EDISON
The instant death came to 77-
year-old Secretary of the Navy
Claude A. Swanson, his position
went automatically and without
fanfare to the assistant who has
actually managed that department
for the past year—Charles
Edison, son of the late Inventor
Thomas Edison whom he closely
resembles. Though many in administration
circles predicted Mr.
Edison would be named secretary
to succeed Mr.
Swanson, others
thought the post
m ight go to Adm.
W illiam D. Leahy,
retiring chief
of naval operations.
Though only 4!t
years old, Mr.
Edison is no newcomer
to government
circles. He
became assistant In a rle s
secretary of the Edison
navy in 1936, but his real initiation
came during thc World war
—while still in his twenties—when
he directed manufacture of war
materials. Mr. Edison's chief
business interests follow in his
father's footsteps, carrying on th t
utilization by mankind of the instruments
that inventor perfected.
Ju s t as many army administrative
tasks have been given to
Assistant Secretary Louis Johnson,
so has President Roosevelt
placed heavy trust in Mr. Edison
for navy administration during
Secretary Swanson's long illness.
WASHINGTON —Friends of Vice
President John Nance G arner are
naturally delighted with the recent
polls showing that Garner is fa r and
away the most popular of the Democratic
contenders for the presidential
nomination next year, not count- !
ing President Roosevelt himself. His
tremendous lead over New York's
native son, Jam e s A. Farley, who
runs second in the polls, with everybody
else way down the list, is most
impressive.
There is one angle of this, however,
which keeps the whole effect
from being perfect, from the G arner
m en’s viewpoint. That is the
possibility that the effect of such
polls will cause Farley to become
a hundred per cent booster for a
Roosevelt third term. That, to the
Farley men, would be just about the
most terrible thing that could happen.
They are counting heavily on
B ig J im in the next 10 months—
not to aid G arner directly, but to
oppose Roosevelt and thus aid the
Texas candidate indirectly.
F or some tim e now the Garner
folks have admitted privately that
their one big hurdle is Roosevelt
himself, not the fear that he m ight
support some candidate other than
G a rne r—that would not worry them
at all—but the fear that he m ig h t go
after the nomination himself. They
are sure they can beat anyone else
at the Democratic convention. They
th in k they can beat Roosevelt h im self,
but when they begin to talk
about that there is a certain change
in their manners which indicates
that there is at least an element of
doubt.
Hence another phase of the recent
polls, which would seem to indicate
that, at the present moment,
Roosevelt could not carry New York
state against a strong Republican,
is highly satisfactory to the Garner
! workers. Their chief fear about the
delegates at the Democratic national
I convention is that they m ay believe
that Roosevelt is the only Democrat
' who could possibly be elected.
| View Is Unwittingly
j Encouraged by Republicans
Curiously enough thi* view is being
given more encouragement,
though unwittingly, by the Republicans
than by the Roosevelt fanatics
themselves. The point is that every
tim e a Republican leader sounds
off about the third term he creates
the impression that the Republicans
would rather have the Democrats
nominate anyone else than Roosevelt.
Hence the logical deduction
; that the Republicans believe they
would hve more difficulty beating
Roosevelt than any other Democrat.
To a m an interested chiefly in
party success—as many of the delegates
will be, because in the nature
of things they are men either holds
ing office or benefiting in some oth-
| er way from Democratic rule at
Washington—it m ight become very
im portant that the Republicans be-
I lieve Roosevelt would be the hardest
; m a n to beat. It would give Roosevelt
a strong ace in the hole in the
convention maneuvering.
The truth is that there is no such
positive conviction among the Republicans,
though there is enough
| fear that it is true to justify the
1 suspicion. The Republicans have
been concentrating on the anti-third
term tradition bemuse they have
been believing rather firmly up to
! now that Roosevelt would be the
| Democratic nominee.
! Embarrass Advocates of
i Third Term for Roosevelt
New Dealers are terribly annoyed
J over the recent polls, widely pub-
! lished throughout the country. The
move to hove a congressional invesj
tigation of such polls—as to how
they are taken, and particularly why
I they are taken—was born some
weeks before the recent poll of New
York state, which has been more
embarrassing to the advocates of a
third term for Roosevelt than any
one other thing that has happened,
anywhere, any time, or on any subj
Ject.
A very sound argument can be
made against the polls, due to a
queer characteristic of hum an n a ture.
F or some reason there are
, lots of people who like to be band-
! wagon riders. They want to be with
j the winner. This resulted in quite
an outcry from the Democratic
| leaders back in 1916. It will be recalled
that most of the eastern
| states, which reported fairly early
! on election night, went decisively
for Charles E. Hughes. Democratic
leaders contended that something
should be done about this on the
theory that on the Pacific coast pco-
) pie who had not yet voted would
| hear about how the East was going,
] and would be influenced.
■a no doubt that there
truth in it to make it important.
There is another point. So far,
the polls that are now so embarrassing
to New Dealers have been a v
tonishingly correct. But there is no
proving that sooner or later they
will not come a terrific cropper.
That has been the history of all
other polls on elections which have
attracted national attention.
Up to 1916, for example, the polls
taken by the old New York Herald
were am azing in their accuracy. In
that year, every Sunday for months
before election, the Herald editors
apologized to their readers because
they had taken too large a percentage
of their totals in California.
As California was virtually two to
one for Hughes as against Woodrow
Wilson, the editors explained, this
improperly weighted their totals—
making them appear too strong on
the Hughes side.
Polls, Sooner or Later ,
Come a Terrific Cropper
Most people have forgotten, but
that is the explanation of why the
eastern newspaper editors and political
writers were so gullible about
the early returns on that election
night, when, as a m atter of fact,
newspapers of all shades of political
opinion, including the New York
Times, which was ardently for Wilson,
conceded Hughes' election.
That was the end of the Herald
polls. Big newspapers began after
that election sending their own correspondents
over the country to investigate
political situations. But
then came the Literary Digest poll.
Its accuracy was uncanny for
years. In 1936, when every good
political reporter began to suspect
that there was something sour about
it, the poll none the less had the effect
of putting doubt in the minds
even of the most optimistic New
Dealers.
In a subsequent magazine article
Charles Michelson, shrewd director
of New Deal publicity, admitted that
he had spent a lot of money unnecessarily
to combat the last m inute
pay-envelope tax attack of the
G. O. P. forces. He expresses only
scorn for the Literary Digest poll,
but one wonders whether this expense
would have been approved if
there had not been a lingering fear
that maybe the Digest poll was indicating
a ground swell which somehow
escaped investigators.
The new polls are much more scientific,
of course.
Actions Tend to Put Doubt
In the Minds of Voters
Congress has almost gotten back
to no rm al—after more than six
years of following the leader. This
has nothing to do with how much
President Roosevelt succeeds in getting
his way despite the critical
tactics, first of the house, on the
TVA question, and, second, of the
senate, on the silver and devaluation
questions.
Every m em ber of the house voting
against the President on TVA,
and every senator voting against
h im on silver and devaluation knew
that these votes would hurt Mr.
Roosevelt between now and next
June when the Democratic National
convention will pick the party's
nominee for President.
The actions tend to put doubt in
the minds of the voters as to whether
the President is right on TVA,
whether he is sound on the monetary
questions. They will form the
subject of crossroad store debates
all next winter, from Maine to C alifornia,
with the only possible result
that the President will lose a certain
percentage of his supporters.
When the senate and house flght on
such controversial issues it is almost
beyond question that folks will
be found, here and there, who will
take the opposition side, no m atter
what the real merits of the case
may be.
Since the President figures to a
dominating degree in the monetary
disputes, and since his attitude on
TVA is well known, the effect can
only be harm ful to him . Some of
those supporting him up to these issues
are almost bound to leave him.
This is almost an inexorable political
law. It has nothing to do with
Mr. Roosevelt's virtues or failings.
It proves nothing with respect to
them. It is just a thing which always
works.
Despite His Huge Majority
Former I.eaders Opposed Him
This law works with especial rigor
against a President who does a
lot of things. Probably Calvin Coolidge
suffered less from it than any
President since thc Civil war, but
the chief accusation that critics
bring against his record is that he
wos a "d o nothing." Mr. Roosevelt
has done a lot of things. Nearly every
one of them went against the
grain with some of his supporters,
be they few or many.
In 1936, despite his thumping m a jority,
a number of distinguished
former leaders of his party opposed
him publicly. The thing is cum ulative.
Will H. Hays once said that the
function of the Republican national
committee was to "assim ilate, not
elim inate.” The process under discussion
here amounts to a series of
eliminations.
The whole point of this is that every
politician of enough importance
to have gotten elected to the house
or the senate appreciates this political
axiom. So the boys in the senate
knew what they were doing when
they made a spectacular stand
against President Roosevelt.

a complete lack of interest in
the film ; yet she looked back wistfully
as they went up the aisle.
Upon their arrival, she had not removed
her coat till they reached
their seats; but now in the lobby she
expected some word from him about
her new gown. When he said nothing,
merely offered to help her into
her coat, she protested:
“ You haven’t noticed my dress.
Don’t you think it ’s nice?” *
C lint stood back to survey her.
chuckling. “ Sure, g ra n d !” he declared.
He came close to her again.
“ But what you wear doesn’t make
any difference to me, Ju n e .”
“ Asa gave it to m e !”
"A s a ? ” Clint echoed, frowning
faintly. “ W hy?”
She. slipped her arm * into the
sleeves of the coat he held. ‘‘He
told me to wear it to catch a young
m a n !” she confessed, laughing up
at h im over her shoulder. "H e
knows about you and m e .”
Clint chuckled with pleasure. " I t
will be my turn to buy pretty things
for you soon,” he said happily; and
her hand tightened on his arm as
they went out to the car.
They drove slowly, Clint clinging
to this hour; and when they came
in front of the great sprawling house
at last, he stopped and turned off
the lights, and said urgently:
“ Let’s sit here a few minutes. You
don’t have to go right in .”
" I must, soon,” she urged, yet
m ade no move to leave.
They found no great need of
words. They were snug in the car,
the windows raised against the rain.
There was a light in the rear part
of the Taine house; and June said,
with a ripple of m irth in her tones;
“ Uncle Justus is still asleep in
his chair. If no one wakes h im up,
he may sleep there all night.”
“ Is that his room ?” C lint asked,
surprised.
“ No, he’s in the kitchen.” Her
tone was mirthful. “ He likes to
w arm his feet in the oven door.”
"W h o ’s sitting up over there?” he
asked, nodding in the other direction.
“ Aunt Evie and Asa are staying
with Grandm a Bowdon,” she explained.
“ R ab had to go to Providence."
They felt, rather than heard, a
low rumble of sound; and Clint said:
“ Hullo, that was thunder. I d id n’t
see a flash.”
“ I did, out of the corner of m y
eye,” she told h im . “ Off through
the woods that way.” She pointed
past the houses; and she said, and
he heard her voice shake: “ We had
a thunder-shower the night Mother
died. A terrible one. And she added:
“ Uncle Justus has turned out his
light. The thunder must have wakened
h im .” Clint saw that the Taine
house was indeed dark now; and
then Ju ne cried, a sudden tension
in her tones: "C lint, lookl”
“ W h at?” he asked, surprised; and
he stared past her.
There was a faint brightness, in the
shape of a rectangle, against the
front of the Hurder house. The
brightness assumed color; and Clint
reached across the girl to lower the
window so that he might see more
clearly. That rectangle identified itself
as the open front door of the
house, outlined in red.
And suddenly this dull red became
b right; they saw the flicker of a
flame.
They scrambled out together; they
/started to race across the lawn. As
they did so. a car passed along the
road behind them, and Clint turned
back and shouted:
“ Hey, fire! R ing in an a la rm !”
He saw the driver dim ly, saw the
m a n ’s head nod. Then he ran after
June toward the house, toward that
front door through which billows
of smoke began to pour. He caught
her on the steps, caught her fast;
for she would have gone headlong
in. And she was crying:
"G ra n d p a ! G randm a I”
When Clint held her, she swung
to him in terror, beseeching him.
“ They’re in there, Clint. Oh, quick,
d e a r!”
CH APT ER X
Miss Moss had never seen June
Leaford, and as she watched C lint’s
increasing devotion to the girl, during
the fortnight after Mrs. Leaford
died, this fact sometimes disturbed
her.
She said to Tope one evening:
" I ’ve been—asking about her, here
and there. You know Lissa Thayer.
I ’ve spoken to you about her.”
" I know her, yes,” Tope assented.
"L iss a and I have become almost
friends,” Miss Moss explained. ’She
knows about C lint and June. He
often leaves his car there when he
m ilia r sometimes, too friendly, offensive.
She doesn't say much about
Asa, but 1 think she knows h im rath er
well."
Tope reminded her: "A sa went to
see her, the morning after Mrs. Leaford
died. Remember? We met h im
in the woods, and you saw him down
there.”
“ I rem em ber," Miss Moss agreed.
“ It d id n’t seem to me she was glad
to see him , that day . . You know
—I've been trying to guess who will
inherit the Bowdon fortune, now that
Mr. Bowdon is dead. And Mr. Hurder’s
money, when he dies. Mrs.
Leaford would have been Mr. Hurder’s
heir, you know.”
Inspector Tope stared at her.
“ You could outjum p a kangaroo,
Mrs. Tope,” he said, in a deep admiration.
“ You’re three iumps
ahead of m e .” He rose. “ You've
given me enough to think about to
keep me awake,” he said. "A nd
I had as much as I could stand already.
Let's go to bed.”
Hours later, however, something
disturbed Miss Moss. Her eyes
opened and she lay listening. Inspector
Tope here in the bed beside
goes in to the cabin. And Asa and
B a b b u r fa s there for their car.
M jr( R a b i * —unpleasantly ta-
And then Asa came—
her was sleeping. Then she heard
again the sound which had roused
her a m oment ago.
It was the doorbell, ringing in a
long peal, shrill and imperious.
In a swift haste she snapped on
the shaded light beside her bed and
found dressing-gown and slippers.
Then the doorbell rang again, and
Inspector Tope woke and asked:
"W h a t’s the m atte r?”
“ Someone at the door," she said
softly. She went out along the hall
to the living-room, and heard the
Inspector bestir himself behind her,
but she did not wait for him . She
came to the front door and opened
it; and she uttered a low ejaculation
of surprise and of dismay.
For C lint stood there, with a girl
in the circle of his a rm ; and they
were both smoke-begrimed, their
faces sooted and dirty and streaked
with water. Also, C lint’s forehead
was red and inflamed in a streak
across above his eyes, and his eyebrows
were singed, and she saw in
that flrst glance an angry blister on
the back of his right hand.
He said grim ly: "M iss Moss,
here’s my June. I ’ve brought her
h om e !"
"Y o u 're h u r t !" Miss Moss cried.
She remembered to welcome the
girl too. "Come ip, both of you.
Miss Leaford—”
June whispered: His hands are
burned! I wanted him to stop and
get them fixed, but he wouldn't. Oh.
take care of h im .”
Tope uttered a low ejaculation;
he stood blinking in the light. There
was a moment's silence; and then
Clint, his arm still encircling June,
added slowly:
"M r. and Mrs. Hurder—we got
them out; but—”
Miss Moss saw June shudder and
tremble, and she spoke commandingly.
"Come ln ," she directed, and as
they obeyed, she shut the door behind
them. “ Miss Leaford, are you
hurt too?” she asked.
“ No, no," June told her. "Y o u
must fix Clint. I ’m all right.”
Miss Moss nodded. "D o n ’t try to
talk ,” she insisted. "C lint, sit
dqwn. Miss Leaford, come help me.
Soda, I think, is as good as anything.
He needs to be cleaned up,
too. And you'll want to wash
your face, I expect.”
“ I don’t m atte r,” June said. "B u t
Clint's burned terribly.”
C lint protested with r wry smile:
“ Now, sweet, it’s just this blister
on my hand. That’s nothing at a ll."
They found in the end that he had
in fact suffered no more than minor
burns on his hands and wrists, and
that flame-stroke on his brow.
“ I wrapped a wet handkerchief
across m y mouth,” he explained.
“ To keep the smoke out. Had my
hat on, and that helped too.”
M is i Most said cheerfully:
"Y o u 'v e no m or* eyebrows now
than a baby, C lint; and not much
in the way of eyelashes." Sha was
busy tending him .
C lint whispered, through a a t
teeth: "T h a t’s a lot more comfortable.”
Miss Moss ached for him.
He grinned at June, said then to
the older woman: “ This sweet kid
has come to live with you for a
while, Miss Moss. It won’t be long.
Ju s t till she comes to live with m e ."
Miss Moss looked at June, and
saw in the girl's eyes something like
a plea for forgiveness; and June
said softly: “ He's talked so much
about you. I know you must be
hating m e.”
Miss Moss smiled fondly. "No,
dear,” she said gently. “ No, I ’m
glad for both of you.”
Inspector Tope chuckled. “ Well,
now that’s all settled, to the satisfaction
of the womenfolks,” he suggested.
“ How about me? Miss Leaford,
do you m ind if I ask what
happened? You mind telling m e ? "
June shook her head. “ N o ," she
said in a dull tone. “ No. I'd rather
talk, I think, than not.” She made
an uncertain gesture. “ I ’m —I feel
as though I were walking in m y
sleep," she confessed. “ I t doesn't
seem real to m e.”
Miss Moss said briskly: “ We'll
have a cup of chocolate; all feel
better. June, come help me, will
y o u ?" She led the g irl toward the
kitchen, called over her shoulder:
"Inspector Tope, let C lint rest till
we come back. I want to hear.”
But Clint said: “ I don’t want to
rest.” His tone suddenly was grim.
“ Let's go with them. Inspector,"
he suggested; and Miss Moss saw
them come on her heels. In the
little kitchen, while she was busy
about the electric stove, Clint sat on
the sink and drew June close beside
h im ; and these two told what
there was to tell.
" I ’d taken June to see a picture,”
C lint explained. “ But the picture
d id n 't seem to mean much lo us,
so we left early, drove back to
her house. And—parked outside for
a little while.
“ We sat there talking awhile, and
then she saw that the house was on
fire.”
Tope nodded; and June explained:
" I m ust have left the front door
open when I came out, or else I
didn’t latch it and it blew open; because
we saw the flames in the front
h a ll.” And Clint continued:
“ So we started to run toward the
house. A car passed, and I shouted
to the driver to ring in an alarm .
By that time June was on the front
steps. I caught her just in time.
She was going in. The smoke was
pouring out of the door, and there
were flames inside; but she told
me Mr. and Mrs. Hurder were in
there.”
He held June closer, and she
watched him with wide eyes.
" I t was raining,” he explained. " I
wet m y handkerchief in the rain,
and wrapped it over m y mouth and
started to crawl in the hall. But
the smoke drove me back, and then
June said they slept in the wing,
on the ground floor; so we ran
around the house to the window* of
their room.”
He hesitated, then went on: "The
windows were shut, and the curtains
were drawn, but some of the curtains
were on flre. The windows
were all shut tight. I managed to
clim b up and break the glass, with
m y pocket-knife for a hammer. I
reached in and sprung the catch
and pushed the window open. I
guess that's when I burned this
hand; because when I opened the
window a gush of flame came out in
my face, and I let go all holds and
fe ll."
He looked at June.
“ I fell on her,” he said. "She
was right under me. I fell on top
of her.”
" I t didn't h u rt," June insisted.
"So we tried to get in through the
bathroom,” Clint explained. “ Thera
wasn’t any flre in there, so I got
that window up and climbed in: but
when I opened the door into their
room, it was all on fire inside. Fire
was spouting out of the wall right
beside the bathroom door."
“ The laundry-chute is there,”
June interrupted.
"A nd it was roaring in the cellar,”
Clint confessed. " I could feel
it hot under my feet. The smoke
was pretty bad. Then a piece of
the floor in front of me burned
through; and then the flames licked
up at me, and I had to back out and
shut the bathroom door.”
"B u t you said you got them out,”
Tope reminded him. “ Mr. and Mra.
H urder."
“ I ’m coming to that,” C lint explained.
“ We tried another window,
right beside their beds. I
smashed it open, and smoke poured
out, but no flames. So I straddled
the sill and m y foot hit their bed inside."
He spoke rapidly, his eyes
fixed straight ahead. " I felt someone,
and I dragged Mrs. Hurder up
and lowered her out of the window
to June, and then him. The bed
was all afire, little flames."
And he said, looking at the girl
beside h im : “ They weren’t burned
much, I don’t think. We were just
in time. The fire spread awfully
fast.”
Inspector Tope suggested: “ Fire
department must have been there
by the n!”
Clint shook his head. “ No, they
weren’t! They didn't get there till
after Mrs. Taine did. Not till after
Asa did. as a matter of fact. June
and I had been pretty busy, but it
must have been quite a while.”
Miss Moss echoed: “ Mrs. T aine?"
“ You see,” Clint explained, “ Mrs.
Taine and Asa w.'re staying with
Mrs. Bowdon last night. Mrs. Taine
said they d id n ’t hear anything till
their lights went out, and she went
to look at the fuses, and saw the
fire through the pantry window.
She came running over, just about
the time we got the old people out;
and then Asa came. He and I carried
them into the Bowdon house,
out of the rain. And Mrs. Taine and
June started taking care of them.
But June came out again when I
d id .”
"Were they dressed?” Tope asked.
“ Mrs. Taine and A sa?”
“ Oh, yes," Clint said casually ; and
he went on: "B y the tim e the fire
engines came, one wing was all
afire, and the other was well started;
and they couldn't get the plug
off the hydrant right away. There's
only one hydrant and that was
three or four hundred yards down
the hill. The whole thing went, before
they got it checked at a ll."
“ Burn to the ground?"
“ The floors fell in,” Clint assented.
“ And part of the roof. I don’t
know; maybe the walls wouldn’t
go."
June's eyes were closed, and Miss
Moss tried to sign to Inspector Tope
to be still; but he asked insistently:
"W h at about the others? Mr. Taine,
and Rab? Where were the y ?"
It was June who answered: “ Rab
had gone to Providence right after
supper," she said. "H e had a case
in court there tomorrow morning.
And Uncle Justus is deaf. He
wouldn't hear anything.” She remembered:
"We saw him turn out
his light to go to bed, just before
we saw the fire.”
“ Saw h im ? " Tope echoed.
"S aw his light go out.” June
amended. " In the kitchen. He liked
to go to sleep in his chair after
supper, and sometimes he didn’t
wake up at all. But we saw h it
light go out."

Finds Death Trees, Feared by Indians,
Tribesmen Also Claim Aid in Gambling
“ Trees of death,” gnarled shrubs
which are held in superstitious awe
by Indians, have been discovered
in * lonely canyon.
John W. Hilton, authority on desert
lore, has disclosed that he found
the trees after a long fight to overcome
superstitious fears of Indians.
The sap of the “ tree of death,” or
elephant tree, is believed by the
C ahuilla Indians to be a deadly poison
for doing away with enemies
quietly, Mr. Hilton said.
They also believe, he said, that
in the hands of medicine men it can
drive away evil spirits and that, if
prepared and used properly, it gives
extra keen perception in playing
pion and other gambling games.
The recently discovered trees are
believed to be the farthest north on
record.
“ Knowing better than to ask d irect
questions about the fabled
trees, I had to wait u ntil some In dian
told me about the whole affa
ir,” Mr. Hilton said. “ Finally the
son-in-law of a very old and powerful
medicine m an claim ed to know
where the tree was and agreed to
lead me to the spot for $5.
“ High u p » t h i canvon w t
stopped, but the Indian, saying that
the wind was blowing toward us
from the tree, took a zig-zag course
up a mountain so as to approach
the tree from behind. But our
search was fruitless. The guide decided
that the tree did not wish to
be found, and we went home.
“ Later, however, a young educated
Indian took me directly to
the tree.
“ The Indian guide stabbed the
trunk of the tree and a blood-like
substance oozed out.”
Mr. Hilton then carefully plucked
sample sprouts from the bush and
took them to the government date
gardens at India, where experts
identified them as Bursera microphylla,
or elephant tree.
Mrs. Clay Was Taking No
Chances After That!
In a certain little village situated
in the backwoods where the
people were not overly ambitious,
there stood an old cottage, the
door of which had to be lifted a
little before it could be opened.
For this purpose a hatchet was
kept near by.
One evening there was a knock
at the door, and the young son of
the house was sent to see who it
was.
“ Who is it? ” inquired the lad,
before opening the door.
“ I t ’s m e , Mrs. C lay,” said the
voice outside.
Recognizing the voice, the boy
called back to his mother:
“ I t ’s Mrs. Clay, Mum . Where
is the hatchet?”
And when they opened the door,
to their surprise their visitor was
nowhere to be seen.

Capitol Notes
In its first major decision since it
was set up by the present legislature
the state employment relations board
ordered the United Electrical Radi*)
and Machine Workers’ Union, a CIO
affiliate at the Allen-Bradley plant in
Milwaukee to refrain from mass
picketing at or near the plant, from
threatening employes of the company,
obstructing and interfering with the
entrance and exit of the plant, and
from picketing the homes of company
employes. The board allowed a picket
line of not more than 15 persons.
Senator Risser, Madison, Progressive.
was not impressed by Governor
Heil's explanation of the tardiness in
signing highway contracts. Said he,
•‘It is a paltry excuse to an uninformed
public. The odd part of the whole
business is that not all of the contracts
were withheld, only those from
certain areas.”
After receiving complaints at the
Madison and Milwaukee offices of the
state automobile license division that
the paint on the 1939 license plates is
easily rubbed off, the division said if
the motorists would bring in their
plates they would be repainted at no
cost to the motorists.
After Governor Heil’s veto of the
bill eliminating all trading stamps by
gasoline stations, the senate voted 22
to 8 to override the veto. Similar
action by the assembly will nullify the
veto.

the Home, eats his meals in his study,
and the rest o f his time is spent at
“ Dixie”. Here he works from early
morning until late at night, or until
he gets so tired he can hardly walk
home any more. He rented the cottage
to a man and wife with three
children for Four Dollars per month.
The man paid the rent for two months,
but then refused to pay any more and
also refused to vacate. In order to
induce the man to vacate he took the
roof off the building. This worked
like a charm. The Good Shepherd
Home has no patent on this method of
getting people to vacate. I f you have
a^y tenants that you want to vacate
you can use this method withou fear
of infringing on any patent right.
When you visit Allentown, be sure to
visit the Good Shepherd Home, and
also go four squares south from the
Eighth Street Bridge on Eighth Street
to the cottage called “ Dixie” . It is
really a wonderful place, worth while
seeing. The place is becoming a wild

are raised here and what he can

Amusing things are happening every

We thought our Institution readers

“We have a Doctor of Divinity from

multiply. The latest scientific report
is that they grandmother in less than
twenty-four hours. W’e admit that it
probably was not necessary to go so
far for the specimens, but remember
that I am only reporting what I was
told. I did not see the transaction, but
observed the effect the report hat! on

Pilots Lose to Edgar
A crippled Wittenberg team took
the field against the strong Edgar
team Sunday and went down to defeat
6 to 3.
Storm, who went to the mound for
the Pilots when Krull, ace pitcher,
failed to show up, had very little on
the ball, coupled with a costly error by
Coyle in the second, gave the Edgar
team a lead the Pilots could not overcome.
Palladeau took up the mound duties
in the third, retired the first three i
batters to face him via the strike-out
route, and pitched a whale of a game
the rest of the way, considering that
he has only pitched two times before
in three years.
The management wishes to state
that the Pilots have signed up Lefty
Joe Petcka, who will throw his first
game for Wittenberg Sunday against
Elderon at Elderon.
With two hurlers like Palladeau and
Petcka, the Pilots are again pennant
bound, so be on hand Sunday, fans, at
Elderon.

During the past 10 years Wisconsin j

dollars in new plants und improvements

of 14 million dollars in
Georgia and 5 million iu Louisiana.
In addition practically all wood used
in Wisconsin plants is shipped in from
Canada with high transportation costs.
In the south, however, vast areas of
forests are available, und in addition
labor and the electricity from federal

The proposed freight rate increase

Sherlock Holmes
Basil Rathbone, co-featured with
Richard Greene and Wendy Barrie in
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s “The Hound
of the Baskervilles," portrays the
famous Sherlock Holmes in the 20th
Century-Fox film showing Friday and
Saturday, Ju ly 21 and 22, at the
Badger Theatre. Nigel Bruce plays
Dr. Watson.
“The Hound of the Baskervilles” is
the spine-tingling, suspense-taut tale
of the unearthly beast with baleful j
eyes and hideous howl, prowling the
fog-shrouded English moor, striking
terror into the hearts of two young
lovers and leaving a trail of horror so
terrifying that only Sherlock Holmes
dare follow. In the perfect-fitting role
of the great detective, Rathbone is receiving
the greatest acclaim of his
career. At the studio preview of the
finished production, Nigel Bruce, who
knew Conan Doyle well, was deeply
impressed by Rathbone’s characterization
of Holmes.

life story, the result of perseverance,

should encourage and embolden those
who feel their particular talents are
unwanted in a supposedly career-filled
world. The story of a resolute, poor,
unassuming American boy who achieved
fame in spite of obstacles, heartaches
and disappointments, “The Flying
Irishman” is not only an account
of Corrigan’s life, but a saga of youth.
Paul Kelly, Robert Armstrong, Eddie
Quillan and Donald MacBride have

Crowds Flock to Great Medicine
Sale at Local Dm# Store.
The great sale of RU X Compound
still goes on, and each day the fame of
this remarkable medicine spreads
throughout Wittenberg and vicinity as
more and more people hear from the
lips of grateful users their amazing
stories of relief.
An Amazing Experience
Only one of a flood ef letters recently
received is this statement of
happy relief by Mr. Herman Koehler,
well known resident of Green Bay, living
at 829 Christiana Street.
“ I am writing this statement for
the purpose of telling other Rheumatic
Pain sufferers how much RUX Compound
helped me. For some time I
have been having Rheumatic Pains in
my legs and hands. A t times it would
feel as though someone were jabbing
me with a sharp knife. I heard of
RUX Compound and decided to try it.
I can say that R lIX certainly helps me
in relieving these pain attacks. I can
recommend highly for what it
done for ms.”
\ I^ H A T are the secret ambitions
* * o f those who serve us, particularly
those whose occupations
are mechanical or lonesome enough
to allow their minds to drift often
into the realms of fantasy?
Walt Disney is an example. Born
in Chicago in 1901, his first job was
as a mail carrier there, at the age
of sixteen. As a little boy he liked
to draw, and he liked to draw anim
als; but the famous creator of
Mickey Mouse had to make a living
delivering mail. He had no chance
to express his creative genius until
after the World war, when he
obtained a job as a commercial
artist in Kansas City. In his garage,
he experimented with animated
newsreels called “ Local Happenings,”
which he sold to Kansas City
moving picture theaters. He followed
these with a series of fairy
tales for local clubs and church
gatherings.
This modest success prompted
him to try Hollywood, where he
started in an unpretentious little
building far from the big studios.
There he created “ Oswald, the
R a b b it,’’ but after making 26 subjects,
he and his backer separated.
The backer owned the rights to
“ Oswald, the R a b b it” which is still
being shown in the theaters, and
Disney was left without his most
promising character. Out of this
adversity was b o r n “ Mickey
Mouse” and the “ Silly Symphonies.”
Today, Walt Disney employs a
staff of artists to draw his characters
but he is, himself, the voice of
Mickey Mouse. And his famous little
character is the most beloved
and the most commercialized of all
creations of the fantasy.

“iVoises in the Night”
He l l o e v e r y b o d y :
There came a time when Frank Barry had to prove he
wasn’t a coward—and this is what happened!
Frank’s address is Albion, Mich. He lives out in the country
with his wife and at night the place gets sort of lonely. That
would be all right as far as Frank was concerned, but Frank
says that his wife is “somewhat nervous.”
On top of that, Frank’s wife is a light sleeper. And what with
one thing or another, she was beginning to suspect that Frank
had a yellow streak in him about a yard wide. Frank didn’t
feel that way about it. With him it was just a case of wanting
to sleep at night. I ’ll let him tell you about the trouble in his
own words.
“ Every time a mouse would scamper across the floor,”
says Frank, ‘‘my wife would poke me in the ribs and whisper,
‘Frank—Frank! Wake up! I hear noises!’ Not being
of a nervous nature myself, it was hard to wake me up. When I Anally
did awaken to hear a mouse playing about the room, I would mumble,
'It's only a mouse,' and fall asleep ag a in."
It was just plain sleepiness on F rank's part—but his wife began to
believe F ran k was afraid to go down and take a chance on meeting up
with a burglar. She never said so, but F rank could tell from the way
she looked at him at times. And F rank, on the other hand, began wishing
a b urglar would bust into the house, just so he could go down
and show wifie that he wasn’t afraid.
Frank’s Wife Hears a Noise in the Cellar.
“ W e ll,” lay s F ran k, “ one night the opportunity came, and now my
h air is g ray .” That night was October 25, 1922. F ran k sort of had
burglars on his m ind that night.
That day he h id picked a lot of apples and vegetables and
stored them In the cellar. He had lett the outside cellar door
open.
That night, ju st as he w a i drifting off to sleep he heard a
crash and felt his wife’s elbow in his ribs. "F r a n k ,” she whispered,
"d id you hear th a t? ’’ F rank had heard it. It was no
moose this time. A box had fallen down in the cellar! And then
F ran k remembered that open cellar door. Here were his burglars!
"A n d then,” says F rank, " I began to realize that I was scared to
death.”
The cold shivers were running down F ran k ’s back, but he didn't
tell his wife. "A s I lay there debating whether I should be a live coward
or a dead hero,” he says, "m y wife said, 'D id you hear me.

F rank, clinging to the Thing, was carried up the cellar stairs.
F ran k? If you d id n ’t something must be the matter with you.’ And
there was something the matter with me. I was scared."
But Frank knew that if he showed the white feather now, his wife i
would remember it the rest of her life. He slipped out of bed and drew
on his pants and socks. He left his shoes off because he d idn't want to
make any noise, and he took no light because a light would only make
h im a better target for robbers’ guns. He picked up his own revolver and
groped his way down stairs.
Down in the cellar he could hear boxes moving and apples rolling
around. He locked the inside door so the burglars couldn't get into
the house. Then he crept outside, down the cellar steps and into the
cellar.
Frank Hears an Inhuman Sound.
"B y that tim e ,” says F ran k, "m y fear had left me. If a robber
shot at me, tbe flash of his gun would show me where to
shoot. I had as good a chance as he.” But F rank's fear of burglars
had only moved out to m ake room for a greater fear—
the horrible fear of the unknown.
It was deathly still in that cellar. F rank listened breathlessly,
intently. "The stillness,” he says, "seemed to grow even more silent,
and the suspense increased. Then, all of a sudden I heard a strange,
blood-curdling sound—a sound that I knew came from nothing human.
My God, what could it be? I didn’t have long to ponder that question.
In a split second the Thing was on me, sweeping me off m y feet.”
Frank had arrived at that cellar door ready to fight burglars,
but he wasn't prepared to meet up with something that
wasn't human. He fell forward across the Thing, and clutched
at it in panic. The Thing was immense—a veritable monster.
It dashed up the cellar steps and Frank, still clinging to it, was
carried up feet flrst.
“ Its strength,” he says, "w a s irresistible. I felt as though I was
nothing more than a feather in a giant’s hands. Many fears passed
through my mind during the few seconds which that ghastly ride lasted,
but all of them were too preposterous to believe. If I could have
believed one of them I m igh t have felt better. Anything was better
than being at the mercy of an unknown monster.”
But suddenly the monster was out in the open and F rank was losing
his hold. He rolled off and fell to the ground. When he got up he had
regained his composure—and also his senses.
Frank went into the house and got a lantern. Then he went
out again and walked to the barn. Sure enough there was his
monster, and his hunch had been right. Standing by the gate
was F rank's 500-pound boar hog. He had escaped from the barnyard
and gone into the cellar looking for an evening snack.
And when he ran out of the cellar in ala rm , his nose went between
F ran k ’! wide spread legs, throwing F rank over on his
back.
F rank says his wife thinks this story funny, and tells it to all her
friends. “ But it was mighty real to m e,” F ran k says, " I d id n’t know
fright could be that b a d !”

Idleness
Exertion, whether called labor,
recreation, or amusement, is essential
to health; and, as the body
was m ade for labor, work is its
natural and honorable duty. An
idle m a n or woman is a discredit
to the race, and unusually liable
to fall into disease, whilst an industrious
person adds to the
wealth of the country, and is more
likely to be healthy and happy.

Cooling Summer Drink*
Can you think of anything more

several degrees.

Make Modern Laundry Out
Of Waste Space Upstairs
Waste space upstairs can easily
be fashioned into a modern laundry,
brightened up with paint and hung
with some of those attractive lowpriced
curtains that are always bobbing
up in such variety. If you
read floor plans of modern houses
you have discovered the growing
trend for ofF-the-kitchen-laundries.
E quipment designed for such rooms
includes washers that p um p themselves
empty.
Ironing has always been an upstairs
operation, possibly because it
is easier to transfer ironed clothes
to proper storing places without danger
of over-mussing. Many ironers
have table tops that serve a real
purpose in the small kitchen, and
there are washers tailored to kitchen
size, too.
House Cleaning Is Made
Easy by Use of Vacuum
The days are gone forever when,
to clean a rug thoroughly, it was
necessary to hang it on a clothesline
or lay it on the grass and beat it
with a bamboo or steel wire contraption.
Today, thanks to electricity
and thc vacuum cleaner, rug beat,
ing is a thing of the past in m illions
of homes. Moreover, in addition
to elim inating much work and
drudgery, the vacuum cleaner
raises practically no dust and thua
greatly reduces the time required
for dusting.
Household Refrigerator
To get the best results from the
household refrigerator, it is well to
decide in advance which foods are
to go in and which ones to be
taken out instead of pondering the
question while the door is open.
Every time that happens the tem perature
goes up and the longer the
door stays open the higher up it
goes. Another wise precaution is to
make sure that cooked foods are
well cooled before putting them into
the food chest, otherwise the heat
and moisture generated will also
cause the temperature to rise.
Yellow for Light
To brighten a poorly lighted bedroom,
a color scheme includes walls
painted daffodil yellow, a paler yellow
ceiling and white woodwork
with thin lines of orange color.

Indian Painter
T H E early painters of American
* Indian life were all adventurous
m en, but John Mix Stanley had
more than his share of perils and
narrow escapes from death.
Stanley first became interested in
Indians in 1838 and went to Fort
Snelling, Minn., to paint them. During
the next eight years he made
frequent visits to picture the tribes
of the Southwest. In 1846 he joined
the famous march of General Kearney
and his dragoons from Santa
Fe to San Oiego, during which time
he laid down his painter’s brush to
take up a gun and fight in several
engagements.
The next year Stanley found more
excitement awaiting him in the
North. He narrowly escaped being
in the Whitman massacre when that
missionary, his wife and 11 others
were killed by the Cayuses in east
ern Washington He had another
close call when he returned to San
Francisco to take ship for New York
via Cape Horn, for he arrived just
too late to go aboard. That ship was
lost at sea and was never heard of
again.
In 1853 Stanley was appointed artist
to the expedition sent to explore
a route for a Pacific railroad from
St. Paul to Puget Sound. After a
series of adventures with that expedition,
he returned to the East,
where he died in 1872. The last
years of his life were saddened by
the loss of more than 150 paintings
of Indian life which he had spent
10 years in m aking and which were
destroyed by a fire in the Smithsonian
institution in 1865.

Aguinaldo’s Captor
I N 1901 America had a new nation-
1 al hero— " a little m an with a
slight limp, with a Vandyke beard
and a sense of humor that bubbled
in him like the effervescence of
w ine." His name was Frederick
Funston, former student at the University
of Kansas, newspaper reporter
and member of a filibustering
expedition to deliver to Cuban
revolutionists five Hotchkiss guns
for use against the Spanish. He
was made a captain of artillery and
in 18 months fought in 22 engagements.
Then the Spanish put a
price on his head and he barely
managed to escape and return to
the United States.
At the outbreak of the Spanish-
American war Funston raised a regiment
of Kansas volunteers and was
made its colonel. He was sent to
the Philippines and aided in the
capture of Manila. In August, 1898,
Em ilio Aguinaldo started an insurrection
against the new masters of
the islands and for the next three
years led 70,000 American soldiers
and their native auxiliaries a merry
chase.
F inally he was located in southern
Luzon and Funston, by now a
brigadier-general of volunteers,
formed a daring plan to capture
him . Taking two captains and two
lieutenants, Funston led a party of
80 Macabebe scouts toward Aguinaldo's
hiding place. They were to
pass themselves off as a detachment
of insurgent Tagalogs who had
captured these five Americans and
were bringing them to Aguinaldo.
It was a risky business for everything
depended upon the faithfulness
of the Macabebes.
But they played their part to perfection
and the American "c a p tives"
were delivered to Aguinaldo.
Then they revfaled their identity
and calmly informed Aguinaldo that
he was their prisoner.

Confederate Mail Runner
p O R 10 years before the Civil war
" Absalom Grim es was a Mississippi
river pilot, running between St.
Louis and St. Paul. At the outbreak
of the war he enlisted in a company
of "irre g u la rs,” raised in Ralls
county west of Hannibal, Mo., to
recruit the Confederate army. One
of the members of this company
was a young fellow named Sam
Clemens. Years later Mark Twain
referred to his "short and inglorious
m ilitary career” in that company
which decamped hastily at the first
appearance of an enemy force and
soon afterwards disbanded.
Grimes then volunteered for service
as a mail carrier between the
Missouri and Kentucky troops in
the Confederate arm y and their relatives
at home. It was an extremely
hazardous duty for It meant going
through the Union lines at the
peril of capture and execution as a
spy. During the siege of Vicksburg
he ran the blockade successfully by
wiring his m ail in tin boxes to the
bottom of an overturned skiff and
floating beside it among the Union
gunboats until he had passed them.
G rimes was repeatedly captured
by the Union forces and twice he
was sentenced to death. He spent
several months in the old Gratiot
prison in St. Louis and was there
under sentence of death at the end
of the war. However, his life was
saved by an unconditional pardon
issued by A braham Lincoln—among
the last acts of mercy performed
by the President before he was assassinated.

H EN it comes to the voguishness
of prints versus pastels
in the present mode the matter resolves
itself into pretty much of a
fifty-fifty proposition. Which is to
say that the m idsummer collections
are made up of a goodly showing of
each.
There is no doubt as to the im portance
of pastels especially for
cleverly tailored daytime dresses
that observe a nicety of detail which
gives them "class” in the eyes of
discriminating women who know
their fashions. Favor for pastels
is expressed not only in silk crepes
and sheer woolens but a hue and
cry is resounding for smart linens
in delectable muted pinks and
blues, rose shades, cool-looking
greens and grays, light yellows, lavenders
and novelty shades as cyclamen,
tulip shades and such. White
linens and linens au natural are
also chic.
One reason for the big splurge
that linens are making this season
is that through the wonders of modern
scientific processing newer linens
carry a promise of nonwrinkling
and non-shrinking.
At the top of the picture to the
left see the attractive spectator
sports dress of pastel blue creaseresistant
imported linen. It has one
of the very smart umbrella-tucked
skirts. A belt braided in matching
blue, fuchsia and yellow silk floss
says color in unmistakable terms.
The boutonniere is of self-linen and
the cunning poke bonnet is of white
straw.
The dress to the right in the background
of this group is of a nubby
sheer, pure linen in a delectable
shell pink. Fitted waistline and
sleeves cleverly appliqued with con-
Play Suits Adopt
‘Little Girl’ Air
Some of the new play suits have
S little-girl air. A 1939 variation of
the popular shirt, shorts, skirt combination
is made of gay floral
striped cotton, and links a one-piece,
puff-sleeved play suit and a detachable
skirt hemmed with a frill.
Another, of ticking, is made up
of a square-necked puff sleeved
frock and shorts of the same material.
Tennis fans are choosing more
dresses than shorts for play this
year, one of New Y o rk’s smartest
shops reports. The smartest are
white pique rayon or linen, designed
with brief gored or plaited skirts
ending above the knee.
Enthusiasm Grows
For White Jersey
The practicality of white Jersey,
the smart appearance, the adaptability
to sculptural draping and exquisite
tailoring has so impressed
designers they are expressing an
enthusiasm for it that knows no
bounds. Try out a costume of Jersey
and see what it does for you.
It will slenderize you, it will be to
the touch the sort you “ love to
w e ar." The white rayon Jersies especially
come out after a tubbing
"w hite as snow” which is exactly
what every woman hopes for, even
longs for in her white costumes.
Diamond Earrings
E arrings, particularly diamond
and pearl ones, are becoming increasingly
important as accents for
every costume.
trasting bands of periwinkle blue
and strawberry linen are highspots
in its styling. Sunburst tucks at the
neckline, and unpressed pleats in
the skirt, are also significant details.
Every dress with a jacket is
fashion's decree this season which
accounts for a matching shell pink
bolero which you carry or which
you wear according to pomp and circumstances.
Before leaving the linen theme,
just a word in regard to the smart
looking redingotes tailored of white
or natural linen which ladies of fashion
are wearing over their lingerie
frocks this summer. They are a
modern version of the one-time honored
"linen duster.”
In regard to the silk prints that
are every where present, and which
are in friendly rivalry to smart
linens, there is a decided flair
among women who dress in the
height of fashion for patternings
that run to neat checks, and to
plaids and stripes with nothing less
than a stampede for dotted effects
of every description. As the m idseason
approaches suits of the new
check silks will come into play in
perfect fashion.
To the left in the foreground of
the illustration a fashionable miss
is wearing a sm art frock for a day
under the sun in the country. The
dress is of blue silk with white
pin dots. The collar piece is white,
likewise belt and buttons.
A gay and colorful evening gown
is shown to the right It is of Scotch
plaid trim m ed with lace. The
white organza blouse is also
trim m ed with lace. The full floor
length skirt of gay print with dainty
lingerie shirtwaist is r favorite evening
fashion formula.
