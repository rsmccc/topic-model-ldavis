1 THE SCHOOL GIRL PROBLEM
orj Bert F Johnson has several names
!ge listed at his office o f those who are
lad  Pen f r keeping school girls during
er t le year In line with that the folded
l w ng contribution on the question
will be found o f interest A little
p later there will be an article on the
[u side o f the lady of the house 
Am 1 Earning My Board and R oom  
 as If I were a high school girl lookick
ing for worlc to earn my hoard and
iry roo!t1 I would want to have some
 definite understanding with my emm
ployer as to just what or how much
rst wou d he expected o f me The best
 g way to find that out would be to
}c have a personal interview 
Will I be expected to do wishes
re three times a day  I will for break 
 fast if the family arranges to have
this morning meal so that I will have
sufficient time to do the work and
at still get to school by eight fifteen
at o clock Whether that deadline be
seven thirty or seven forty five will
depend on the number o f dishes to be
 washed and the distance to go to
school There is little probability o f
my doing dishes at noon since I must
 gt have time to go home eat lunch
ej (without gobbling it down) and find
re myself in the class room again by one
a o clock ready to give that oral report
r a before the English class or whatever
rs the assignment may call for that day 
 Please remember that when I arrive
u at school I must have time to pass
 r through crowded hallways to my
rj locker to remove wraps assemble ne 
0f cessary books and sharpen pencils
jn which have a way o f breaking off just
j e the last minute and get up to third
0f floor before the bell rings without
taking three steps at a time and be 
Bd ing reprimanded by some member of
the faculty Yes under ordinary con 
 r ditions I can arrange to do the eve 
3d ning meal dishes alone if necessary 
and be through by seven thirty or
]e eight o clock This will give you (the
nd housewife) an opportunity to spend
Pjg evenings with your family or do what 
3y ever you like After dishes I would
a like to read listen to the radio work
on my hobby and attend basket ball
j games or go to a show My mother
[ expects me to remain at home evejn
nings except for special functions as
of
listed above She hopes that you will
!S have my interests at heart so that I
le may have your guidance and supervine
sion at all times and I would appre 
 e ciate that very much too Because
at
I usually will be at home evenings I
h will take care o f the children 
Is much cooking expected o f me 
Breakfast is usually the easiest meal
to prepare and I would not object to
st helping with its preparation or poses
sibly taking full charge o f it I
lg could help with last minute preparail 
tions o f the lunch or dinner at noon
ar and certainly help with the preparation
o f the evening meal and serve
2y it And of course as already stated 
I will do the dishes 
And how about cleaning work 
 Certainly I should see that my own
ue room is left in perfect order before
fie leaving for school in the morning 
5 Perhaps it would be arranged to do
light cleaning as dusting some time
of during the day before school at
n noon or after school I will always
ro plan to be home ready for work at
 d five o clock Sometimes certain acty
tivities as class meetings or club
iir meetings like Etiquette Club takes
I t place after school I have had a long
busy day and Mother thinks a little
le nap would be good for me before I
5 start working for you at five It will
keep me from becoming irritable and
r too tired before the evening is over 
le Then the period from five until time
re to help with the evening meal is left
le to your discretion I would not mind
 s doing plain ironing another day some
r baking or light cleaning work or annt
other afternoon taking care o f chilv 
dren If some time you would like to
shift duty like having me take care o f
id the children from four to five and
 re then perhaps excuse me from evening
dishes I will be glad to make necessary
arrangements 
r I think you will agree with me that
y this schedule plus a regular day at
e school is a full program for a grow 
3 ing girl 
id Perhaps a few general suggestions
)f would assist the employer when a job
r hunter comes calling Explain your
ss program o f work to the girl Strive
for a well organized plan o f work 
ty it may differ in many respects from
the one given and still be good As
far as it is possible give her definite
It jobs to be completed in a reasonable
f length o f time so that she will know
le what is expected and at what time
t she may be free Regular cleaning 
 o ironing and washing are a full time
 e maid s job It might be suggested
s that employer an employee work out
d together a schedule to meet the famn
ily needs and that each keep a copy
h or have the original posted on the
back o f the cabinet door in the kit 
chen as a handy reference and re 
 minder Then when you have made
is your choice give the girl a welcome
e that will make her feel that she is
3 really wanted in the home If you
f make her happy in your home show
an interest in her welfare and give
i her the proper guidance you are don
ing a really worth while service 
it which the girl her family and your
r community will appreciate and ad

Checks totaling $4 438 979 60 are
being mailed by the State Highway
Commission to the 71 Wisconsin
county treasurers as state aid for
county trunk highways 
Jackson county s check being sent
to County Treasurer Carl G Monsos 
will amount to $55 073 54 the State
Highway commission reports 
Increased state aid fo r county
highways was voted by the 1939
legislature Last year the total distributed
by the state to the counties
fo r use on their county trunk sysems
was $3 000 000 Under the new
law the amount to be divided am ong
counties was increased to $3 500 000 
and in addition each county receives
an extra $65 per mile fo r all county
trunk mileage The $3 500 000 fund
is divided on the basis o f 40 per cent
in the ratio that registered m otor vehicles
in the county bear to the total
state registration and 60 per cent
in the ratio that all highways in the
county exclusive o f city or village
streets and roads bear to the total
mileage o f highways in the state 
The county trunk highway money
now being received in this county is
one o f three m ajor aids received here
each year The other two aids are
the privilege tax refunded cities villages
and towns in lieu o f the old
property tax assessed against m otor
vehicles and the state aid fo r town
roads city and village streets 
These three state aids plus funds
expected to be used in maintaining
state highways in the 71 counties and
the county allotments fo r construction
on state highway or retirem ent
o f county bonds previously issued fo r
construction on state highways will
account fo r approxim ately 90 cents
out o f every $ 1 o f state highway revenue
anticipated in the 1939 40 fiscal
year The approximate breakdown
is 40 cents fo r state aids 27
cents fo r construction and 23 cents
fo r maintenance 
The remaining 10 cents out o f the
highway dollar pays fo r the state
planning board topographical map o f
the state road marking safety promotion 
construction o f interstate and
intrastate bridges connecting roads
to charitable and penal institutions 
state park and state forest roads free
highway maps railroad grade crossing
improvements highway free fund
used fo r construction materials survey 
and general administration 
State aid fo r town roads city and
village streets also was increased by
the 1939 legislature 
In 1938 Jackson county received
$35 554 89 as its share o f the $3 
0 0 0 0 0 0 sum distributed fo r state
aids to county trunks 
This year s checks however total
$4 438 979 60 going to counties fo r
use in construction maintenance

She was united in marriage with C 
C Snippen Septem ber 24 1882 at
Black River Falls and shortly after
established their residence in W arrens
where Mr Snippen was em ployed
in the W arren B arber mills consequently
she had been practically a
life lon g resident in this vicinity She
had been an active m em ber o f the
W arrens Baptist church during all
this time and her faithfulness and
tireless activity was a constant inspiration
to her associates even in
the later days o f failing health she
was faithful in attendance at church
services often at the cost o f considerable
effort Nowhere perhaps did
her sweet Christian spirit make its
influence felt more effectively than
in the home and the influence o f
her fine Christian character was reflected
in the lives o f her children

her tw o having died in infancy
and notwithstanding that she had
surpassed the allotted three score
years and ten o f human life and the

James McGinnis o f Merrillan 
is a very real person h ow ever but
he might pass fo r the ghost o f W ill
Rogers because o f his almost minute
resemblance to him His facial features 
his general posture and even
his drawl are so similar to the beloved
w it that Mr McGinnis finds himself
very much in demand as a model 
He has posed fo r a statue o f W ill
Rogers that is erected in H ollyw ood
and at the present time he is taking
the Rogers part in a film production
o f a sequel to The Call o f the

McGinnis is a man o f about
50 years 
One o f the anecdotes which Mr 
McGinnis tells is that Jeanette McDonald

 saving the users o f electricity over
one million dollars annually not only
by providing cheap electric energy to
its members but by causing public
utilities to decrease their rates Mr 
Carmody has a keen and heartfelt
interest in the success o f R E A projects
and upon retiring as administrator
o f the RE A he sent a letter
to all members and employes o f REA

One naturally wonders how much
the war talk abroad as well as here
at home is influenced by the profits
from war materials There are several
bills before the Senate and House pro
viding fo r an em bargo on shipments
o f such materials to Japan fo r instance 
The sentiment o f the country
undoubtedly very strongly supports
some such measure The lobbies o f
the interests opposed to that form o f
w ar prevention have been su fficiently
active to keep the measures from
com ing out o f the committees this
session Importers o f silks toys and
textiles from Japan likewise have
been active In consequence Congress
will adjourn as our materials continue
to flow across the P acific to assist
Japan in the subjugation o f
China 
F or the three fiscal years 1934
1935 and 1936 there were exported
by this country one billion three hundred
million dollars o f supplies fo r
war preparations abroad During the
fiscal years 1937 1938 and 1939
those exports had increased to two
billion five hundred millions Our
exporters therefore have had the pro
fits on three billion eight hundred
millions o f dollars o f war material
shipments It is contended that but
fo r these shipmemts our ow n econom ic
situation would be far worse than it
is and nearly everybody believes it
is bad enough at present The argument
carries weight with many peo
pie T oo few stop to think that these
shipments o f war materials have prevented
the export o f many other products
including agricultural products 
Some foreign countries are spending
60 per cent o f their entire national incom
es on preparations fo r war Certainly
our country as a whole has not
gained in supplying the materials fo r
the future conflict 
Included in the president s spending
bill is a provision fo r 750 million
dollars fo r a five year super highway
program The Federal Bureau o f Public
Roads has made a very com plete
survey o f the possibilities o f this program 
Unfortunately not a sufficient
num ber have been printed to give the
thousands o f people interested in the
subject an opportunity to read the report 
W isconsin is one o f the states
through which it is proposed to build
such a highway system The route is
to run from Chicago to Milwaukee
and Madison thence to St Paul A lready
there are paved highways between
these points Possibly none o f
them would be used in the new road
program as the proposed highway
would run in as nearly a straight line
as possible regardless o f the expense 
between the points mentioned It is
more than likely that some towns now
on federal highways may be le ft several
miles o f f the line which the president
proposed to have built 
The cost per mile would be approximately
$2 0 0 0 0 0 fo r a fou r lane
highway 100 feet wide The plan also
proposes that portions o f additional
land on each side o f the highway
should be bought by the federal gov
em m ent to be leased to various con
cessionaires The aggregate cost o f
the highway system is estimated at
tw o billion six hundred and thirty six
million It is expected that the president s
provision in the spending bill
would care fo r about one fourth the
total amount during the first five
years and that thereafter Congress
shall make further appropriations until
by 1960 the highway system should
be completed 
These highways are all intended to
he toll roads and those using them
are expected to pay a toll o f approximately
one and one half cent per
mile The bill o ffe re d by the president
also provides that the federal government
shall maintain jurisdiction over
such super highways to the exclusion
o f state and local authorities It contains
the queer provision fo r instance 
that all federal employees no
matter in what department they are
engaged shall becom e the patrol o f ficers
fo r policing all such roadways 
Those guilty o f offen ses on such
roads would not be brought before
state or local courts but would all
have to be tried after a grand jury
indictm ent in the federal district
courts It would seem rather im practical
to police the highways under
such a system unless there was a
great expansion in the num ber o f
federal courts The idea o f toll roads 
constructed at federal expense does
not seem to be a popular feature o f
the bill but it may be carried throueh
b y other provisions o f the bill which
make it more o r less o f a pork barrel 
measure 
Secretary W allace will commence
the exporting o f cotton under his subsidy
plan the com ing month The
governm ent now holds nearly twelve
million bales o f cotton on which it
has loaned about 700 million dollars 
The annual storaee charges o f the
government is approxim ately 2 million
per month while the interest
costs would add a like sum Secretarv
W allace proposes to o ffe r a bounty
o f $7 50 per bale to the exnorters o f
this cotton to foreign markets the
eovem m ent o f course takine the
loss Also 600 000 bales would he
bartered to Great Britain and H olland
in exchange fo r rubber tin and
other supplies needed fo r w ar preparations 
W hether or not there will
be a real loss o f $7 50 per bale under
this barter plan will depend nrettv
lartrelv upon what prices our countrv
pavs fo r the rubber and other materials 
Tt will be remembered that
the Department o f State has opooced
this barter program arid only a few
months aeo successfully opposed Secretary
W allace s subsidy urogram 
which provided fo r the shiDninf o f
wheat to Bra7 il because it would interfere
with the trade relations with
Argentine In some wavs it seems
that ou r governm ent is going around

A chronic case o f N ew Dealitis 
which o r y places the greatest
amount o e ffo rt where it will do the
least good seems to have afflicted
our baseball artists in recent games 
The ailment reached a peak here on
Sunday night when the Merchants o f
La Crosse were allowed to capture
1 to 0 pitcher s battle from Chucker
Shaw The slender Black River
moundsman though touched fo r nine
hits kept the bingle well scattered and
tightened up like a Scotchman in the
clutches to keep all but one o f the
visiting hosshiders away from the pay
station W hat with the Falls M erchants
reaching a new low in hitting
the lone run proved enough and the
La Crosse nine walked aw ay feeling
pretty chesty 
The score board was blank fo r both
sides going into the seventh which act
was opened with a double to right by
Lawrence who was moved up a base
via Rendler s sacrifice bunt Culp
drove a hot single over the second bag
to send Lawrence clattering into the
home o ffic e with the count needed to
grab the ball game 
The B R F Merchants had men
on third on three occasions but with
opportunity kicking the door in our
swatsmen went picking daisies The
first chance came in the second when
E Rudolph took tw o bases on a wild
heave by Lawrence and scampered to
third on a passed ball The M ajordo
mo was still roosting on that spot
when the chapter ended 
Scoring threat No 2 came in the
last h alf o f the seventh which Slug
ger Rudolph opened with a lovely two
base hit along the line in right Elli
son sacrificed A rt to third and with
only one away it looked like the game
was as good as even but no sale again
and Arthur was m arooned Randles
reached third on a walk stolen base
and a passed ball in the eighth but
he too was left stranded 
Thompson La Crosse pitcher gave
up only fou r hits and had twelve
strikeouts which is good pitching in
any man s ball game The gent built
along the proportions o f a Blair
Swede had a nice smoke ball along
with a sharp breaking curve and fair
to middlin control and them is the
ingredients which are most effective
in light bulb ball games 
Shaw though charged with the loss
gave out even more evidence that he
is a plenty handy guy to have around
to ease up the hurling duties fo r Er
nie who has pitched about 13 ball
games since the M erchant schedule
opened in mid May 
Next Sunday night W hitehall vie
tors over the Merchants in a game
at W hitehall earlier in the season will
be here fo r a rubber game It s
sort o f grudge proposition you know 
The Trem pealeau county seaters have
a couple o f able baseballers in their
lineup who often give the Merchants
some trouble One o f these is this
Garaghan fellow who is one o f the
best athletes ever fetched up in western
W isconsin Other stars are Don
W right who handles the shelalee like
grandpa used a toothpick on his store
teeth and Swenson a ball hawk extraordinary 
as well as a clouting
swatsman These gents rate in a class
with the Rudolph s Ellison Teeples 
Hauser Randles and other Jackson
county stars The Merchants promise
some vigorous w ork with the mace
themselves so the game ought to be
good W e personally promised to
take Teeples over ou r knee if he did
not swat out base hits in the La
Crosse game Robert didn t produce
so even tho it hurt us more than it
did him we applied the score book
where it did the most good Fortun
ately Robert didn t o ffe r much resistance
or our address probably
would at present have been in care
o f the Krohn hospital B R Falls 
Wis W e hope other Merchant batsmen
profit in the Whitehall game by
what happened to Teeples

The leaders o f both houses o f Congress 
apparently with the sanction o f
the administration are hoping to obtain
adjournm ent o f congress by A ugust
5th W hatever may have been
the benefit o f legislation passed at
this session and naturally there has
much good legislation com e through
the mil! as is always the case in every
Congress there will still be left
undone some o f the most important
work The farm ing situation becom es
more and more acute as the price
level on farm com m odities continues
to decline The farm income fo r 1938
was approxim ately 15 per cent less
than in 1937 That o f 1939 promises
to be at least 15 per cent less than
1938 The passage o f large appropriation
bills to promote business activities
might not be needed were the
farm question approached from the
standpoint o f farm income The president s
spending program will call fo r
two billion six hundred milllion dollars
fo r so called self liquidating proiects 
That amount if authorized will
be one half billion less than the actual
decline in farm incom e fo r these
two years W ere farm incom e restored
to even the same basis as 1928 there
probably would be little need fo r a
spending program to aid business and
certainly the relief appropriations
would be lessened

The North Bend mill which has
been in operation fo r almost 80
years was totally destroyed by fire
last W ednesday The fire started
about noon The funeral o f the late
John Patterson prominent resident o f
the village was being held that day
too and services were delayed while
the fire was at its height The mill
was owned by Mr Coleman o f W est
Salem 
The follow ing account was given
last week in the Melrose Chronicle 
The North Bend mill the last old
land mark in the village o f North
Bend was destroyed by fire at noon
W ednesday July 26 1939 W alter
Bourn the present operator was alone
in the mill at the time and it is
thought that the engine which is used
to operate the feed mill back fired 
and flames immediaely spread thru
the structure and Mr Bourn narrow ly
escaped receiving bum s about his
face 
Help was at once summoned and
the Ettrick Fire department rushed
to the scene but the building was all
in flames before help could arrive 
N othing was saved from the mill The
books money in the cash register 
and stock o f feed w ere lost The
estimated value o f the mill was
$3 000 00 
The mill at North Bend was a history
mark in the village It was built
by W A Thomas in 1860 Since
those early days it has changed ownership
many times and at present has
been operated by W alter Bourn o f
Ettrick Through the years o f its
existence it has been a great service
to the North Bend people and its destruction
will be felt in that neighborhood 
A large wooden structure it
burned very rapidly the fire starting
at 12 o clock noon and in less than 45
minutes it had burned to the ground

Rain which has been absent fo r lo 
these many weeks came down in
quantities su fficient to wash the last
fou r innings o f the ball game between
Pigeon Falls and the Merchants
o f f the record here last Thursday
night Up until the descent o f the
moisture the visitors had snatched 3
runs out o f a very messy fourth inning
to jum p to a 3 to 1 lead The
locals however lost no time in climbing
into a tie com ing right back in
the last h alf o f the fourth with a
pair o f runs to even it at three all 
This was the status when J Pluvius
Jupitor got busy on the farm crops
with his batch o f sky juice 
M r L en Ellison o f the Blair Ellisons
and an inmate o f the village o f
Blair is the chap to be thanked fo r
boosting B R Falls up into a square
count with the birds from Pigeon 
The Merchant third sacker pasted a
triple to right and counted on Ernie s
double in the second He came up
in the fourth with A rt Rudolph waiting
on the hassocks and crashed a
double to center scoring Arthur Len
moved to third on an infield out and
scored the tying run on H oard s
ground ball to short Just as the gentleman
from Blair was getting set to
perform m ore great deeds the rain
drops interfered and the customers
and the ball players all skeedaddled
fo r home and other places o f shelter 
The Pigeon Falls fourth started o f f
peacefully enough Rilling being put
away on a third strike A pass to
Humphrey who follow ed Bill in the
batting order didn t seem to give
much cause fo r concern either but
when Teeples dropped Fremstad s
pop up after getting his hands on the
pill on a great play things began to
look up fo r the Western leaguers R 
Hagen was credited with an infield
hit on his bunt to short Humphrey
scoring A fum ble on Tim merman s
ground ball near second put ducks on
first and third M Fremstad dumped
a bunt to E m ie who threw to Hoard
who had E Fremstad at the plate but
dropped the ball when the latter
bowled him o f f his feet Neprud then
dropped the third bunt o f the fram e
in front o f the plate and R Hagen
counted the third enem y tally Rudolph
w ifted M Hagen and Tom ter to
end the uprising 
A fte r the Blackriverites had a
chance to tally a man from third in
the fifth but failed to produce the
drops began to fall The Doves half
o f the sixth in which they got their
only lusty hit o f the ball game was
washed o f f the scoresheet
