         <p>Black River Falls may be one hunÂ­dred years
            old but is a whole lot sprier than a lot of towns fifty years younger. Splendid and
            wholehearted cooperation of all fraternal organizations and of the people made the
            centennial and homecoming the happiest gathering of all Jackson county people and for
            all who came from afar to celebrate with us. To my notion the man who had the happiest
            and most enjoyable time at the centennial gathering was Marshall H. Finney of Melrose,
            who participated in all the Indian dances at the Indian Village, even doing the Calumet
            dance, the dance of competition of the American Indian. I sure did hate to be in the
            shoes on the man in the moon while the fireworks were going on. .</p>
