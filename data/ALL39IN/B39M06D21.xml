         <p>Centennial Soap Box Derby Causing Excitement Among Kiddies
Preliminary Voting on Queen
Contest Ends Friday Afternoon
Main Street to Witness Black
River Valley s First Race
Present Bridge across black river built in 1924
It is very important that voters deposit
all their tickets before Friday
at 5 00 p m as the next tickets handed
out by the merchants will be
stamped Tickets found in the box
after Friday without a stamp o f identification 
will not be counted 
After the nominations are complete
the votes cast will be equalized to
give every one both in small and
large communities a fighting chance
to win the 1st 2nd or 3rd prize 
Those not winning one of the above
will be given a valuable prize however 
The Centennial Queen committee
wishes to call your attention to some
of the possibilities under this system
of determining a winner in the contest 
1 A contestant can receive the
largest popular vote and still lose 
2 A contestant can easly overcome
the lead of another after the equalization 
hence a contestant can not
feel she has a big advantage just because
of a large vote in the preliminary 
3 A contestant may be surprised
in the fin al voting and also in grand
stand ticket selling and still be dis-

M O V IE B RINGS MEM O RIE S
Many have been attracted this past
week to see the movie Alexander
Graham Bell the originator o f the
telephone 
It is interesting to know that we
have in our midst Miss Emma W 
Gebhardt who had personally met the
late Alexander Graham Bell at a banquet
given in his honor in Milwaukee
at the Training School for Teachers
of the Deaf in 1903 when the new
school building was dedicated on 7th
 Prairie streets It occupied onethird
of that building from basement
to the third floor inclusive The
blackboards were green instead of
black easier on the eyes The rooms
were named after various citizens of
Milwaukee or members of the Milwaukee
Phonological Institute The
Alice Chapman room had beautiful
plaques and pictures The object was
to have as beautiful an environment
as possible for the deaf in all the
rooms 
Mr Bell was the speaker o f the
evening and he had his choice of subjects 
As a change he chose the subject
 The Yellow Fever and the Mosquito 
 A t that time Yellow fever
had been a great problem in warmer
climates He was greatly interested
in the deaf and in lip-reading as
his wife Mrs Bell was deaf before
he had married her She was a marvelous
reader of lips 
A fine library building for the deaf
had been erected in Washington D 
C at a cost then of over $50 000 00 
The magazine called The Volta Bureau 
was published in Washington 
D C 
Miss Gebhardt had also specialized
in that work and has taken many a
child and trained it to produce voice 
to speak read the lips and to finish
the grade school and to complete a
high school education the same as any
child of hearing Also teachers were
trained to do that work and to correct
stutterers and stammerers She
had spent years in the Milwaukee
Teachers Training I t is beautifully
equipped with play grounds on
the roof Thus a totally deaf child
has an equal opportunity with the
hearing child to receive an education 
The late Mr Spencer of the Spencerian
Business College was a great
and loyal friend o f this school and
always worked for the interest and
welfare of its pupils A large bust
of Mr Spencer stood on a pedestal
on the landing for years 
Miss Francis Wettstein had been
at the head for years after her uncle
Mr Binner died and her untiring
efforts in behalf of the deaf in Mil-
Nothing that has happened in many
moons is exciting the imagination of
the little folks more than the prospect
o f a big race down Main street
hill in home-made 4-wheel motorless
contraptions of their own making 
A t 9 00 a m on Ju ly 4th the
county s younger and older population
will turn out to fill every nook 
cranny balcony window and rooftop
along Main street to witness
Black River Valley s first race of this
kind There are very few rules Each
vehicle with its driver must not
weigh more than 150 pounds I t is
suggested that each machine have a
name painted on each side with
those entering from surrounding communities
bearing the name of the village
or township from which they
come 
Boys between six and 10 years will
compete together in one race and
 boys between 10 and 15 years in a
separate race Y our rig must be
home-made and must not cost over
$3 00 No glass of any kind is to be
used in construction All unsafe
 rigs will be ruled out of the race 
They will be weighed in on Carl Malchow s
scales at 8 30 a m Tuesday 
and the race will be held at 9 00 a 
SATCHEL P A IG E S ALL-STARS
NOSE OUT W IN 1 TO 0
Satchel Paige and his colored baseball
team have come and gone but
while they were here they plastered
the first loss on the debit side of the
Merchants ledger O f course the
game wasn t all it was cracked up to
be because the heavens sought to
shed a few tears at just the wrong
time Oh that account the game that
would ordinarily have been red hot
had enough sky juice sprinkled on it
to dampen it down to a rather drab
as well as muddy show Be it 6aid
that the Merchants did nobly to put
fire into the battle despite the heavy
load of moisture coming down from
overhead even though it was too apparent
that the high powered All
Stars didn t seem to have the zij usually
expected of a high class ball
team When however their play became
too apparently listless the
wolves in the grandstand began to
howl and loud enough to let the
blacks know th a t folks don t pay hard
dough for anemic baseball The razzing
had the delightful effect of spurring
the game up into a semblance
of a tussle or at least as much of one
as could be expected on a diamond 
ankle deep with goo 
Rudolph s mound work was again
top notch stuff Rude being in trouble
only once in the 8th when after
Hardin Donaldson and Johnson had
singled in succession before any one
had been laid away the half-pint put
the pressure on and allowed only one
to count before the next three were
sent back This was the only frame
in which more than one gent was permitted
to look the fair grounds over
from the baselines 
The best chance for the Black R iver
boys was in the second when E llison
and Hoard singled in order and
moved up on a passed ball before any
one had been retired but the next
waukee will long be remembered 
How grateful we should be to Mr 
Bell and all those who aided the deaf
in life to make it worth while and
easier by thus being able to communicate
naturally with others and to
mingle with them in comfort and
happiness 
m I t is planned that the younger
group of entrants will start at a safe
point about h alf way up Main street 
the older group starting farther up
the hill Every possible precaution
will be taken to prevent any accidents
to the youngsters or bystanders 
In this race speed will not count 
only the distance traveled Contestants
may or may not have brakes on
their soap box A sack of sand is
recommended for weight I t is requested
that as many Boy Scouts as
possible help the police in keeping the
crowds close to the sidewalk 
A ll boys wishing to enter a soap
box in the race between the ages o f
6 and 15 must turn in their names 
age and weight to Harold McGown 
at the New Richmond Roller Mills 
Liberal prizes are to be given to
provide additional zest to the competition 
It is our guess that grownups
will outnumber the youngsters in
the crowd along Main street during
the big race the kids will all be in
the competition The merchants of
the county are asked to empty all the
wooden boxes possible to supply the
big demand that is bound to set in
immediately after word of the big
race gets about 
three men couldn t do a thing so Len
and Royce were left where they were 
Randles opened the game with a single 
Ellison got his second hit in
the 4th and Ernie bashed one in the
5th but the sloppy going underfoot
kept the possibility of a rally down to
a non-entity 
A fter the crowd had pleaded with
Paige to go to the hill and strut his
stuff through eight innings the great
twirler finally ascended the hillock
in the 9th amid cheers o f approval 
What the great guy done was to cause
Teeples to fly to right Ellison to
bounce to his Paige s own glove and
Ellison splash a ground ball to Douglas 
It is indeed regrettable that it wasn
 t possible to play the game on a
dry field so the folks could have seen
some really classy baseball but it
just wasn t in the weather so free
admissions were announced to customers
for the game with Whitehall
come Sunday which we think was a
right noble gesture

that stick end for end like a bandmaster
twirls a baton 
The whole scene amazed me I was
spellbound and when I finally moved 
there was a sound from the male
beaver s tail hitting the water a deafening
whack and away went Ma Beaver 
family and all 
But not so with Pa Beaver He
defied me in his haunts and actually
scared me stiff I made a lunge at
him and he pounded the water with
his tail so hard I could feel my hair
grow I saw he was no coward and
could not be scared so I tossed a
stick of birch at him and he hit that
far more accurately than Babe Ruth
ever hit a curve and the stick went
sailing across the water Still he
came at me he sure was mad I got
in the water and he came at me and
pounded the water within five feet
of me or closer it seemed and I m
telling you I got out of his way and
stayed out! His eyes looked like two
cranberries perched on his head he
was mad a-plenty and brave and
when I got up on the bank he still
kept swimming around and pounding
the water That old boy I repeat 
was fighting mad and old timers tell
me if it wasn t for the little kid beavers
I may never have seen any of
them I was just lucky 
I came in quietly but left with a
lot of love and respect for a beaver
and with a new common sense of
don t get too close to Mr Bull Beaver
or he will phack your hand or
leg off All I can say is it was a
grand and glorious show out in Nature s
waterways a sight a human being
very seldom sees I got six trout
too CAP

Founder of Galesville Visited Our
Neighbor 79 Years Ago and Wrote
a Story of What He Saw and
Heard at That Time
Over in Jackson county they are
making preparations to celebrate the
100th anniversary of the settlement
o f that area Thanks to A D Polleys 
Melrose old settler Jackson county
people o f this day have been made
familiar with the county s history
through a series of articles which
have run in newspapers for more than
a year 
From the files of the Galesville
Transcript Galesville s first neswpaper 
The Republican this week reprints
an interesting article written
by Judge Gale for that newspaper 
Judge uale was continually on the
move and he always had his eyes
open In the month of May of the
year 1860 he drove over into Jackson
county studied lumbering conditions
and pried in to the early history Returning
home he wrote this article
for the Transcript and here it is 
just as it trickled from his pen seventy-
five years ago 
Black River Falls
May 30 1860
Mr Editor The high price of
pine timber along the Mississippi river 
was the first inducement to the
settlement of the Black river region 
Before any permanent settlement was
effected the French settled at Prairie
du Chein and at some other points
along the Mississippi visited the pinery 
sawed out pine lumber with pit
saws and ran it below for which they
obtained $40 per thousand feet 
Jacob Spaulding and his company
were the lirst permanent settlers on
Black river They arrived at the
Falls 50 miles above the mouth the
27th day of August 1839 The company
consisted o f the following persons 
viz Jacob Spaulding Isaac Van
Austin Hiram Yateman Joseph
Stickney Alonzo Stickney Andrew
Wood Robert Wood Robert Sawyer 
Patrick Linn Richard Woleben Jeremiah
D Spaulding John McGarvin 
Daniel McLain Jo hn P Knight Levi
Tyson Joel Lemon and John Angle
Miller 17 in all Many o f these persons
besides Jacob Spaulding have
continued in the country Mr Van
Austin now resides west of the Falls
on Trempealeau Prairie the Stickneys
near the Falls Yateman in Lewis
Valley Mr Sawyer went to Chippewa
river where he shot a man in a
quarrel and was imprisoned Mr Lemon
was killed in 1852 at Lytles In
attempting to snub a raft he threw
the rope around the limb o f a tree 
which broke and struck him on the
head killing him instantly O f this
number Jacob Spaulding and the two
Woods were partners and the balance
their hired hands 
They commenced immediately the
construction of a small sawmill on
the Falls and put it in operation the
following winter and commenced
their largest mill In February 1840 
they ran out of provisions when the
whole party except Jacob Spaulding 
went below after supplies and were
gone 21 days During that time Mr 
Spaulding was the only man on the
river and supported himself by hunting 
In June 1840 the Woods became
anxious for the sole proprietorship of
the Falls and attempted to drive
Spaulding off the river High threats
o f shooting were made 
Mr Spaulding left for Prairie du
Chein where he took out a writ of
Forcible Detainer against the Woods 
and was put back into possession This
was the commencement of the series
o f lawsuit between them which has
lasted nearly 20 years and was only
settled by the compromise the present
spring By this settlement Spaulding
retains the mill and the waterpower
on the west side o f the Falls and a
respectable portion o f the town property 
In May 1841 Spaulding bought out
the Woods and took a quit claim deed
o f the 160 acres including the Falls 
the land being government land held
only by pre-emption and the Woods
left the river When the land was
brought into market by the government 
Andrew Wood saw the advertisement 
went and proved up a preemption 
and got the patent without
the knowledge o f Spaulding The
great haste by the government in issuing
the patent led some to believe
the officers o f government were no
more honest at that time than at the
present Spaulding got Wood indicted
for false swearing and also commenced
suit for the land The indictment
for some reason failed but suits were
prosecuted with varying success until
the compromise mentioned above 
In September 1938 Hon James
O Neil now o f Clark county and his
brother Alexander O Neil came to
the river and commenced getting out
lumber at Pigeon B lu ff bottom below
the mouth o f Robinson s creek 
The next spring they commenced
building the mill above at Perry s 
In the spring of 1840 Robert Douglas
came to the river and after working
a month at the Falls commenced
getting out lumber opposite his present
farm Thomas Douglas his brother 
came in the summer and worked
with Robert 
Jonathan Nichols also came to the
river in the spring of 1840 and during
the summer put up a sawmill at
the mouth o f Nichols creek He died
in June 1851 at Thomas Douglas on
his return from Dubuque 
In 1843 Robert Douglas put up a
sawmill on a creek near his farm 
In 1844 Thomas and Peter Hall
erected a mill at the mouth of H all s
creek above the Falls and Shepperd
and Valentine one on Squaw Creek
below the Falls 
The following year John Morrison
put up a mill on Morrison creek John
and William K Levis another on Levis
Creek and John Adams the third 
on Black river 12 miles above the
Falls 
The Angeles mill was put up
Paul Knight and B T Johnson in
1846 I am not advised of the time
of the erection of Capt Hamilton s
mill eight miles above the Falls but
it was probably about the same time 
In 1842 early in the spring a party
of about 50 Mormons from Nauvoo
Illinois under the charge of Elders
White Curtis and Milles came to
the river to get out lumber for their
new city of Nauvoo Elder John Miller
was the president of the company 
The Mormon W ar commenced almost
immediately after their arrival 
Jacob Spaulding had a claim nearly
opposite of Capt Hamilton s which
the Mormons unceremoniously jum ped 
Spaulding ordered them off but
they refused intimating that the
Saints were alone authorized to possess
the land Spaulding organized a
company of 17 Gentiles who mustered
15 guns and having ex-officio
become captain marched with military
pomp to the disputed territory 
and having drawn up his bristling
columns in front o f the Mormon shanty 
ordered the Saints to leave in 10
minutes The Saints thinking discretion
was the better part of valor 
packed up and left the claim to the
victorious Gentiles who suffered
them to depart with the honors of
war The Mormons then sent to
Nauvoo and obtained a reinforcement
of 50 men and 100 guns which soon
arrived to re-establish the Saints but
hearing that Capt Spaulding had in
the meantime obtained from Colonel
Taylor (afterward president) at
Prairie du Chein then commanding
the U S troops at that place a promise
o f five companies of U S troops
the Mormons gave up any further
hostilities and concluded to occupy
the region jointly with the Gentiles 
immediately after hearing o f the
death of Jo Smith at Nauvoo in
1844 all the Mormons o f Black riv r
either sold out their property or abandoned
it purchased all the guns they
could find on Black river and 73 of
Myrick and Miller o f La Crosse and
left for Nauvoo never to return with
the avowed intention of fighting the
Gentiles A settlement o f Mormons
back of La Crosse and in Mormon
Coulee left at the same time 
A somewhat ludricious scene occurred
at the Mormon meeting at the
Falls before they left for Nauvoo E lder
White was preaching with great
vehemence on the freedom of religion
and closed a tremendous period
with the remark I had rather to go
to Hell willingly than to Heaven unwillingly! 
Paul Knight who had got
excited from being overcharged with
whiskey shouted Then to Hell with
you and attempting to reach the
open door lost his balance and
pitched out headlong 
Jackson county was set o ff from
La Crosse county by on act o f the
legislature passed Ju ly 6 1853 The
county seat was by the same act 
located at Black River Falls where
it has ever since remained without opposition 
Owing to the unsettled title
of the village site no plat of the village
was recorded until this month 
The village however now contains
some 800 inhabitants A disastrous
fire occurred here early this spring 
consuming nearly two-thirds of the
business part of the town The Falls
has been the headquarters of the lumbermen
of Black river from the first
settlement of the county The southern
and western parts of the county
contain much excellent farming land 
which is now quite generally reduced
to a good state o f cultivation 
The eastern and northern parts
contain much pine timber but for agricultural
purposes it is poor 
Vast quantities o f iron ore occur
two miles above the Falls in the Talcose
slate A furnace has been erected
by a German company but as yet 
it has proved a failure and operations
have ceased for the present 
The ore seems to be inter-stratifed
with the rock and contains so much
silex that it is difficult to smelt It
is thought that if it could be mixed
with the Dodge county ore which is
argillaceous it might very much improve
them both The quality o f the
iron is good and the quantity of the
ore is inexhaustible It is easly dug
out with the pick as the slate is tender
and much of the ore parts into
cubes as the rock is removed The
Land Grant railroad passes near the
iron mines and when the road is put
in operation there is no doubt but
that the mines will be successfully
worked and afford a good remuneration
for the capital invested in them

SHOT AT FOUR GOT ONE
By Red Cloud
Duck season opening reminds
me o f two Indian boys who had
one of these old time single shot
heavy calibred rifles with wornout
bore One never knew where
the bullet was going to hit as
the rifle was fired It would hit
one place and then another place
the next shot 
Well these boys had only one
cartridge between them They
had it all figured out that one
would shoot only when two or
three ducks were in a row so as
to get the most possible meat
with a single shot This took
place on Wedges creek northeast
of Levis mound The two crawled
along to a place where ducks
usually light and feed They
peered over the high banks into
the slough and what they saw
there would make any hunter s
heart do somersault Over at the
fa r end of the slough were a
large number o f ducks lazily
feeding This was a rather smart
flock o f ducks for they were on
their guard against surprise 
About 15 feet away on a muskrat
house sat a mallard who
from time to time stood up and
looked in all directions and then
sat down again Suddenly 
 There! There! See! four in a
row! What a shot! The older
boy took aim The other boy
whistled softly The birds raised
their heads Bang! When the
boys opened their eyes after the
deafening roar not a single duck
was on the water Their eyes
opened wider when they saw the

THE B A N N E R - JO U RN A L Black River Falls Wisconsin
E A R L Y H IST O RY
Commencing about the 1st of February 
1869 now 70 years ago the
Badger State Banner then almost the
only newspaper in the Black Kiver
valley ran a series o f sixteen stories
on tne early history of Black Kiver
Falls They were written by some local
resident of the city at that tune 
who signed the articles with the in itial
 K He seems to have been one
of the business or prolessional men
who very evidently came here in the
early forties ana lived through at
least a part of the period ox which he
wrote irom 1839 to 1864 when
Crawiord county His compilation of
Jackson county was still a part of
stories and incidents of that early
time is one of the most interesting
we have ever read 
Twelve of these articles were clipped
from the Banner at the time by
ivirs i owler one of the pioneer women 
who was later Mrs John Keed 
wile of a lumberman at iNeillsvilie 
She careiuily laid them away and
upon her death tney came into the
possession of her daughter Mrs N 
E Gallagher o l 3y r ast Howard
street I asadena Caliiornia I t is
through the kindness o l Mrs Gallagher
in loaning the clippings to the
Banner-Journal that we are able to
reproduce them at this time Chapters
12 13 14 and 15 are missing 
In a few months Black Kiver r ails
will observe its centennial Stories ol
the first years and of the coming of
its first settlers and in particular
descriptions of the locations o f its
first business houses and industries 
are becoming scarce We hope that
readers of the Banner-Journal will
not only enjoy these articles but that
many o f them will emulate the example
of the late Mrs Keed clip them
from the paper and paste them into
their scrap-books that others of fu ture
generations may have the pleasure
of reading them Every school in
the county should have its scrapbook
not only for the preservation of
such old-time stories but also to
make permanent record of the more
important articles on current events
which appear from time to time

River
The First Mill
Trouble W ith the Indians
The Second Expedition
Keel Boating
Chapter One
The earlist account we have of
white settlements on Black Kiver becomes
almost traditionary when we
search for details Enough is known
however to safely say that sometime
during the years 1818 or 1819 an
expedition was fitted out at Prairie
du Chien under the auspices o f -
Rolette a prominent trader of that
place which succeeded in reaching
the present site of the village of
Black River Falls and in erecting a
small saw mill on Town Creek about
seventy-five yards from its mouth 
and just to the rear o f R D Squires 
Restaurant as at present located 
Whether the expeditionists proposed
to locate permanently in this
country cannot now be ascertained 
but whatever their intention might
have been they were permanently
frustrated by the Indians who in
1820 drove the lumbermen off and
destroyed their mill 
Here it might be proper to state
that the Territory bordering on and
contiguous to Black River then belonged
to the Indians who did not
cede away their right to it until about
the year 1838 
The tribe of Winnebagoes claimed
the territory from the mouth of the
East fork o f Black River East to the
Wisconsin River west to Beef Slough 
on the Mississippi River thence
South to the mouth of the Wisconsin 
or thereabouts On the East side
of the Wisconsin were the Menomonies

i he party under the leadership ol
the Woods and Spaulding reached
La Crosse then a naked prairie except
as Indians might temporarily
locate there by steamboat o i which 
in those days there were made two
trips per year to Fort Snelling above
the present city of St Paul in Minnesota 
A t La Crosse Prairie the
party stopped long enough to construct
a Hat bottomed crait called a
keel boat about sixty feet in length
and five feet in width on which to
transport its freight ud Black Kiver 
Perhaps a description of the motive
power used on that class of boats
might be interesting to those who
never saw them under headway Upon
each gunnel of the boat was placed a
running board so called wide enough
for a man to walk comfortably without
losing his balance if sober The
boat loaded with perhaps ten tons of
freight was headed up Black Kiver
from La Crosse with three or four
men upon each running board facing
the stern of the boat and each having
a straight smooth pole from ten to
fifteen feet long the larger end finding
the bed of the River while the
other end was placed firmly against
the shoulder and the whole force ol
the man was exerted upon it as he
walked the running board in a stooping
position from bow to stem and
as the stern of the boat is reached 
the man comes to a right about and
reaching the bow the poies are again
set and the power again exerted For
years after the first settlement of this
country the supplies were all brought
up Black River upon that class oi
boats and to be a good hand with a
pole was no slight recommendation 
as it took a full grown and well developed
man to stand the kind of exercise
described above for four successive
days that being about the
average time occupied in a trip from
La Crosse to the Falls The shoulder
against which the end of the pole
was placed and the back of the uninitiated 
suffered horribly 
Judge Price used to claim that he
weighed 500 a t the end of a pole and
in his usual modest style of keel boat
days claimed that he would outpole 
any living he and make a
boat trip to the Prairie and back
quicker than any man o f Black River 
which perhaps was true or nearly so 
as a few disputed the claim 
But I am digressing somewhat 
The party in question having completed
and headed their boat started up
Black River arriving at the Falls 
about the 1st of August after a
wearisome trip of a week Twentyeight
head of cattle reached here
about the same time having been
driven through the wilderness from

Representatives o f five agencies of
the United States Department of Agriculture
some 35 in all toured this
section Tuesday Included were representatives
from the A A A the Bureau
of Eiological Survey the FSA 
Forest Service and Soil Conservation
Service 
The local offices of the Soil Conservation
Service under the direction
of S J Knudsen was originally the
Resettlement Administration In
October 1937 it was rechristened the
Farm Security Administration Early
in 1939 all the submarginal land acquisition
and development activities
of the Farm Security Administration
was transferred to the Soil Conservation
Service The F S A at the
present time administer rural rehabilitation
loans which in Jackson county
are under the direction o f Douglas
Curran and in 11 counties tenant
purchase loans which provide funds
for the purchase o f farms by tenant
farmers 
The proposed appropriation for the
fiscal year ending June 30 1940 
will double the present appropriation
for Wisconsin which is approximately
$335 000 for tenant purchase activities
in the 11 designated counties 
Under the new appropriation five or
six additional Wisconsin counties will
come under the program The added
counties will be announced within a
few weeks by Secretary o f Agriculture
Wallace 
The above information has taken
us a little away from Tuesday s tour
but we will return to it here I t was

ever since the death o f Mr Levis in
February 1933 When therg is anything
to be done around her home she
does it None o f her friends have
ever questioned her intelligence but
just the same there is one thing she
never has learned and that is that
often you are doing others a favor by
letting them do a favor for you Last
Thursday morning she attended
church She returned home about 9
o clock and found she had locked herself
out of the house She sat on the
porch for a time and planned how she
could get in without troubling anybody 
She thought of a way She
knew one of the basement windows
was unlocked She knew there was a
pile o f wood just below it She removed
the screen lowered herself
through the window hanging to the
sill and felt with her feet for the
wood For the first time her calculations
went wrong She could not
reach the wood She could not get
back through the window and after
holding on as long as possible she
dropped struck the pile of wood and
fell to the cement floor The wood
was only about a foot high under the
window and there was an eight-foot
ceiling in the basement so it was considerable
o f a fall for a small person 
A fte r a few moments she moved
about to discover if she had suffered
any broken bones Three times she
has had a broken arm so she is experienced
in the matter Apparently she
was still in one piece so she climbed
the long stairs only to discover that
the basement door war locked She
went back down carried the step ladder
across the basement which was
some distance as there is a fu ll sized
basement under the house put it
against the window and climbed back
out This time she did what she says
now she should have done in the first
place She walked over to the Holder
home phoned Miss Regina Weibel at
Father Peters and asked her to get
her other key from Sisters Arnoldine
and Melfreda who were conducting
Catholic summer school and staying
at her home She has since been confined
to her bed a very lame lady 
but a very grateful one to think she
was not more seriously injured by her
escapade

CEN T EN N IAL BA LL GAMES
The Merchants Baseballers have an
elaborate program of baseball lined
up for the Centennial program here
on Ju ly 2 and 4 having scheduled the
powerful La Crosse Mint team for an
encounter on Ju ly 2 and the Eau
Claire Pressure Cookers for a game
on Ju ly 4 
La Crosse Mints have a lineup that
fairly sparkles with stars featuring
a colored gent entitled Taylor who is
rated as rather hot stuff at flinging
a pill Beside this dusky gentleman
the visitors have gathered a number
of the best semi-pro ball players in
these parts but we have an idea they
will need em At least it should be
interesting to find out 
The Eau Claire team have a whole
mess of stars who formerly sported
uniforms of the Northern League and
feature a guy named Tompkins 
whose repute has spread far and wide
same being earned on account of high
class left-handed twirling against the
best ball teams North South East
and West of Eau Claire 
Certainly this schedule will give
was lived with those who men they have the Centennial certainly
will not be shy on entertainment

And nothing for friendship was anywhere
spared 
No evil she thought of any living soul ! Erwin Moen came from Madison on
Her life was all sunshine and it shone j ay and remained until Saturday
with out like gold his parents Mr and Mrs Bert
She reflected her Maker
No matter where she roamed 
God s sunshine was with her
Altho she journeyed alone 
Sweet memories do follow her
And the blessing will descend
For in her passing we know she was
everyone s friend 
She was never too busy to chat for a
while 
She was never so sad but she gave
a sweet smile 
She was ever so eager to hear from a
friend 
So Peace to her ashes Sweet Memories

REP H U LL W IN S FIGHT
(L a Crosse Tribune)
Announcement Monday by Farm
Security administrator Milo R Perkins
of the proposed purchase by the
federal surplus commodity corporation
of four and a half million pounds
of cheese marks the end of a sixmonth
fight by Rep Merlin Hull 
Black River Falls Progressive 
Since the beginning of this session
of Congress Rep H ull has been in
correspondence with Secretary of Agriculture
Henry A Wallace and officials
of the department urging that
cheese be included again in surplus
commodity purchases 
Hull also asked that cheese be added
to the eight commodities designated
as surplus foods for distribution to
the needy under the new food stamp
plan 
 Should the experimental program
be expanded Secretary Wallace has
told him careful study will be given
to the possibility of including
other dairy products in the list of
surplus commodities 
The eight foods now distributed
are butter eggs dry beans dried
prunes oranges grapefruit wheat
flour and corn meal 
The FSCC will receive offers for
cheese through June 19 the department
announces and for an additional
purchase o f evaporated milk thru
June 16 It is planned to buy up to
275 000 cases o f milk which would
equal 12 000 000 pounds 
Since January 1935 a total o f 72 -
500 000 pounds of evaporated milk
has been bought by the FSCC and
22 500 000 pounds of cheese since
January 1934 the department states 
Rep Hull will continue his campaign
for the distribution of cheese under
the food stamp plan he says 
MRS AMOS FINCH

June 15 1939 at the Onalaska sanitarium
where she had been under
treatment during an illness for the
past six years She was 59 years 7
months and 11 days o f age at the
time of her death She had been confined
to her bed all the years she
spent at the sanitarium 
Funeral services were held at 2
p m Saturday at the Irving school
house District No 4 conducted by
Rev H A Allison Interment was
made in the Irving cemetery 
Rosie Nutter daughter o f A rthur
and Rosina Nutter was bom September
26 1880 in Crawford county 
She moved to Melrose in 1923 and
on March 31 1931 was married at
Black River Falls to Amos Finch who
mourns his loss 
Three daughters and three sons of
a previous marriage also mourn her
loss They are Mrs Bessie Paulson 
of Rockford Iowa Mrs Erah Stanger 
o f Ladysmith Mrs Charlotte
Johnson Minneapolis Minn Berlie
E Turner Nora Springs Iowa Raymond
Turner Marine Corps San Diego 
C a lifo rn ia and George Turner 
present address unknown 
Mrs Finch was a member o f the
Methodist church She was a good
friend a loving wife and mother 
During the years she was confined to
the sanitarium she had the welfare
of her husband and children ever in
mind and her one worry was as to
how they were getting along They
have the sympathy o f all their friends
in their sorrow and loss 
County Surveyor David Blencoe
had a little experience yesterday that
could have been plenty unsetting He
was surveying in the town o f North
Millston and walking along he at first
thought he caught his foot under a
stick when he felt a dragging effect
on it He looked down to discover it
was not a stick but a snake Closer
inspection proved it to be a rattle
snake I t was the snake s last day 
for they made away with it In all
Mr Blencoe s travels through the
wilds of the county that was his second
encounter with a rattle snake 
When a little barefoot boy blueberrying
he saw a yellow backed rattler
on the bluffs near his home He
never went barefoot again Yesterday
he was wearing rubber boots 
Fred Farmer of Hixton accompanied
by Richard Linnell son o f Mr 
and Mrs Ray Linnell are making an
extended visit at the Farmer ranch at
Frazier lontana Mr and Mrs L innell
drove them as far as Minneapolis
on their way out one day last week
and from there they went by train 
They arrived at W o lf Point county
seat o f the county in which the ranch
is located and were held up there on
account of the bad roads which heavy
rain had made impassable to the
ranch I f Frazier is like most o f that
section the heavy rain will be a welcome
guest Mr Farmer has not
been out to his ranch for the last
couple o f years and it will undoubtedly
be a very interesting experience
fo r his 14-year-old friend Richard 
Mrs W E Abbott o f Hixton has
an interesting memory o f her childhood
days that we doubt very much
could be duplicated by any one else
living here She was a daughter of
the late Mr and Mrs Peter Trudell 
early residents of this city They lived
at one time on German H ill and later
in the house on Price H ill now occupied
by Mrs Rose Clarin Mrs 
Abbott was 79 years of age in April
and so was but a few years of age
at the time of the Civil war Yet she
can remember her father going away
and returning from service She
thinks the reason she can remember
so clearly is because her mother
 took on so as she expresses it She
has another recollection regarding the
Civil war She states that the women
o f the town would gather at the hall 
at that time over what is now the
Frederikson Food Shop and was later
the Badger State Banner office and
read aloud their latest letters from
the front She remembers the day
word came of the death o f William
Moore for whom the G A R Post
here is named Mrs Moore received
her letter on the way to the hall and
opened it to read after she arrived 
It contained her first news o f his
death in action The effect of the
news on the mind o f the little child
that was Mrs Abbott may well be
imagined She states that she cried
aloud as did all the rest o f them 
Mr and Mrs William Kimball the
latter a sister of Jule Walters o f this
city have disposed o f their property
in Meade county Mud Butte South
Dakota and have traveled from there
1500 miles south going through Nebraska 
Kansas Oklahoma and on to
the g u lf o f Texas They are now located
at Port Bolliver Texas where
Mr Kimball is working on a cucumber
farm They enjoyed the trip and
the many sights of the states through
which they passed and had all the
comforts of home right with them 
since they took with them their two
kittens and their dog Don Old
friends here hope that they are going
to like their new location and know
that they will find many changes in
that region to what they have been
experiencing during their years in
South Dakota 
W H IT E H A L L FIFTH
MERCHANT V ICTIM 8 TO 0
Whitehall became the 5th ball team
in the six faced by the Merchants this
year to feel the humiliation that usually
befalls the nine that are fortified
with what it takes in the m idriff
to call on Mr E Rudolph Co for
a baseballing engagement This time
it was 8 to 0 and might have been
more had not the weather man spotted
the Merchants plying their murderous
trade As it was a storm of
no mean proportions burst upon the
ceremony and sent spectators and ball
players alike scampering to cover 
Anyway the folks were shown a sample
of what can be done if the boys go
about it in the right way 
E m ie was sending the Whitehallers
back to the bench with a fine collection
o f strikes for themselvs 14 of
them going out this way in six innings
when J Pluvius intervened as
aforementioned 
Meanwhile the River boys were
having lote of fun with the baseball
club In the five innings at the plate
nine hits were banged out The prize
wallop was a real honest to goodness
triple that bounded off the fence in
right by Hauser in the 4th 
Scoring started in the first a run
counting after two were sunk on a hit
and stolen base by Teeples and a sizzling
single to right by A rt Rudolph 
The generous total o f seven came
clattering home in the third on a combination
o f 5 hits 4 errors and a
pass Teeples lines a terrific single
to center a fine play by Swenson
keeping it down from a triple or homer 
Then Ellison walked Hauser
smashed a line hit to left counting
Teeples a fumble by Warner gave
life to Neidfeldt Ellison scoring 
Rude busted one for a hit into left
and Hauser tallied Randles beat out
an infield hit and Neidfeldt came
home Teeples drew the right to 1st
while Erickson was jug gling the ball
and E Rudolph cashed his check 
That was seven runs and also quite
definitely the ball game although it
wasn t until the 6th when Mr Nature
cleared the premises o f people
with wind and storm 
Next Sunday night June 25 one
o f the best of the traveling colored
teams the Giant Collegians first
stringers o f the Piney Woods school 
will be on hand to see what can be
done about sticking a blotch on the
Merchant record The Collegians like
a lot of comedy along with their
baseball and get more laughs per
game than we did as a comedian
(laugh that off) in circle stock We
hope to get in contact with our old
pal Red Cloud to see if something
can t be done about furnishing a
batch of good weather especially for
Sunday night so you may feel perfectly
secure in planning to be out to
see a swell game o f ball and maybe
get a laugh or two free besides

Marcella Gill Relyea
Hardly a week goes by without
bringing us a new find in our search
for radio entertainment Charlie
McCarthy and Fibber McGee draw a
charmed circle around the dial and
H V Koltenborn editing the news
each Sunday and Tuesday evening
over CBS gets our vote for being
the best news commentator in the
business We enjoy We the People
Speak because of its variety and
the various question programs because
they cover so many unexpected
subjects When it comes to music 
the men o f the family invariably
cling to cowboy and hill-billy tunes 
the older folks search for good oldfashioned
songs the whole family
perks up at the sound of a march 
and spins the dial with one accord
when the program turns to swing 
Funny how names that meant nothing
have become real to us since we can
hear their owners speak Recently
a round table discussion of-radio
broadcasting brought out some very
interesting information as to what we
may expect in the future Recordings
are made o f all eventful broadcasts 
and can be purchased for use
as records on phonographs These
are immensely valuable as a record
of historical events and who knows 
fifty years from now school children
may study history by listening to just
such records as are being made today 
Certainly a recording of Edward V II
making his famous abdication speech
would liven up the study of English
history immeasurably and the opportunity
to hear one of H itler s blustering
speeches would clarify in
youthful minds the events that followed
after Special commemoration
broadcasts could be repeated without
the bother of re-assembling all the
participants and programs could be
played by request just as phonograph
records are now And how happy it
should make the politicians to know
that their speeches have gone down
into posterity instead of into oblivion

 THE MOST NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE in Iso-Vis is the way it keeps your oil
level up and your oil cost down The same refinery processes that make Iso Vis
so long-lasting also reduce carbon-forming tendencies to a minimum make
Iso-Vis unusually safe summer protection for your motor But the quality
that makes it so popular is the way it lasts! Try Iso-Vis yourself and see!

M E RLIN H U L L S LETTER
The Neutrality bill amending the
present law and placing the power in
the hands of the Chief Executive to
direct neutrality as he may determine
to be best has been reported
from the House committee It is even
less like a positive neutrality measure
than what we have It may pass the
House under administration pressure 
but in the Senate a bigger and longer
fight will be made with probabilities
that it will be greatly amended if it
passes at all 
In the meantime Japan continues
its defiance of our treaty rights in
China and threatens to do a lot of
things which do not characterize
 good neighbor nations A large part
of our Army and Navy appropriations
are being expended to prepare us
against future aggressions by Japan 
There is nothing in the Neutrality
bill which would positively prohibit
further shipments of war supplies to
that same country Our government
regards foreign trade and friendly
relations with Japan as necessary to
avoid a direct conflict but Japan
continues to buy the materials here
with which to build a larger navy 
not needed in its attack on China nor
for a possible war with Russia Its
factories operate with raw materials
from our country to produce commodities
with cheap labor to compete
with our own industries many of
which are running only part time 
Without the use of the resources of
America for its wars and its industries 
Japan would not be so cocky
and defiant and ready to provoke our
people There are many who would
like to have Congress accept its proper
responsibilities and pass a neutrality
law which would make Japan
a bit decent in its international relations 
even though American exporters
might lose great profits while it
was being done 
After many months of consideration 
the Surplus Commodity Corporation
will make purchases of cheese
for distribution for relief purposes 
at the same time serving to reduce
the surplus in storage It will purchase
4 500 000 pounds by Ju ly 1st 
and also 12 000 000 pounds of milk 
Congressmen from dairy districts
have been urging the department to
purchase cheese as well as butter for
relief purposes and it is hoped and
expected that further purchases will
be made This form of distribution of
dairy products is not only a benefit
to those on relief who are unable to
purchase such products but it serves
to keep down the surpluses which
drive down the market prices of all
dairy products 
Only a slight increase of consumption
of butter and cheese by the
people would not only use up the surpluses
which bother the markets but
help to restore prices so that farmers
would have a chance to live and hold
on to their farms Were every adult
citizen to eat only one pound more
butter per month it would be necessary
to increase our dairy herds by
two million cows to supply our markets 
I f every family were to use one
pound more cheese per month a million
more cows would be required to
supply the milk to make the cheese 
There is no other industry which so
directly affects the prosperity of the
nation as dairying Still it is difficult
to convince big city people that prosperity
can come from anything except
more steel more automobiles and
more public spending 
The next prominent visitor to come
to Washington will be the commander-
in-chief o f the Brazilian army 
who comes soon The W ar department
is arranging for his reception and it
is proposed to make the ceremonies
approach those which were arranged
for the King and Queen o f England 
The welcoming committee and escort
will be composed o f ranking army officials 
planes tanks and police He
will remain here two days and will
be shown the town and surroundings
by the army officials and then a
party of generals will take him on a
tour of the United States He will be
accompanied by six Brazilian army officers 
They will be shown among
other things the preparations which
America is making for war in case war
should come Just what is the object
o f his visit is also unknown Who will
follow the Brazilian general has not
been published as yet but with the
well advertised receptions o f those
who have come and gone before undoubtedly
other nations will be busy
with sending a few prominents as the
summer proceeds

PERSONAL S
It is worthy o f note that Congress
is about to be called upon to appropriate
292 million dollars for the expansion
o f the air force of the army 
It is proposed to add to the 2 467 new
planes bringing the total first line
air planes to 5 500 Experts including
Colonel Lindberg testify that
America is relatively safe from attack
by air even with its present
force as very few nations have war
planes which could cross the ocean 
But the fever of war preparations is
on and this plan to bring the total
funds for the army at this session to
about a billion dollars seems slated to
go through notwithstanding the unorganized
opposition 
The building of planes is only a
small part o f the program It is estimated
the expense of keeping the
planes in condition and in giving them
proper support will cost 230 million
dollars in 1940 By that time it is
anticipated that the program will be
further broadened The prospects are
that in a few years instead o f a billion
dollar appropriation for both the
Army and Navy we shall be called
upon to pay at least two billion for
the same purpose 
The added Army funds are not all
included in the appropriation for
planes Panama is to be strongly fortified
with an additional Army base 
and the fortification of Puerto Rico
is about to begin Incidentally there
is a housing plan underway for A rmy
officers which will cost 27 million
dollars I t certainly costs money
to prepare for war and in maintainin
g national defense in these times
when the world is jittery and some
nations seem inclined to go to war
upon the slightest pretext The program
for air-planes seems to be pop-

COUNTY AGENT NOTES
Homemakers
Secretaries and Presidents o f all
homemakers clubs in the county are
invited to attend the homemakers
program planning meeting to be held
at the court house on Tuesday June
27th at 1 30 p m 
Miss Josephine Pollock assistant
State Leader will be present to discuss
the different projects including
clothing foods and nutrition housing
and home management and home decoration
and furnishings 
We wish to invite any new clubs
to send representatives to this meeting 
4-H Club
Five 4-H club members and leaders
from the county attended state 4-H
club week at Madison during the past
week This year state club week was
limited to older club members junior
and adult leaders since it was planned
to spend a large part o f the time on
leadership instructions and club programs 
Those attending from the county
included Isla Olson Mary McNulty 
and Eileen Gonia Black River Falls 
Ruby Kutz and Zella Joos Alma Center 
Mary McNulty recently received an
invitation to attend state club week
with all expenses paid This honor
was accorded in recognition of exceptional
work done in the Foods and
Nutrition project as shown by record
books and a narrative report submitted
to the state club office last fall 
Weed Meeting
 Town chairmen and weed commissioners
from the various townships attended
a weed discussion meeting at
the court house on Tuesday June 13 
Mr Lunz o f the State Department of
Agriculture and Markets discussed
the weed control laws and the responsibility
o f the chairmen and weed
supervisors in enforcing these laws 
The group expressed themselves as
being very much dissatisfied with the
recent ruling which placed ragweed
on the noxious weed list Pollen
from golden rod timothy com certain
trees and numberless other plants
has been found to cause hay fever as
well as cutting ragweed before the
time o f seed formation would not
prevent the formation o f pollen 
therefore the farmers o f the state
feel that if the regulations relative
to ragweed are to be enforced they
should be enforced by the health authorities
rather than by the agricultural
authorities 
The fact was brought out at this
meeting that after considerable experimental
work it is believed that the
northern grown Marijuana or hemp
plant does not have the objectionable
qualities as found in the southern
or Mexican plant

B E C A R E FU L O F SUN BURN
 Don t try to get your sun tan in
a day if you would keep your good
health warns the State Medical Society
in a bulletin on this timely
health topic 
 The value of the sun s rays to
health has been recognized by man
for centuries but few of us realize
what ill effects overexposure to the
sun can have on our bodies One
should not expose himself to sunlight
for long periods o f time at the beginning
o f the season rather he should
acquire his sun tan slowly by exposing
his body for five to ten minutes
the first few times then increasing
five to ten minutes on succeeding
days The end result will be that he
will be far more satisfied with his
smooth even tan and will have escaped
the painful discomfort of severe
sunburn 
 An interesting fact is that the sun
tans some people s skin faster than
others Blond people and red-headed
people tan slowly and their bodies
should be exposed to the sun for only
short periods of time at first The
negro on the other hand has a dark
pigmented skin which protects him
from the sun s rays when he is exposed
to them 
 In spite of the warnings issued
each year many people still overexpose
themselves to the sun while on
vacations at the lake and as a result 
return home in pain and suffer
through sleepless nights after covering
themselves with ointments and
preparations to ease their burns As
a severe sunburn may cause death 
immediate first-aid treatment should
be given This treatment is the same
as applies to ordinary burns namely 
common baking soda and cold water 
Enough soda should be placed in the
water so that some undissolved soda
remains in the bottom of the pan or
vessel This solution is applied to the
burned areas by means of a cloth or
bandage soaked in the soda-water solution 
This can be done by soaking
a wash cloth or small towel in the solution
and daubing it on the skin or
the wet compresses o f cold water and
baking soda can be placed on the
burned area 
 A solution of strong tea which has
been boiled for five to ten minutes
and then allowed to cool may also be
used in first-aid treatment The tannic
acid in the tea helps to relieve
pain and heal the burned area When
blisters appear there is danger of infection
and a subsequent appearance
of boils which may result in serious
illness if not cared for properly The
advice o f a physician should be
sought at once 
 Be wise this summer and acquire
your sun tan gradually so that you
may enjoy summer sports to the fullest
extent

Dear Sir 
I wish to call your attention to the
matter of Winnebago funds supposedly
on deposit in the U S treasury
as referred to in the correspondence
from your office as noted above according
to the letter dated April 27 
1939 and address to Hon Merlin
Hull House of Representatives there
has been a shrinkage of funds belonging
to the Winnebagoes since 1930
amounting to $2676 44 As a W in nebago
interested in the affairs of my
people there are certain things I
would like to know what has caused
this shrinkage in this fund who were
these moneys paid out to and for
what Also what has become of the
accrued interest for it would seem
strange that money on deposit should
fail to draw interest I would appreciate
a letter from your office
clearing up these matters as others
besides myself wish to have this information
regarding our property
