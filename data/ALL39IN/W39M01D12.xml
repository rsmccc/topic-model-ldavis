Spotlight on Madison
The eyes of Wisconsin this week
turn to Madison for on Wednesday
January 11 the state legislative session
for 1939 officially opens From
that day and for perhaps the next six
or eight months Madison capitol city
of the state will be in the limelight
Each day will bring forth news of
a maze o f proposed laws and amendments
which the 100 assemblymen and
33 senators will have to decide It is
expected that legislators this year
will find anywhere from 1000 to 1600
bills awaiting their approval or disapproval
Out of some 1400 bills presented
to the Progressive controlled
1937 legislature 442 became law It
is not unlikely that at least another
300 to 400 new laws will again be
added to the Wisconsin statutes by
the 1939 Republican controlled legislature
Republicans will have undisputed
control of the assembly with a majority
of 52 members of the 100 assemblymen
In the Senate Republicans
will need help from the Democrats
with whom they have collaborated in
the past against the La Follette Progressives
for there are 15 Republicans
(the recent death of Senator
Morris o f Milwaukee reduces that
number from 16) 10 Progressives
and seven Democrats
Neither senate or assembly was to
convene until noon on Wednesday but
most legislators were arriving two or
three days earlier to arrange living
quarters and perhaps more important
to meet with party leaders on selections
of legislative committees and
employees
105 Jobs 971 Men
Anxiously awaiting the arrival of
Wisconsin‚ s legislators this week are
971 men certified by the bureau of
personnel as eligible for the 105 legislative
jobs under civil service (messengers
clerks typists etc)
Because a 1935 law compels the personnel
bureau to make certifications
on the basis of senatorial districts this
year‚ s list of eligible candidates is
more than triple the number of candidates
at sessions previous to 1937
and 300 more candidates than were
eligible two years ago
Where formerly only three who received
the highest grades were certified
for a job now the three highest
in each district must be certified Thus
a man rating 56th or 156th in the examination
might be highest in his district
Pension Problems
Perhaps the biggest problem facing
the 1939 legislature is that of raising
money for relief and pensions for the
next biennium Progressives met the
relief and pension problems by assessing
dividends paid by state corporations
2V per cent and by continuing
an increase of 5 per cent on inheritance
and g ift taxes A similar procedure
by the 1939 legislature is impossible
because the 1937 law has already
assessed dividends and gift
taxes through 1941 for 1938-39 public
welfare costs
In the matter of pensions too the
new legislature will have more than
the state‚ s share of federal old age
assistance to contend with The state
employee‚ s association has already
drafted and will present a bill which
proposes a pension plan for all state
employees Then too the League of
Municipalities has announced that it
will present a bill for a municipal employees
pension system along the
lines o f a program tentatively approved
by city officials at their annual
convention last fall
The suggested pension plan for municipal
employees will have two principal
features according to league
officers It will ‚ place compulsory retirement
systems for policemen and
firemen upon a sound basis and it will
provide a sound retirement system for
other municipal employees in those
cities and villages which desire to exercise
the option of adopting such a
system‚
into effect a banking commission report
shows
In 1934 there were 36493 small
loans totalling over five million dollars
granted In 1938 the number of
loans increased to 70500 for more
than 10percent million dollars
The state‚ s first small loan act of
1927 permitted interest charges of 3percent
per cent a month In 1933 the banking
commission was given authority to
regulate small loan companies In
May 1934 the present rate of 2Vfc ‚
2 ‚ 1 per cent was established
Nearly one-half of last year‚ s borrowers
were skilled and semi-skilled
workers Next in line were office and
other non-manual workers and owners
managers and unskillful workers
The commission also reported that
bank loans to Wisconsin borrowers increased
over 2 million dollars during
the past year from  147228644 a
year ago to  149577507

For Rural Students
So that more Wisconsin rural children
may receive an education beyond
the eighth grade a report by two college educators to John M Callahan i
state superintendent of public instruction
has urged that a recommendation
be made to the legislature that the
nearest high school district should
provide transportation whenever ten
or more pupils of high school age live
within an area of four square miles
not included in the high school district
Asserting that 90000 boys and girls
of high school age are not receiving
high school opportunities in Wisconsin
a detailed code covering high
school transportaton is proposed and
recommended to the legislature by
John Guy Fowlkes of the University
of Wisconsin and George S Beery
now of Whitewater state teachers‚ 
college
Citing figures which show that in
some rural areas 60 per cent of the
boys and girls between the ages of 14
and 17 are not in high school compared
with 10 per cent in urban areas
the two educators assert that the fu ndamental
reason for this situation is j
that only one-sixth of the state‚ s area
is in high school districts although all
the state‚ s area is in elementary
school districts
Canvass Meeting With Success

If Jackie Cooper ever seriously decided
to give up his career as a screen

immediately receive a half a dozen

Ever since he was old enough to

the popular star has played
with such leading orchestras as Glen

others
In Jackie‚ s current production for
Monogram ‚Gangster‚ s Boy‚ due Jan
14-15 at the Badger theatre for the
first time on the screen he plays the

CORRECTION
Relying too much upon our own
recollections in writing up George
Gjermundson‚ s obituary last week we
paid that he built what is now the
Plesser building in d ran a restaurant
here for a few years in the nineties
That statement was erroneous in two
respects It was the late George‚ s
tw‚ in brother William who conducted
a restaurant in this village and the
building he put up for this purpose
was the present Odd Fellows building
We remember that when the bank had
it* formal opening in the fine brick
building just completed at the corner
of the same block R W Roberts
owner of the bank invited all of the
members of the four local brass bands
taking part in the celebration to a
treat of ice cream and refreshments at
the Gjermundson restaurant That
was early in the summer of 1894 So
that in the matter of time we were at
least correct

Charged With Burglarizing
Alvin C Vollmer is being held by
Wausau police pending the issuance
of a w'arrant by district attorney
James H larson on a charge of
burglary in the night time Vollmer
is said to be originally from the vicinity
north of Bowler
He is wanted as a suspect in the
theft of an adding machine and typewriter
from the Hales lumber company
office at Birnamwood and will
probably be questioned about the
burglary of the Felts Hardware at
Tilleda and the breaking and entering
of another hardware at Leopolis
An amusing angle of the case is
that the district attorney has in
his possession an ordinary postcard
whereon Vollmer scribbled a memoranda
of errands to do in Wausau
where he was eventually picked up
The sheriff remarked that Vollmer
could not have given a more accurate
account of his recent activities if he
had hired a secretary A 38-55 gun
mentioned on the postcard is of the
same calibre as the one taken from
the Felts Hardware The notations
also mentioned a typewriter‚ Shawano

E D IT O R ‚ S N OT E‚ When opinions ‚Ä¢ "
expressed in these columns they are those
ot the newt analyst aod not necessarily
of the newspaper
A t i n
War-torn China‚ s biggest boast is
her constantly growing national
unity a product of necessity that
has made Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek the strongest Chinese ruler
in modern history But despite this
well-publicized unity China has not
been able to make much of a showing
against her Japanese invaders
Indeed foreign military observers
find Tokyo‚ s paper-thin front lines
so vulnerable that they say 30000
American British or French troops
could put the enemy to rout But in
Jap-occupied territory are 270000-
000 civilians and 1250000 armed
G E N E R A L IS S IM O CHIANG
Time to stop bluffing
guerrillas whose spirit of national
unity is still not strong enough to
inspire a sudden inevitably successfu
l attack
Better than the national unity
argument is the theory that smart
General Chiang has been staging
a fake show of Chinese nationalism
offering a good front at the expense
of his wavering government Though
Chungking headquarters are overrun
with nepotism corruption and
Inefficiency many abuses have been
tolerated to make the outside world
think China is strong In the end
General Chiang w'angled handsome
loans and credit arrangements from
both the U S and Britain proving
the stunt was working at least
temporarily
Not anticipated however was the
walkout of one-time Premier Wang
Ching-wei who celebrated New
Year's by reaching peace terms
with Japanese Premier F um inaro
Konoye Long a silent bulwark of
China‚ s Kuomintang (Nationalist)
party Mr Wang reportedly met
at Hongkong with Japanese agents
and reached terms which would
make him China‚ s head m an leaving
General Chiang out in the cold
Terms  (1) China should open diplomatic
relations with Japanese puppet
state Manchukuo  (2) China
should agree to economic "cooperation‚
with Ja p a n   (3) China
should adhere to the Jap-Italo-Germ
an anti-Communist agreement 
(4) China should accept Japanese
garrisons while the anti-Communist
pact was in force
Interpretations of the Wang demarche
have come thick and fast
In Tokyo happy Japanese thought it
meant a breakdown of the Kuomintang
and the spotlight of publicity on
China‚ s internal troubles With Chiang
weakened Japanese puppet
states would no longer seem pointless
In Shanghai still Chinese despite
its Japanese ownership observers
thought the Wang declaration
was a well-timed Ja p move to
counteract U S and British credits
to General Chiang Whatever the
cause it was a happy day for Tokyo
because China has been showing
hardened resistance the past few
weeks
With the die cast General Chiang
no longer saw need for hiding his
troubles From Chungking came
word of a wholesale purge from the
Kuomintang of some 200 peace partisans
Expelled was Deserter
Wang charged with having attempted
to gain support from military
leaders in Szechuan and Yunnan
provinces
Politic*
When Purge failed when Presi*
dent Roosevelt‚ s favoritism for Left-
Wingers Corcorai Hopkins Ja c k son
and OUphant began bothering
conservative New Dealers forecasters
saw a coming split in the Dem ocratic
party Veering away from
the White House were Vice President
Garner National C hairm an
Farley and Secretary of State Hull
any of whom might be a conservative
1940 presidential candidate
With two cabinet vacancies to fill
President Roosevelt had a chance to
widen this breach by naming left
wingers
What forecasters overlooked was
the always-present possibility of concession
both by Garner Farley
Hull et al and the White House
Result  President Roosevelt has
named Harry Hopkins to the commerce
secretaryship and former
Gov F ran k Murphy of Michigan to
the attorney generalship at the
same time retaining party leaderih
ip 
Roosevelt strategy  U ntil Just before
congress opened the White
House reserved comment on what
every legislator knew was a certainty
namely drastic revision of such
New Deal brainchildren as social
security the Wagner act relief administration
and neutrality legislation
The President also knew such
revision was a certainty but the
trum p card was held back Then
with thc Hopkins and Murphy appointments
apparently due for congressional
opposition the White
House was able to soothe ruffled
nerves by promising he would do
no more bill drafting Consequently
both appointments are being approved
though Hopkins must appear
before a committee investigating
relief irregularities and Murphy
before the senate judiciary committee
to explain his attitude toward sitdown
strikes
What cannot be avoided however
is the feeling that White House concessions
outweigh those of Mr Garner
and other rebels Having committed
himself to a political back
seat while congress is in session
Mr Roosevelt must find some way
to recapture the driver's seat or
risk political oblivion by convention
time next year
Defense
During the World war German
‚ U ‚ boats made naval history by
approaching U S Atlantic coast
cities Last September German
I submarines were still a menace
helping to force blockade-wary
Britishers into the embarrassing
peace of Munich In January Germ
an submarines again made headlines
because Berlin announces her
determination to equal Great Britain‚ s
strength in submarine tonnage
Under the Anglo-German naval
pact of 1935 Germany has this right
under emergency but London fails
 to understand what emergency
j faces the Reich today Now built
 under construction or appropriated
I for are 71 German submarines 
smaller than average their tonnage
is only 31282 Britain with 73 submarines
weighirtg 75904 tons finds
many of her heavy underwater craft
obsolete Not only is London frightened
by Germ any‚ s numerical superiority
if the Reich builds up to
parity but also because Germany
intends to build several large oceangoing
submarines of 1000 tons or
more
This program has tremendous significance
on the international picture
It can only stimulate the
world arms race since England
m ust now build more ships capable
of convoying her ocean steamers
In France where the Anglo-German
naval agreement has always been
unpopular (because claims Paris
London should never have recognized
Germany‚ s right to any naval
strength) the Reich‚ s new subm arine
parity has produced genuine
alarm  Italy always a big *‚ÄòU ‚
boat builder reflects that the combined
German - Ita lia n submarine
fleets can now patrol the seven seas
Convinced that a new diplomatic
onslaught is behind G e rm any‚ s
move certain British circles are
capitalizing on their troubles to win
U S military support Their story 
That Germany‚ s 1000 ton subm arines
are being built to cross the
Atlantic in retaliation for the cool
reception Hitler tactics have been
receiving in official Washington If
this danger‚real or false‚can be
impressed on U S congressmen
Great Britain hopes it will result in
a larger American navy
Science
Outstanding among 1938's news
stories was the growth and flourish
of dictators To casual investigators
this is a new and revolutionary
phenomenon but historians recall
that regimentation is centuries
old By year's end dictators had
 been placed on the defensive at least
in the minds of democratic nationals
in the U S Britain and France
And although 1939 may see more
growth more flourish science has
stepped in with a prediction

Transportation
Last winter's congress tagged the
railroad issue ‚ too hot to handle"
and adjourned in the face of a labor
crisis Since then the crisis has
been smoothed but only on the
promise to both railroads and their
employees that the new congress
will give better co-operation First
step in the right direction was the
report of a six-man managementlabor
committee which asked  (1)
regulation of all transportation by
the interstate commerce commission 
(2) creation of an independent
transportation board to handle all
other regulations  (3) creation of a
federal transportation court  (4) repeal
of the controversial long-andshort-
haul clause
As congress rolls up its sleeves
once more as observers discover
the only unanimity lies in undesirability
of government-owned railroads
four men make rail news
either by speaking or by keeping
quiet 
President Roosevelt The adm inistration's
much-advertised 1939 legislative
motto is "L e t Congress Do
It‚ which means that less White
House pressure is being exerted on
law makers Though the Preaident
appointed the management-labor
committee though its report was
made to him  he apparently believes
broad recommendations are enough
Details of U S transportation reorganization
are being left for joint
senate-house ironing
Sen Burton K Wheeler C hairm
an of the senate's interstate commerce
committee Montana‚ s Wheeler
is the individualist who fought
President Roosevelt‚ s court reform
bill Definitely a nonconformist Mr
Wheeler has promised to co-operate
with the White House but he calls
the management-labor report merely
a "working basis‚ Planks in the
Wheeler rail program  (1) no repeal
of the long-and-short-haul
clause (which prevents roads from
charging a lower rate for a long
haul than for a short haul over the
same route in the same directio n) 
(2) financial cleanup of railroads
even though it necessitates drastic
measures to scale down top-heavy
structures  (3) no government loSns
to railroads at 2 per cent unless sim ilar
concession is m ade to other industries

JOHN A HASTINGS
Coast to ctMist for a 15 bill
committee hearings The Lea idea 
That competing transportation media
provide a far more basic problem
than the railroad issue alone
John A Hastings Not seriously
considered but signifying how far
afield railroad relief proposals can
go is the ‚Äò plan for postalized transportation‚
evolved by former New
York State Senator Hastings and
introduced last congress by North
Dakota‚ s Rep W illiam Lemke The
Hastings idea  "Application to passenger
and freight services of the
rate principle successfully sought
and profitably employed for a hundred
years in first class m ail carriage
   ‚ The U S would be
divided into nine railroad regions
with five types of passenger service
From New York to San Francisco
by coach would cost  5 Sample
fares by class from Manhattan to
Chicago  coach  1  parlor car  3 
local sleeper  5  express reserved
 10  de luxe limited  15 Not entirely
unsympathetic with the Hastings
plan Senator Wheeler surprised
debunkers of postalization by
asking the interstate commerce
commission for an opinion on its
feasability
WASHINGTON‚Individual senators
and representatives and for
that m atter congress as a whole
would like to throw the White House
rubber stam p in the wastebasket
this session but the Democratic
m ajorities‚still large in both house
and senate despite the slaughter on
last election day‚do not want to
throw aw ay with it the key to
continuance in power and to patronage
The real question is just how
m any White House recommendations
Capitol H ill
can kick around
without upsetting
the applecarts of ind
ividual house and
senate members in
their own renomina-
1 tion and re-election
I  J campaigns It will
 J be rather a nice
question of judgment
in many instances
particularly
for the large southe
r n c o n s e r v a t i v e
bloc and for northern and western
Democrats who for one reason or
another do not like Franklin D
Roosevelt or the New Deal or the
p articular New Dealers who are
close to the throfie
The hearings that are to come on
the confirmation of Harry L Hopkins
will be rather revealing in this
connection Hopkins has not too
many friends on Capitol Hill And
some of his best friends and w arm est
supporters may not be inclined
to get their fingers burned too badly
in defending h im  Not that there
is any real question at the moment
of Hopkins‚  being confirmed
He will be But there will be considerable
pelting first
For instance consider the dilem m
a that will confront the Democratic
leader of the senate Alben
Barkley who fought to the death on
the floor of the senate last spring
to prevent any hamstringing of the
political activities of the WPA under
Hopkins and who benefited by
the political support of WPA in his
fight for renomination probably
more than any other candidate in
1938
Barkley Was Hurt Pretty
Badly by WPA Business
But the consensus is that Barkley
was hurt pretty badly‚as far as
his reputation outside Kentucky is
concerned‚by that WPA business
If Barkley were not in his own
heart a candidate for the presidency
in 1940 he could afford a
renewal of the scandal But as
it stands B a rk le y  would like the
country to forget how on the floor
of the senate he defended the use
of WPA in politics because it was
necessary to meet the use of state
employees on the other side
It will be found unless a good
m any minds change between now
and then that few stones will be
put in the path of those who wish
to do a lot of dirty linen washing
over Hopkins‚  confirmation At
least few stones will be put there
by senators The White House of
course and Hopkins‚  host of friends
in the left wing of the New Deal
will try to move heaven and earth
However there is no indication that
anyone around the senate will pay
much attention to efforts that H arold
Ickes Tommy Corcoran and Ben
Cohen m ay make to protect their
friend
Even the senators who are still
for the President do not all like
his left wing lieutenants There is
the question of believing the best
Democratic stragegy looking toward
1940 is for a slight turn to
the right as predicted by Gen Hugh
S Johnson There is the old fact of
human nature that loyalty lies to
the king but not to the king‚ s m in isters
Alcohol an Substitute
For Gasoline Is I  Again
Agitation for substitution of alcohol‚
in part‚for gasoline and thus
providing a largely increased m a rket
for corn is with us again but
is not likely to get anywhere
On the surface the idea is very
appealing Farmers could turn from
other crops to corn thus relieving
not only the com-hog surplus but
also the surplus in the other crops
from which the farm ers would turn
to corn It is easy to figure out
from department of agriculture figures
that virtually all the overproduction
of farm crops in the country
would thus be ended
This would elim inate the  400-
000000 a y e a r now being paid fa rm ers
not to raise specific crops
According to the bureau of chemistry
a n d soils and this finding is
supported by an im p a rtia l survey
which is soon to be published in detail
the idea is not so sound economically
as might be expected
In the first place the survey establishes
to its own satisfaction at
least that blending the proposed
quantity of corn-produced alcohol
with gasoline would make the cost
of this mixture two cents a gallon
more than gasoline This it is estimated
would cost  440000000 a
year which might be financed either
by increasing the price of gasoline
to consumers or by the governm
ent‚ s subsidizing the whole move
in the interest of agriculture
Assuming the latter the government
would be only  40000000 in
the red by the operation as compared
with present farm subsidies
But that is only part of the picture
In the first place the governm
ent m ig h t have to come to the
relief of the oil industry
Motor-Car ami Truck Users
Would Let Out Big Hou l
Again the idle capacity of the alcohol
industry which is about 250-
000000 gallons a year is only onetenth
of what would be necessary to
supply a 10 per cent blend of alcohol
and gasoline for the motorists
So a capital investment of some
 300000000 would be required to
provide the necessary facilities
Then it would seem likely that
the motor-car and truck users of the
nation would let out plenty of complaints
if the proposed blend were
forced on them by government fiat
A road test was conducted this year
by the American Automobile association
in co-operation with the U
S bureau of standards This revealed
that the proposed 10 per cent
alcohol blend would be nearly 5
per cent less efficient than straight
gasoline
What the big trucking companies
would have to say about this can
be imagined and it so happens
that for some time they have been
organized politically and needless
to say would make their views
known on Capitol Hill
Politics May Complicate
R ational Defense Problem
Presidential politics promises to
complicate the national defense situation
amazingly Actually the fight
will be led on the one side by Louis
A Johnson assistant secretary of
war and on the other by Sen Bennett
C ham p Clark of Missouri
Johnson will fight for prodigious
appropriations and authorizations
For example he wants 10000 a irplanes‚
for the arm y alone O f these
he figures about 3500 will be necessary
for training so that the 10000
would yield a net of only 6500 fighting
planes
C lark will lead the fight against
any such heavy appropriations He
will demand  Why are they necessary?
What good will they be after
a couple of years when they are
obsolete? And so on down the line
The interesting part of the situation
is that neither of the two men
who will thus be
limelighted before
Ja n u ary is over as
the champions of
the tw‚ o sides are
President Roosevelt‚ s
own choice for
his successor in the
White House and
yet both will use this
fight as the stepping
stone toward that
big job
Shrewd observers
figure that no m atter
how im portant Harry L Hopkins
may make his job as secretary of
commerce it will be completely
blanketed as far as publicity is concerned
by national defense In fact
some point out the better job Hopkins
does as secretary of commerce
the less publicity he will get It
isn‚ t a page-one story to do something
to smooth the path of business
or to lighten its load But it‚ s
a first-page story to scare the country
about the possibility of the dictators
coming over here from Jo h nson‚ s
angle and it‚ s also a firstpage
story to attack the munitions
makers as inspiring all the ballyhoo
for national defense heavier
taxes and endangering getting this
country into w ar‚especially the latter
And that will be C iark‚ s bid for
the spotlight
Widespread Feeling for
More National Defense
On the whole congress is willing
to go very far with the President
on national defense It doesn‚ t think
very much of the contention that
this would provide employment and
therefore lighten the relief burden
In fact congress will be told that
the chief lim it on the amount of
money that can be spent for national
defense is the scarcity of
skilled mechanics Unemployed
more or less shiftless individuals
can be of little use in an a rm a ment
program And actually the
shipyards the gun plants and the
airplane factories are all reporting
that they are having the greatest
difficulty in getting the men they
need right now
As a matter of fact it is common
knowledge in Washington that the
navy would like to put a great many
more men to work immediately in
its gun factory but simply cannot
get properly trained men
But congress on the whole is for
more national defense More sections
of the country are aroused
than ever before Congressmen will
be found voting for big defense appropriations
who a few years ago
were regarded as staunch little navy
men if not pacifists The reason
is simple Their districts have
changed and they are voting in
accord with the new sentiment

the week-end also curious about H a le ‚ s reactions
He told himselt he disliked bis
housemates He disliked Halcyon
Camp Most of all in that moment
he thought he disliked Casper
Kneeland Kneeland could and
should he reflected have left all
that to Hale's sense of his social
obligations as a guest N aturally he
would have done his best But to
be under orders as an official entertainer
and of such a group as
this one around h im  was different
There was something ghastly in its
humor Kneeland read his thoughts
‚ Don‚ t get restless‚ he said
This assignment is between you
and me No one else will know anything
about it Officially you‚ re my
home secretary You can give color
to that by spending an hour or two
a day in this study You can write
your own letters in here But the
m ain th in g " he went on straightening
suddenly and speaking with a
may be just  harmless bunch of
hangers-on getting what they can
out of me Perhaps I'm only a meal
ticket to them Perhaps I ‚ m getting
rattled and suspicious Anyway‚
he smiled with an efTort ‚ they're
not being the gay little group a m an
would choose for a house party‚
‚ No they‚ re not" Hale agreed
Kneeland stood brooding for a moment
He seemed to have forgotten
the contract game Suddenly
he threw up his head with a gesture
oddly like Hosanna's Both
Hale reflected might have inherited
it from some Indian-fighting New
England ancestor
‚ I ‚ m going to treat you like a fa ther‚
he ended with his best smile
‚ I ‚ m going to refer sentimentally
to old times and old ties Perhaps
I ‚ ll slop over a little What I want
is to rub into these people the fact
that you‚ re my godson and the son
C H A PT E R I I I ‚Continued
‚ Who‚ s worried?‚ asked Kneeland
‚ You are sir if I may say so
So- is your son So is your niece
Y our sister isn‚ t I fancy At least
there‚ s no suggestion of it‚ replied
Hale
Kneeland made a quick gesture
‚ It any worry trotted up to Hosanna
it would trot off again with
its tail between its legs She
wouldn‚ t even know it had been
there Hosanna's a pink sofa cushion
Always has been always will
be But what do you think of her
friend Mrs Spencer Forbes?‚
‚ Cold as ice hard as nails m ildly
amusing and not worried about any
thing She enjoys seeing other people
worry though I ‚ m not sure
she wouldn‚ t enjoy seeing them suffer
physically She and Ainsworth
m ig h t have had a great time if they
had lived during the Spanish inquisition
and could have watched the victim
s ‚
"Ainsworth yes I don‚ t know
m uch about Mrs Spencer Forbes
though she's been with us ofT and on
for years I guess you‚ re right
about her I hear you and Ainsworth
were at school together What
sort of cub was he? A bully of
course‚
‚ He m ay have been at the cub
stage‚ Hale agreed ‚ He was doing
post-graduate work when we
were at Cornell He was a wellbehaved
young m an and very studious‚
"Surely he wasn‚ t popular?‚
‚ No But there was no special
reason for his unpopularity beyond
his superior manner and his habit of
saying anything rude he wanted to
He prided himself on that It's another
trait he has in common with
Mrs Spencer Forbes She's a better
sport She's willing to take as
much as she gives Ainsworth isn‚ t
He wants to ride over people roughshod
and have others treat him as
tenderly as they would a baby The
best way to handle him I should
say‚ Hale added deliberately
‚ would be to give him as good as
he sends He couldn‚ t take it He'd
crum ple under it‚
‚ God I ‚ d like to see him crum ple‚
Kneeland broke in fiercely
‚ But I ‚ m no good at what you young
folks call repartee Never wcs‚
‚ Then why‚ ‚ Hale checked the
question Kneeland finished the query
for him
"W h y the devil do I have him
around? For just one reason in the
world m y boy Because I can‚ t
help myself I ‚ d boot him from
here to New York if I could‚ he
went on longingly ‚ I ‚ d enjoy every
kick But‚well I can‚ t That‚ s
all there is to it‚
‚ You don‚ t m ean‚‚ Rex stopped
again‚Kneeland had started this
‚Ä¢n d he m ust have a reason for doing
so‚then continued ‚ You don‚ t
mean that the fellow Is trying anything
in the nature of blackm ail
on you?‚ he ended
‚ No not exactly One m ig h t call
it something like that but I guess
not That would hardly fit‚ But
don‚ t le t‚ s talk about it Here's what
I started to sav I told you I had a
job for you I have You can write
a few letters fur me but there won‚ t

Hale began to see the light and
to object mentally to what he saw
‚ Your real jo b ‚ Kneeland ended

people are ‚
‚ O h‚ Hale repeated the word
blankly ‚ You m ean am ateur detective
work? You mean that I ‚ m to
worm myself into their confidence‚‚
‚ Nothing like it‚ Kneeland interrupted
sharply " I n the flrst place
m y lad you couldn‚ t get into their
confidence They're not a confiding
bunch Moreover they‚ re not talking
about their little plans They're
just working at them ‚
‚ Little plans? Do you know what
those little plans are?‚
‚ O f course I don‚ t  " Kneeland
jerked out impatiently ‚ If I did
why would I be asking you to look
into things? I only suspect that Ainsworth
Craig and Mrs Forbes are
up to something I believe they
have axes to grind and that they're
very busy grinding them
‚ These people are guests in my
house They're eating my bread‚
and in one way or another I ‚ m
afraid they're trying to do me dirt
It may be in some trivial thing or
it m ay not If they‚ re playing some
skin game on me am I or am I
not justified in asking you to help
me to find out what it is? They‚ re
after something‚my money no
doubt Perhaps they're helping
Ainsworth Are you or are you not
justified in pitting yourself against
them if you‚ ve got the ability to do
it? ‚
‚ I think you are‚ and I guess I
am ‚ Hale said slowly
‚ Good Will you tackle the jo b ? ‚
‚ Yes sir I w ill‚
‚ Fine As to salary we'll say a
hundred a month and expenses till
I get here in August More after
that when there's more to do A
good bonus at the end of the sum mer
if you‚ ve succeeded in unearthing
anything I don‚ t know Expenses
paid of course You‚ ll have to take
trips to New York to find out some
things about Ainsworth's recent activities
and C raig‚ s I ‚ ve looked
up Ainsworth‚ s professional record
but you can find out more than I
can about his private life Mrs
Spencer Forbes may be in it too
perhaps I don't know You‚ d better
decide that yourself All satisfactory
so fa r? ‚
‚ Quite sir But don‚ t imagine that
I ‚ m one of those super detectives
you read about in mystery stories‚
‚ I hope you're not What we want
Is observation You‚ ve got it We
want common sense You've got
that We want some brains and
you seem to have th em "
Kneeland heaved himself out of
his chair
"N ow let's go back to the bunch
and play contract‚ he suggested
He hesitated then added abruptly
" I may be ali wrong about these
suspicions of mine except in Ainsworth's
case He and I understand
each other all right The others
of my best friend You're at loose
ends for the moment owing to the
depression I ‚ m giving you a little
job and a restful summer for old
times' sake Then they won‚ t be
suspicious See?‚
‚ Perfectly You‚ d make a pretty
good detective yourself sir But
there are a few leading questions
I ‚ d like to ask May I ? ‚
" O f course Fire aw ay‚
‚ Is it true that your son is in love
with Miss Kneeland and wants to
m arry her?‚ 
"Y e s it is He's asked her a
dozen times He told me so‚
"H a s she refused h im ? ‚
"O f course she has or he wouldn't
have kept on asking her‚
It was plain that Casper Kneeland
was not as much pleased with his
young frfcnd as he had been a few
minutes before His manner was
truculent
‚ Is he very much cut up by her
refusals?"
‚ Of course he is‚confound you‚
" I don't see why you should mind
answering these questions sir Isn't
it true that part of the tension one
notices in him may be due to the
relations between those two‚to her
refusals and his disappointment?‚
‚ Yes it is " Kneeland admitted
more calmly ‚ In fact I thought at
first it was just that‚
‚ What changed your opinion?‚
‚ I t didn't fit ln with Bert‚ s character
He's in love with Joan He
has been for years But he isn‚ t the
sort to moon around and make her
life a burden because she turned
him down He‚ s a better sport than
that He might keep on trying but
not if it worried or annoyed Jo a n "
He hesitated then went on
‚ Bert‚ s a big puzzle to m a thia
summer He graduated from
Princeton a year ago this month
and he loafed here all last summer
O f course I expected that he would
come into the factory in the fall
He's no young Napoleon of Industry
but he‚ s no fool either He
could be mighty useful to me at
the factory I was looking forward to
it Everything seemed to be going
all right till he brought his friend
C raig here last August After that
he changed completely He thought
he wanted to go in for medicine
Craig has filled him up with that
idea He asked Craig here for tha
summer and Bert himself has been
mooning around ever since To ba
frank what I suspect Craig of ia
using his influence with Bert to
keep him in the medical game I
think Bert has lost interest in it I
even think he has lost a lot of interest
in Craig He certainly goes
off by himself day afte r day while
Craig works in the laboratory But
Craig has no idea of being shaken
off Perhaps he has dreams of
Bert's building a hospital for him
some day when he‚ s a rich m an I
don't know I d on 't know anything
I only guess But my plan has always
been to give my boy his head
I can't put him into leading strings
now‚
Hale nodded sympathetically and
waited But Kneeland had said all
he had to say Rex suspected that
he was regretting his frankness He
asked conversationally " I s Craig in
love with Miss Joan too?‚
Kneeland seemed relieved by the
change of subject
"H e aays he is You can form
your own conclusions Anyway she
has turned him down cold She's
fond of Bert She loves h im like a
brother That‚ s part of the trouble
They were brought up like brother
and sister No romance there on
her part But she doesn't like Craig
a little b it‚
‚ How about Ainsworth? I suppose
lie's in love with Miss Kneeland
too"
‚ He m ade a little drive for her
but not a serious one She gave 
h im his walking papers at tha first
sign of it Since then he hasn't
bothered her Ainsworth is in love
with himself and his schemes He
doesn‚ t pay any more attention to
Joan and she detests h im "
‚ All right 1 guess I ‚ ve got what
I want Now I'm ready for your
contract game sir‚
Kneeland was himself again His
ill-humor had vanished
" I f you can remember to say ‚ÄòUncle
Cass‚  it may help‚ he suggested
"A ll right Uncle Cass It's Uncle
Cass from now on Uncle Cass‚
Kneeland grinned and his face
grew young again
"T hat's the stuff" he commended
He threw his right arm across
his new employee's shoulder and in
that friendly position they went
back to the living-room

from which he
r e c e n t l y ret
u r n e d  He
thinks cultural penetration of South
America might be more effective
than our trade and diplomatic missions
in which he is inclined to behave
we aren‚ t getting anywhere
South America has long had
the idea thst we were a nation
of hard-boiled money-grubbers
Any creditable performance in
the arts he believes will be our
best line of export lie said he
found the Argentines most generous
and appreciative hosts
Once they find you haven't an
extra are in your ruff and you
measure up to their standard of
propriety they wear their
hearts on their sleeve
Incidentally Mr Jag e l‚ s singing
makes audiences weep but no one
meeting him ever feels sorry for
him He is a businesslike compact
Brooklynite formerly an actuary
with the Mutual Life Insurance com
pany long before he took his perch
in the old red plush aviary where
on occasion he still hits high C
As an actuary young Mr Jagel
charting other careers began to
think of his own career He tossed
his insurance job out of the window
found a backer sang in movie
houses up and down Broadway and
proved to all and sundry that he
had a voice He studied with Portanova
in New York and with Caladini
in Milan Making his operatic
debut in Milan in ‚ La Boheme‚
he hit Rodolfo's high C with a bull's
eye that greatly improved Italo-
Am encan relations He sang for
four seasons in Italy before making
his New York debut as Radames
j on November 8 1927 He knows
' about 40 roles and 26 of them he
! can sing offhand and on the slightest
! provocation
With the precision and clarity
of a man trained in business he
tells you of the superiority of
our South American competitors
in their specialty of quid-proquo
trade economies Hence
his talk of ‚ cultural penetration‚
isn't just ivory tower stuff
If Secretary Hull could sing as
well as Mr Jagel can talk international
trade be too would
be in the Metropolitan
Mr Jagel thinks we have the m aking
of a grand musical renaissance

Women Must
Utilize Their
Natural Gifts
By PATRICIA LINDSAY
O O M E O N E has said ‚ No beauties
are born all are made‚
And what hope and encouragement
to all women lie in that statement!
True it is that few of us are born
beautiful but persistency in making
the most of what Nature endowed
us with does make us attractive
And after all it is the interestinglooking
woman today rather than
the pretty-pretty who is recognized
and toasted as the modern beauty
The woman who has developed her
natural gifts by being beauty-loving
and beauty-seeking
Gone are the days when one's earnest
devotion to good looks was
frowned upon or when doctors
voiced their disapproval of cosmetics
Today it is considered a woman
‚ s duty to society to be as lovely
as possible and leading physicians
believe strongly that the healthy
normal woman should keep astride
of her times and make herself most
attractive
No matter what your age your occupation
your circumstances you
owe it to yourself as a woman and
to those around you to make the
most of your feminine heritage
Husbands and children alike unconsciously
dote on wives and mothers
who have not allowed themselves to
become duds Proud is the child
who can produce a personable mother
to show his friends and schoolmates
‚ B u t D o n ‚ t
B e E x t r a v a g a n t l
But in seeking beauty 1 do not
advocate spending the rent or grocery
money on expensive treat
ments or a flossy wardrobe No in
deed If you can afford such lux
uries well and good but don‚ t en
courage frowns and wrinkles and a
distorted mind by fretting over what
you cannot have You can exercise
your body into a pleasing fig
ure just as well in your own home
as you can in a costly studio Cur
rent newspapers and magazines of
fer sound advice on meticulous
grooming and body care so there
is little excuse for you to moan
because you have not the wherewithal
for frequent visits to beauty
salons
Every woman‚ s budget however
should allow for occasional visits to

The house of representatives
alone can vote impeachment and
prosecute the trial of an im peached
official It alone can initiate
bills for raising revenue
though such measures are frequently
greatly altered by the senate
In case of a failure of a presidential
election to give a m ajo rity
of electors for one person the
house of representatives is empowered
to elect the President by
ballot each state casting one ballot
During the early history of
congress the house of representatives
appeared to be the more
important body and membership
in it was preferred to the senate
Gradually the senate became
the most important body and the
position of senator exceeded in
influence that of representative

Traces of Townsites of Undetermined Age
Discovered on Isle Royale by Explorers
The history of a vanished race
that once inhabited Isle Royale has
not been rendered illegible by the
forest growth according to George
A West of the Milwaukee Public
museum who with other scientists
conducted an expedition searching
into lore of the island
Traces of townsites of a still-undetermined
age have been found
which tend to bear out the evidence
obtained in long-forgotten burial
grounds that Isle Royale‚ s copper
was mined by a prehistoric race
that made seasonal raids on the
island
"Mystery surrounds the discovery
of three depressions found in the
eastern extremity of the entrance to
McCargoe‚ s cove by Dr Carl E
Guthe and Fred Dustin University
of Michigan archeologists" according
to E a rl G Kirby whose ship
the A labama calls regularly at Isle
Royale on cruises from the lower
lakes
"Bowl-shaped the depression*

placed rock under which was found
a bed of charcoal Pottery and oth

assistants" Kirby said
Commons Public Land
The common is a piece of land on
which the inhabitants of a village
have rights in common says London
Answers Magazine There are
two kinds of common In one the
land has been taken over by the
public generally by a locai authority
In the other the lord of manor
and manorial tenants hold some if
not all of their ancient rights Between
1707 and 1869 something like
5000000 acres of common land was
enclosed in England and Wales But
the public were beginning to realize
that they were losing and in 1866 an
act was pas-ed forbidding further
enclosures in ihe London police area
and an a d of 1876 did something of
the kind for the rest of the country
The amount of common land in E ngland
and Wales is estimated at 1S00
000 acres Commons are moat freer

If you are truly concerned about
her beauty you cannot fail to keep
her mind active and growing What
nonsense to allow her to concentrate
on make-up! Teach her simple
daily groomings Fill her day with
small duties and childish pleas
ures Let her growl Every child
loves to be read to Every child
loves to paint and draw pictures
Think up new activities that will
teach her to be self-reliant and progressive
There is no beauty as appealing
in all the world as a child's beauty
It must be held sacred It must
not be scarred by stupid parents
who feel that artificial beauty aids
can possibly make their child more
attractive I
Body health skin health mental
health are the goals to be reached
Help your child by concentrating
on those She will grow to lovely
womanhood happy in the knowledge
that her parents were wise parents
who did not sacrifice her youth
needlessly

"Coin  to Church NEXT Sunday‚ 
Last Sunday afternoon I hied me
out to take the air as did the milling
millions of the Central States since
the weather was as mild mellow and
satisfying  as any Chesterfield I
frisked about in the snow with my
young family  I sniffed the air and
filled my lungs Then to my ears came
thc rancous screech of a saw SOME
ONE was rawing wood! Suddenly my
pleasure in the balmy day was gone
     
Now mind I ‚ m not a narrow-minded
critter who condemns everyone and
everything I have no ‚ holier-than
thou‚ feeling about my neighbor because
he drinks and I don‚ t or about
his wife because she smokes and I ‚ m
not keen about a cigarette laden
breath on a woman ‚ but there are
some things that burn me up and one
is the desecration of the Sabbath
    *
There‚ s a sign down here on High
way 29  "Go to Church Next Sunday*
Unfortunately that‚ s the case with too
many people and m*xt Sunday never
comes It ‚ s ‚Äò‚ÄòToday the weather is
just right I‚ ll saw my wood this
Sunday and next Sunday I ‚ ll go to
church‚ ‚  A comfortable salve for a
conscience growing calloused Or
‚ Let‚ s have an early dinner and go
skiing this Sunday Next Sunday
we‚ ll ail go to church‚ Sure we can
move picnic work catch up on sleep
this Sunday‚there‚ s always next Sunday
when we can go to church but
what does the Lord say? ‚ Remember
the Sabbath Day to keep it holy!‚ I
doubt if He would approve of the use
made of His day
     
A pastor of my acquaintance had a
letter from an Outdoor Advertising
Company asking him for his opinion
on that billboard at the junction of 45
and 29 I don‚ t know what he wrote
but I agree with the guy who made
this parody on ‚Trees‚  
‚ I think that I shall never see
A billboard lovely as a tree
I think unless the billboards fall
I ‚ ll never see a tree at all‚

1J ITH what blindness do we at-
* v tempt to guide our children‚ s
footsteps in life so often forcing
on them an am bition of our own!
It m ig h t be laughable were it not
so seriously in opposition to the
m a n ‚ s own desires but Josef Stalin
was forced to attend the Tiflis Greek
Orthodox seminary because his
mother wanted h im to be a priest
Young Stalin legally named Josef
Vissarionovitch Djygashvili did not
want to be a priest
Born in 1879 Josef was educated
in the village school of Gori Russia
In his young days he was a
fighter who bore m any a black eye
and he was somewhat of a bully
although he always displayed intelligence
and character At the seminary
he led the other students in
plotting against the authorities and
local railway workers met in hia
room Eventually he was dismissed
in disgrace At the age of
seventeen he joined the underground
dock workers of B atum in
a riot and when the terrorist Bolsheviks
were formed became active
in their movement While attending
a Bolshevik party conference in
Stockholm in 1905 he met Lenin
for the first time
Josef Stalin was arrested a half
a dozen times and exiled from Russia
the last time He changed his
name regularly and returned again
and again With Lenin and Trotsky
he took over the government of Russia
in October 1917 After Lenin
died in 1924 Stalin supporters exiled
Trotsky and through ruthless
executions made Stalin dictator
Josef S talin‚ s life is hardly the
kind of biography you would expect
from a boy who studied for
the priesthood The very fact that
he was forced into religious studies
m ay account for m uch of the violence
that marked his career

I T ‚ S a mighty lucky thing that some cowboys go
* in for deer hunting An Associated Press dispatch
(rom Santa Rosa Calif tells of a unique experience
enjoyed by one John H Mays He shot and wounded
a buck which later charged him Mays instead of
running away stood his ground grabbed the deer by
the antlers and swung himself on the animal‚ s back
Deer and rider galloped away through the brush
Things were beginning to look rather uncomfortable
for dare-devil Mays when an antler broke The gallant
rider fell off and the deer was later found dead
a short distance away Try it some time It‚ s great
sport!

THIS begins to look more
and more like a Western
year so far as the movies are
concerned Glorified Westerns
these new ones will be with
the big studios offering you
good casts stories and sets
with A-l directors handling
the whole thing
Walter Wanger will tempt you
soon with ‚ Stage Coach" starring
Claire T riv o r and
John Wayne Louise
P latt John Carradine
Donald Meek
George Bancroft
Thomas Mitchell
and Andy Devine
with John Ford as
director The picture
was shot at Kemville
C alif and the
story is one of those
things in which an
odd assortment of
characters is thrown
together under unusual circum stances
Wanger borrowed John
Wayne from Republic at no small
cost  incidentally it was John Ford
who discovered Wayne some seven
years ago when the young m an was
working as a prop boy
Cecil B DeMille gives you "U nion
P acific‚ history from a movie angle

which if it even faintly resembles
the stage play of that name recently
done in New York should
m ake you cheer
And you‚ ll see Jam es Cagney in
O klahoma K id ‚ by courtesy of
Warner Brothers It
is said that his characterization
is based
on ‚ Billy the K id ‚
and that‚ s interesting
Years ago before
Hollywood had
whipped up interest
in young Mr Cagney
he was just one
more of New York's
actors doing pretty
well but wanting to
James Cagney do better Mary Me-
Call J r now one of
Hollywood‚ s best scenario writers
learned that one of the m ajo r companies
was about to do a picture
based on the life and adventures of
Billy the Kid and she and her husband
did all they could to persuade
the governing powers that Cagney
a friend of theirs was just the ooy
for the part
He d idn‚ t get it Hollywood d id n ‚ t
know h im  which was their bad luck
Now he has his chance
Speaking of actors who aren‚ t appreciated
brings up the young woman
known professionally as Elsa
Lanchester and otherwise as Mrs
Charles Laughton If you meet a
motion picture producer kicking
himself around the block you‚ ll
know that she is the reason
For ‚ The Beachcomber'* made
by Laughton independently with the
two Laughtons in leading roles had
no more than begun its showing in
New York in late December than
everyone began to rave about Elsa
Lanchester‚ s performance She had
everything! And Hollywood when
she was there with her husband
gave her no chance to do anything
but the bride in ‚ The Bride of
Frankenstein‚ and a couple of bits
Better see ‚ The Beachcomber‚
when it comes your tyay  i t * s being
mentioned as one of the best of the

doing odd jobs and som etim es even landing in jail on suspicion
of vagrancy At th e end of five y ea rs F ra n k found him self w orking
In ‚Ä¢ *ilk m ill in E lm ira  N Y and liking the job and the
town so well th a t he w as planning to settle down
He had even subscribed to a new spaper back in Sham okin and o rd
ered it sent to him in E lm ira B ut it w as th a t new spaper th a t
proved his undoing F o r it not only se t his feet to itching again but
also provided him with the m ost horrible shock of his whole life
I t w as ju st a little p a ra g ra p h  way down in the corner of a

in Sham okin but It m ade the te a rs fill F ra n k ‚ s eyes His old pal
J a c k Hasco so th e p a ra g ra p h la id  had been killed th a t day
and m angled beyond recognition F ra n k felt pretty bad about it
for two or th ree days and thinking of Ja c k also m ade him wonder
how his other old pals w ere getting along And he decided to go
back to the old town for a visit
H e arriv ed in Sham okin about m idnight on F e b ru a ry 14 1929 The
sky was d ark and a storm w as brew ing The wind blew fitfully and the
few people on the stre e ts w ere w rapped up in heavy overcoats and hur-
He m um bled in an outlandish language
rying to get in out of the cold F ra n k pulled the collar of his own coat
up around his neck and headed for the E a s t Side w here he once had lived
" I t seem ed stra n g e to be back hom e ag ain ‚ ‚  he says ‚ 1 had expected
to find the E a st Side im proved but it w as still the sa m e old hole

I saw  as it approached m e th a t it w as a m an and thought it m ight
be som e one I knew As he cam e up to m e I looked closely a t his face
One look a t th a t fellow‚ s face and F ra n k felt his body stiffen
"1 let out an insane sc re a m ‚ he says " a n d beads of perspiration
began form ing on my cold brow My h e a rt w as beating violently!
I was rooted to the ground! And th a t face w as slowly coming

to its lips Yes‚you guessed it It w as my old pal‚my dead

som e outlandish language th a t I couldn't u n d erstan d !"
F a lls U nconscious in T errorized F light
F ra n k fought to pull him self together G athering up all the
energy th at w as left in his w eakened trem bling body he let out
another wild yell and with a leap and a bound he practically
flew out of th a t alley "T hen I ra n ‚ he says "R a n on and on
until everything turned black in front of m e and I slid in a heap
to the ground When I regained consciousness stran g e faces w ere
looking down a t m e When I told them my story they looked incredulously
a t one another said I w as drunk and w alked aw ay
I picked m yself up brushed off my clothing and m oved on‚
A little way down the street F ra n k saw the lights of an all-night
lunch wagon A cup of coffee would go good afte r his experience and
it m ight help him pull him self together He w as sitting on a stool in
th e lunch room sipping his coffee when the door opened and another
fa m ilia r figure cam e in
But this tim e it w as a LIVING figure Baldy W illiam s another
m em b er of the old gang N ever in F ra n k 's life had the sight of an old
frien d thrilled him so "B a ld y !‚ he yelled And Baldy said "W hy
F ra n k H elm ar w here in the heck have you been all these y e a rs‚ And
for the next few m inutes they talked about F ra n k 's trav els but F ra n k
w a s n 't long in bringing up the story of his stran g e experience

As he talked on he saw a twinkle com e into B aldy‚ s eyes The
tw inkle turned into a broad grin F ra n k w ondered why Baldy w as
laughing at him  Did Baldy think he w as drunk too? At last Baldy
put up a hand and laid it on F ra n k 's shoulder
‚ T ake It easy F ra n k ‚ he said "D o n 't let this get you down
W hat you read in the p ap er about a Ja ck Ilasco being killed is
tru e enough but th ere w ere two Ja c k H asros in Sham okin The

T hat sounded swell to F ra n k  hut still he w asn 't convinced
"B u t the m um bling!‚ he cried " I t w as ghastly Ja c k never

Again Baldy sm iled‚a little sadly this tim e ‚ Well th a t‚ s another

a billion dollars a 8 ram which
year T hat figure
of course is only
an estim ate It
m erely attem p ts to
gauge the dollars

I by this com m on com plaint Nor
does it allow for the possible afte reffects
of a neglected cold
good condition so that the n atu ral

One of our outstanding nutrition
authorities has gone on record as
saying th a t in his opinion at least
four tim es the am ount of vitam in
A required for ap p aren t health
m ay bring a good retu rn in
health protection
It is im portant to rem em ber
however th a t the best single
piece of advice th at can be given
regarding diet is to eat m oderately
of well balanced m eals
Helping to Build Resistance
Such a program should include
proper food norm al elim ination
adequate exercise and sufficient
re st and sleep so as to avoid fatigue
Ju st as food plays an important
p a rt in helping to prom ote
grow th m aintain health and increase
the chances for longevity
so does it hove a ste llar role in
the battle to prevent colds
Don't O vereat
In addition to partaking adequately
of the protective foods
those who are endeavoring to plan
a p rogram of living that will help
to prevent the common cold should
likewise guard against overeating
One should also do everything
possible to avoid com ing in direct
contact with persons who have
colds
Through a routine of co rrect eating
and sound habits of hygiene
the hom em aker can go a long way
tow ard helping her fam ily to prevent
colds R em em ber th at here
especially an ounce of prevention
is worth perhaps m ore than a

It has been suggested by a numalm
ost like m agic the way a bit of b¬´ of com petent observers that
lace transform s into a jack et or I w henever the w eather becom es
blouse m asterpiece and even if you
a re not an expert in m aking things
a charm ing jacket-blouse or bolero
as pictured can be put together with
little effort A collection of lace
tops will a rra y you glamorously
w herever you go
A lace bolero does wonders in
dressing you up and does it click
charm ingly w ith last y e a r‚ s frocks! 
It is never so w elcom e and useful
as at the tail-end of w inter when
you are feeling a bit jaded with
d ark dresses and feel the need of
som ething to perk them up T ie
carickm across lace bolero which
you see pictured above to the right I
will sound a refreshing new note for I
your w ardrobe Scalloped all around
the edges it silhouettes effectively
against the background of a black
dress in either stre e t or evening
length
A dress-up jacket-blouse to be
worn with sk irt or suit lends allure
to your form al afternoon or evening
costume You can get the fine
leaf-patterned lace th a t fashions the
jacket-blouse pictured below to the
left in ravishing colors or in black
The glittering rhinestone buttons
com plete the form al look

Prevention Rather Than Cure
Though we m ay not know precisely
w hat causes a cold nor
how to cure it once we have been
stricken we can and should help
to regulate body processes and
help to guard again st deficiency
diseases
T here should be adequate protein
to allow for the dem ands of
growth and to help rep air wornout
body tissue T here should be
enough bulk or cellulose to help
prom ote norm al elim ination And
th ere should be a sufficient
am ount of w ater and other fluids 
for w ater flushes the countless
channels of physical existence as
it passes from the body through
the lungs and skin as well as
through the kidneys and the large
intestine

to include an egg in the
