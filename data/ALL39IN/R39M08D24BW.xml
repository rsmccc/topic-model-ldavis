         <p>Mr. and Mrs. Ray White Wing and children,
            Victoria and Romona, went to pick blueberries at Washburn, Wis. Alfred Big Soldier and
            his family returned home last week from berry picking, because of the crop being poor
            this year. Nat Decorah and his family drove to Neopit last Sunday to attend the pow-pow.
            Violet Big Thunder and Mrs. Albert Big Thunder were visitors at the Wabshagain home
            Tuesday evening. Mr. and Mrs. Frank Storm returned home from Sturgeon Bay last Saturday
            to remain home this time. Mr. and Mrs. Tom Brown and daughter Christine returned home
            from Crandon after a couple of weeks blueberry picking. Also Mr. and Mrs. George Storm
            and son Richard came home after picking blueberries. And now for a smile: Mrs. Leonard
            Hopinkah told me that one day at their home, Dolly (her daughter) said that, “Mama, why
            don’t you lawn the mow?” She meant, “Why don’t you mow the lawn?” .</p>
