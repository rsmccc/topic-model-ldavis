The Ta x Program
Republican leaders of tho legislature
face their biggest task this week.
They have been given a choice of
three tax programs by Governor Heil,
all o f which are designed to raise the
22Mi million dollars needed to meet
the budget requirements fo r the next
biennium plus additional funds fo r relief,
a Bang’s disease program and increased
pension aids.
Tw o o f the plans submitted by the
governor's office place Republicans on
the spot, fo r they include a sales tax.
A few o f the m ajority party legislators
stated that they are opposed to a
sales tax. They point out that during
the campaign they promised voters
that there would be no sales tax if
Republicans went into office.
A gain, other Republicans point out
that while they are opposed to a sales
tax they w ill probably vote fo r it because
there does not appear to be any
other w ay out. The new budget calls
fo r a two-year spending program of
$67,697,432. Estimates show that the
state income fo r the same period will
be $45,217,863. Thc 2 2 ^ million dollar
shortage still does not include any
provisions fo r relief, estimated conservatively
at 4 million dollars. Then
too, nearly all are agreed that the
present pension allotment is inadequate.
While there has been a sustantial
increase in old age pension appropriations,
the number o f pension
eligibles has greatly increased during
the past two years.
Governor Heil personally appeared
at the caucus and presented the plans
to the Republicans. He asked the
legislators to think it over and then
to come back this week and report the
reactions o f the voters back home.
The Three Plans
Plan number one as submitted to
the m ajority party caucus ca4ls fo r
the reenactment o f the 60 per cent
surtax, the 2*£ per cent dividends tax
and the chain store tax. plus a 3 per
cent sales tax. The sales tax would
bring in, according to administration
estimates, 52 millions, and the other
taxes reenacted, 7 % millions.
This would allow the state to pay
28 million dollars back to local units
o f government and enable them to reduce
property taxes. It would alse
make up the budget deficit, supply 4
million fo r relief, 1 million fo r a
Bang’s disease program, would allow
an additional million dollars for the
pension program, and would also
permit the payment of 2 million dollars
back to the teachers retirement
fund.
The second plan calls fo r a sales tax
o f one per cent, estimated to raise 16
million fo r the biennium, a cigarette
tax o f 2 cents a package, a dividend
and chain store tax, reenactment of
the 60 per cent surtax fo r pensions
and a reduction o f normal income tax
exemptions.
Total revenue estimates for plan
number two are 32 million dollars,
which would meet the budget deficit,
allow 4 million fo r relief, a million for
Bang’s disease, and pay back the teacher’s
retirement deficit in one payment
and leave a slight balance.
Plan number three would reenact
the dividends, chain store and 60 per
cent surtax, and also enact a nonessentials
tax on tobacco, liquor,
wines, soft drink syrups, and theaters.
The total revenue under this plan
would be 25 million dollars and with
relief, Bang’s disease and budget deficit
would fall a million dollars short.
Property Tax R elief
E arlier in the legislative session
when the question of sales tax was
discussed its possibilities have always
been based upon a property tax reduction.
It is an accepted fact that only
with provisions fo r substantial return
to local units o f government to relieve
property tax burdens can a sales tax
measure hope to pass.
A long with the tax plan last week
from the Governor's office came the
proposal fo r property tax relie f as
outlined by administration statisticians.
I f the 3 per cent sales tax is
enacted local units would be returned
$2.50 fo r every $1,000 o f 1938 property
tax assessments plus a $250 credit
fo r each teacher in a public school.
Under this program Shawano county
would receive $90,850 under the
$2.50 per $1,000 property valuation return,
plus $46,250 fo r tew h er credit,
or a total of $137,100 fo r property tax
relief. Total tax levy o f Shawano
county fo r 1936, the basis used fo r!
property tax limitations was $686,601.
I t is estimated that the state would:
return 15 million dollars annually toj
local units.
(E d ito r’s N ote: A fte r the foregoing
was written, the salea-tax plan f o r (
producing needed revenue was discarded
in fa vo r o f a new plan involving
other types o f levies and
stiffer rates on incomes.)

Mission Hill News
I An im aginative short story w riter
once wrote a sequel to the Pied Piper
of Hamlintown in which the mother
o f Hans the crippled boy, who alone
was left of all the children, went one
Christmas Eve to the Cappleberg,
into which the children had disappeared
and called to them to return. For
one magic day, Christmas Day, the
children all came back and Hamlintown
was a normal happy hamlet.
Six years ago a piper of a different
ilk piped a sad tune— a most depressive
tune here in W ittenberg and piped
one hundred children with black hair
and eyes away from their school on
the hill— some never to return and
some to return for one magic month
on Mission Hill. Each year teachers
and workers volunteer their services
to make this mouth possible.
Last Monday with an enrollment
which to date totals 87, the Christian
Summer School opened for the fifth
consecutive summer. Most o f the
children anti young people are from
the vicinity o f Wittenberg and T ig e r ton.
Several have come from Wisconsin
Rapids. Oneida and Bowler. We
w'ould like to introduce you to our
teachers and workers.
On the play ground and assisting
w herever a helping hand is needed
are Miss Elizabeth Muus and Miss
Esther Lindelien o f Brinsmade, North
Dakota, both teachers in that vicinity.
In the school room, two o f our
friends from last year are again in
the harness: Miss Olga Baker, primary
teacher, anti Miss Helen Garlie,
Senior room teacher, both o f Eau
Claire, Wis. Miss Edna Berg, who is I
from Reeder, North Dakota (not
Brookings, S. D.. as was state»d last
w eek), is teacher to the upper primary
and Eugene Hanson, o f Iola, teaches
the Intermediate room (M rs. Sihler
has been teaching in that room this!
w eek.) Rev. Sihler and Mr. Wold are j
in charge o f the confirmation and post
confirmation or Bible classes. There
are 25 young people in the confirma- j
tion class this year and quite a number
o f those who were confirmed last
year anti the year before are back in
the Bible class.
Miss Mathison and Miss D. B erg are
g irls’ matron ami Mrs. Wold is boy’s
matron.
W ittenberg friends would feel very
much at home in the kitchen for they
would meet fam iliar faces: Mrs. Swenson,
cook; Miss Selma Matlson, dining
room g irl; Luella Knutson, baker.
Our theme for this year’s work is
“ Children o f God,” under which we
take up a study o f the Sacraments and
o f our responsibilities as “ Children of
God.”
W e asked one of our big boys this
evening how he liked school. “ Fine,”
he replied heartily. “ What do you like
best?” we asked. “ B est?” he queried
in surprise. “ Why I guess I like
school best.”
“ And I like everything about being
here,” a Bible class girl said quickly.
W e hope our young people will continue
to enjoy being with us. W e are
so happy to have them!
Mrs. Eugene Wabashagain visited
school Monday morning.
Tue»sday afternoon the staff enjoyed
an impromptu party celebrating Miss
G arlie’s birthday.
Mrs. Eunice Peterson has assisted
Mrs. Sihler this week while she was
teaching the children in the In termediate
grades.
Mr. and Mrs. Waldo Wold arrived
late Saturday night from Chicago
where they spent several days.
The Misses Muus and Lindelien arrived
Saturday. Miss Muus once

Some one gained entrance to the
warehouse room o f the local railroad
station Thursday evening and took the
first-class mail pouch that was left
there at 6:00 o’clock to be picked up
by the mail clerk on the evening
train. The pouch was rifled o f its
contents and later found empty in the
cedar yard across the tracks from the
station. The burglary was committed
between the coming o f darkness and
the arrival o f the train at a little bej
fort* 10:00 o’clock. The pouch con-
| tained all o f the first-class mail deposj
ited at the postoffice during the a fternoon
and was, as usual, the day’s
heaviest despatch. According to
regulations, there was no reeistered
mail in the stolen pouch, fo r this class
of mail is despatched only on daylight
trains. The loot in the way o f cash is
believed to have been very little, if
any, but many checks are now known
to have heen in the pouch. Whether
the burglar will try to cash any of
these checks remains to be seen.
Entrance to the depot warehouse
was accomplished by the removal o f
the lock staple in the warehouse door.
The staple was driven back into place
after the door had been closed again
following the robbery, which fact made
it difficult at first to discover how the
robber had managed to get inside.
Federal operatives came within a
few days to investigate the robbery
and are now busy on the case.

Mr. Avenol prevented Russia's
ambassador to G reat Britain, Ivan

protest against Czecho-Slovakia’s

the council to postpone any discussion
of Albania until next September.
H ow ever, even as the League

a word-m incer, Soviet Russia has
enough dislike for powder-puff diplom

T o test this theory, N ew Y ork 's
Tw entieth Century Fund broke down
the $38,500,000,000 which U. S. consumers
paid in distribution costs for
their m erchandise during the peak
y ea r o f 1929. Individual figures and
percentages of the distribution cost: '
W holesalers ....(1 8 % )$ 7,000,000,000

M anufacturers (24% ) 9,100,000,000
Transportation (23% ) 8,800,000,000
Miscellaneous ( 2% ) 1,000,000,000
Basic conclusions w ere that wholesalers
did not earn excessive profits
in 1929 (groceries, 1.3 per cent; con- j
fectioneries, 2.2 per cent; dry goods,
2.7 per cent), and that they remain
an essential link in the distribution
machine.

T o freedom -loving but undemonstrative
U. S. patriots, the trouble

CARTER FIELD
Senator Harrison decides
to risk a battle wilh the President
over revision of taxes
. . . President still hopes to
prevent action . . . Sooner or
later congress will take profits
out of war . , . Opinion in
Washington is that President
could force his ou'n renomination,
but that he could not
be re-elected.
W A S H IN G T O N .-P r e s id e n t Rooseve
lt is on the defensive, with congress
ca rryin g the ball for tax revision
that w ill encourage business.
C apitol H ill is follow ing P a t H a rrison,
ch airm an o f the senate finance
com m ittee, who has long favored
adjusting taxes in the hope of regaining
prosperity, and has detided
to risk a battle with the White House
if necessary.
The lines a re drawn. Th e P re sident
is still hoping to prevent action.
A hasty glan ce over recent re ferences
to taxation by “ D ear A lben”
B ark ley w ill show the real
view s o f the White House. B arkley
consults the White House before
salting his soup. No congressman
thinks B ark ley was talking out of
turn when he predicted m ere continuance
o f the nuisance taxes, plus
freezin g the social security taxes.
Th e clash betw een H arrison and
B ark ley excites the politically minded,
which m eans all o f congress,
because R oosevelt's strength thrown
to B ark ley m ade him D em ocratic
leader of the senate, by a m ajority
o f one, o v er Harrison.
John W. Hanes, undersecretary of
the treasury, is applauding H a rrison
w henever he thinks Corcoran
and Cohen a re looking the other
w ay. H enry Morgenthau approves
H arrison 's course also, but his deep
loya lty to R oosevelt prevents open
enthusiasm.
T h e big question m ark is whether
R oosevelt w ill risk vetoing a probusiness
tax bill which w ill scrap
som e o f his dearest brain children,
especially the remnant rem aining
of the tax on undistributed earnings.
Much is involved, including
the possibility o f a rift betw een the
Presiden t and H a rry Hopkins. Rum
ors are r ife that Hopkins expressed
considerable disappointm
ent o v er the e a rly dem ise o f the
appeasem ent program in his recent
talk with the President and Justice
W illia m O. Douglas.
Surprise That Harrison
Should Become So Militant
Hopkins is just as sore as the
P residen t over the defiant stand taken
by the United States Chamber
o f C om m erce, but he does not want
the President to kick all o f big business
in the face ju st because neither
likes the resolutions adopted by the
cham ber. The cham ber, Hopkins is
said to have urged on the P resident,
is not rea lly the vo ice o f all
business— not m ore than a m odicum
o f it, as a m atter o f fact. But Hopkins
faced an a ngered and muchgoaded
President. Th e left-w ingers
had been w orking up M r. Roosev
e lt's ire with considerable adroitness,
using the ch am ber's unfortunate
language as salt on his wounds,
and taking advantage o f the absence
of Dr. Hopkins' pa cifyin g linam
ent.
Developm ent o f the situation cam e
as a surprise to m ost o f Washington.
E veryon e knew that the P re sident
did not w ant any serious tax
revision, and knew w hy he did not
want it. The P residen t w as eager
to retain that penalty on undistributed
corporation earnings. H e had
been advised that there w as not a
chance of retain ing it if it ever
reached a vote.
Th e surprise w as that Senator
H arrison should becom e so militant.
N ot because his ideas about tax revision
to encourage business w ere
secret, but because it w as thought
he had little d esire to m ake a hopeless
fight against the President. Also
that he believed the President eventually
would be forced to yield in
order to produce sufficiently better
business conditions to m ake Dem ocra
tic success possible in 1940.
Sooner or Later Congress
If ill Take Profit Out of U ar
It is very difficult to run counter
to the contention that the profit
should be taken out o f w ar. For
that reason it is ve ry likely that,
i perhaps not at this session o f con-
; Kress, but sooner or later, congress
w ill pass som e such legislation as
that proposed by Sen. Josh L ee , or
by Sen. H om er T . Bone.
Th e country has been thoroughly
•old on the idea that a group of
w icked international munitions m akers
are alw ays stirrin g up trouble
and provoking w a r in order to make
profits. Th ere is just enough proof
o f the contention to m ake it politica
lly dangerous to go against it.
The difficulty, as p ra ctica l arm y
and navy m en see it, is that in
| order to prevent someone from m aking
a profit the country m ay, to
just that extent, cu rtail its own power
to m ake w ar. T o put it another
w ay, taking the profit out o f w ar
m ay succeed, but the effectiven ess
o f the country in w ar m ay be im paired
sufficiently by the restrictions
and taxation involved so that
the w a r m ay d ra g on fo r tw ice as
long as it otherw ise would.
Th is is on the old patriotic assumption,
o f course, that eventually
the United States would win any
w ar in which it was engaged. It
does not contem plate the other possib
ility— that the United States by
this im pairm ent o f its fighting effectiveness
m ight lose the w ar.
It f f ould Remove a Very
Potent Cause for War
A ctually, when w a r com es, no m atter
w hether it is brought about by
people anxious to m ake a profit or
by som e causes which even the munition
m akers could not control,
there w ill be an overw h elm in g desire
to take advantage o f e v ery
ounce o f effectiven ess possible. It
w ill be desired— and alm ost com pulsory—
that e v e ry man, wom an
and child shall do his or her utmost
to help win the w ar. Th ere would
be scant consideration given, for exam
p le, to any proposal to hold down
the number o f hours men or wom en
m igh t w ork in munition works, if
our arm y or navy w ere in a lifeand-
death struggle which m ight depend
on an adequate supply o f am munition.

Driving home through a torrential rain,
young, well-to-do Clint Jervlee picks up a
girl, scantily clad, running In terror-stricken
flight down the road, she rides a short
ways, leaves the car and runs Into the
woods. He decides to talk to his dear
friends. Inspector Tope and Miss Moss,
about his adventure. Clint still thinks of her
as Miss Moss, his former guardian, though
she and the Inspector are married. Clint,
having settled down, now manages the
Jervies estate himself. In three shuttered
houses, all gloomy and forbidding, on Kenesaw
Hill, near where Clint picked up
frightened girl, lived three families. In one
house lived old Denman Hurder, his wife, who
had been Ella Kenesaw, and his daughter.
Kitty Leaford, and her daughter June. Living
ln a second bouse was Aunt Evla Taine.
Uncle Justus and brothers Rab and Asa.
The third held old Matthew Bowdon and

R ab set the pan o f m ilk on the
bedside table. H e said: “ I 'v e been
tellin g June she ought to get out o f
thia mausoleum once in a while.
K itty , why don't you let m e show
her around? Why don’t w e three go
on a party some night? I 'l l get
theater-tickets, and w e’ll have dinner
in tow n ."
K itty aaid without turning her
head: “ Good night, R ab. I'm dead
tired. June’a a ll right. I 'l l take
ca re o f h e r."
. “ Think it o v e r,” Rab urged. “ E v eryone
here ia old, except June and
m e and you. And m aybe Asa. And
w e 'r e all old com pared with June.”
K itty swung around. "D o n 't w orry,
R a b ," she said, a slow passion
in her tones. “ I ’ m going to get
June out o f this. She sha’n 't live
as I ’ ve lived. Good night.”
R ab made an amused grim a ce at
June and went away.
June cam e behind her m other’ s
chair. " L e t m e brush it ," she o ffered
softly. " I s your head b a d ? "
“ I ’ve got to sleep tonight,” K itty
L ea fo rd whispered. “ Or go m ad!
Th is is one o f m y bad days. W arm
the m ilk fo r m e ."
June took the m ilk into the bathroom
, lighted the gas on the sm all
burner there and stirred the m ilk 10
that it should not burn. B y the time
it w as lukew arm , K itty L ea fo rd was
in bed. June poured the m ilk into a
glass, and brought it to her m other’ i
bedside. The glass was not quite
full.
“ I can fe e l thunder in the a ir,”
said K itty Leaford , and shuddered.
She had prepared for the night, as
she alw ays did, with an elaborate
care. June knew the ritu al: massage
— unguents — w avin g-iro n i in
her hair— gloves saturated with an
em ollient to keep soft her hands.
K itty L ea fo rd still served a beauty
that had vanished long ago.
“ I ’ ll com e in to you if it storm s,"
June promised.
"B r in g m e a tablet,” the older
w om an directed.
June hesitated. “ W on’t you be
able to sleep without. Mother? With
just the m ilk ?” she pleaded.
K itty said petulantly: "D o n 't argue
with m e tonight, June. I ’m not
fit to bear it. T h ey ’ re in the bathroom
ca b in et!”
June went back into the bathroom.
She rinsed the pan under
the faucet, delaying, trying to find
som e argument. She noticed that
the m ilky w ater was slow to drain
out o f the basin. The trap must
have becom e plugged.
H er mother called: “ Hurry,
J u n e!”
Th e g ir l opened the cabinet and
took out a fam iliar bottle. Th e bottle
had no label. She rem oved the
cork and let one tablet roll into her
palm. She set the bottle down a i
the edge o f the basin and w as about
to replace the cork when K itty L ea ford
called:
"June, I 'l l take two tonight. I
want to go to sleep quickly, sleep
sound.”
June m ade an unhappy gesture,
and her hand touched the uncorked
bottle. It fe ll into the basin, apilling
tablets. She rescued it hastily.
Th ere w as still a little w ater in the
Dasin, and the spilled tablets w ere
alread y half-dissolved. Th ere w ere
only three rem aining in the bottle.
June stood in some consternation,
and her mother called:
“ What w as that? June, did you
spill th em ?”
" I tipped o v er the bottle,” June
confessed. " I spilled one or tw o ."
“ F o r heaven's sake, be carefu l,”
K itty L ea fo rd cried fretfully. "D o c tor
C abler always cross-examines
m e when they go faster than he
thinks they should. Bring m e tw o ."
June took one m ore tablet out of
the bottle, so that she had two in
her hand, while two remained. She
put the bottle in its place and went
back into the other room. She sa id :
“ Mother, I wish you wouldn’ t take
them both. You rem em b er what
happened that other tim e? ”
" I took three that tim e,” her
m other retorted. “ Tw o w on’ t hurt
m e .”
“ You w ere aw fully s ic k !"
" I must get to sleep,” K itty Leaford
Insisted. She picked up the tablet*
from her daughter’* palm and
dropped them in the w arm milk.
S h * waited a moment to g iv e them
tim e to distolve. “ These are harm less,
June,” she urged. “ P ra c tic
a lly ! And they do m ake m e sleep.”
She laughed feverishly. “ T w ice
this many wouldn't really hurt me,
June.” H er eyes w ere haggard.
“ And I ca n 't help it. I f I don't
sleep, I go m ad.”
She drained the draft. “ That does
taste strong,” she said with a faint
grim ace. “ N ow run, baby. Kiss
m e, and go. I ’ll be asleep ln a
minute.”
June kissed her, m ade her lie
down, covered her over. She opened
one window a crack. K itty L ea ford
w a* not a fresh-air addict. June
looked at her and saw that she waa
alread y half asleep. T h e girl
turned oft th* light and slipped
aw ay.
A t the head o f the stairs she
paused long enough to be sure the
others w ere leaving. She heard
someone slide the bolt on the front
door, heard U ncle Justus say:
“ I'v e fastened it, Denman.”

m other’s room and her own w ere ia
the west w ing, over the big sittingroom.
A deep uneasiness possessed June.
When her own door was closed and
she was alone, she stood still, even
her eyes unmoving. It m ight be,
she thought, the sullen electric air
which m ade her thus restless and
fu ll o f a vague foreboding.
C H APTER IU
June undressed slowly, listlessly.
Th ere was nothing in life as she
knew it which could provoke her to
eagerness. H er m ovem ents w ere
automatic, her thoughts went round
and round a fa m ilia r circle.
This w as her world. These folk
who had been here tonight, and Uncle
Jim , who lived in the hut by the
pond. She thought o f him now with
a faint sm ile. Th ere was sound
m irth in him. H e used to laugh at
these people here; contrived nicknames
for them all to make June
sm ile. G randm a Bowdon was the
Iron Hand, Aunt E vie the V elvet
G love. G randm a and Grandpa Hurder
w ere the Conquered Provinces.
H e never sought to m ake June
laugh at her m othei, sne rem em bered
now. Once or tw ice she had
tried to persuade K itty Leaford to
go with her to m eet Uncle Jim.
“ You 'd like him. Mother,” she had
urged. “ I know you would.”
But her m other would never go.
The girl went m echanically about
the business o f preparing for the
night. H er eyes drifted half-resentfu
lly around the ugly room. She
loosed her hair and brushed it slowly
for a while, watching her reflection
in the m irro r above the m arble
slab. The house long since was still.
When at last she turned out her
own light and opened one o f the tall
windows, she saw Aunt E v ie ’ s house
next door w as dark and silent too.
Also she saw, fa r off, a flicker in
the sky; she even heard the rumble
of thunder. Y e t the storm might
not com e this w ay, or if it did, her
m other m ight not waken. She got
into the big bed and lay without
draw ing any coverin g over her, for
the night was hot, and the air was
lifeless and still. The old house
creaked all around h er; m ice scurried
in the walls.
She must have slept at last, and
fo r an indeterm inate time. It was
* gust of wind which woke her, a
sudden quickening in the tem po of
the night. Then lightning etched a
net o f flam e across the sky, and the
crashing thunderstroke burst in her
e a n .
June w as not afraid of thundershowers;
but her mother, despite
the drug she had taken, m ight have
w aked; June decided to go in and
se*. She knew the older woman
would b*. If th * w er* awake, cowar*
ing now, and cryin g out as though
from an actual physical pain. The
g irl got out o f bed and crossed the
hall to her m other’ s door.
Without opening the door, she listened,
but she heard no sound from
within. Y et still June hesitated, uncertain,
uneasy fo r no reason. In
the end she opened the door and
spoke softly into the darkness.
“ Mother, are you all righ t?”
But there was no reply, and June
w as reassured. She was about to
return to her own room, when lightning
flashed again, close by, and
the g la re o f it w as bright in the w indow
by K itty L ea fo rd '* bed. So
June saw her mother fo r this instant,
clearly.
And when the lightning passed,
the g irl stood still, her eyes dilated.
T h ere had been something alarm ing
in her m oth er'* posture, in the
w ay she lay along the bed.
With an abrupt m ovem ent June
turned on the light. An air-current
com ing from the open window in her
own room blew her door shut with
a reverberating crash; and she
leaped with dism ay at the sudden
sound. But her mother had not
roused— did not m ove as June bent
o v er the bed.
Mrs. Leafo rd la y on her side, her
head pillowed on her left a rm ; her
right arm lim p along the coverleta.
June had seen her in a drugged
sleep before, and there w as nothing
patently alarm ing in her appearance
now. But though her mother
la y on her side, hpr head w as turned
so that her fa ce w as upward. The
posture looked uncom fortable; and
June ve ry gently tried to m ove her
m other’ s head to the left so that it
m ight be at ease.
But when June touched K itty Leafo
rd ’s cheek sm eared with unguents,
her heart turned cold.
June caught her mother’s shoulders.
She shook them ; she cried :
"M o th er! M o th e r!"
But K itty L eafo rd m ade no response.
June m ight as w ell have
shaken a bolster loosely stuffed with
sand.
Th e girl backed aw ay from the
bed, her hands pressed to her lips.
She turned and ran down the stairs
to the telephone in the hall.
The instrument w as dead. She
snapped on the hall light— an electric
bulb hanging by one w ire in
the midst o f the gas chandelier—
and in that naked illumination she
tried the telephone again, without
response.
T e rro r was clam oring in h er; she
tried to fight it down, to think what
she should do.
Grandpa and Grandm a Hurder
w ere asleep at the end o f the hall,
but she knew there was no help in
them. Even if there w ere help anyw
here.
Then the electric light faded and
died, and June stood in the dark
hall like a tomb. She w as stifled
by the blackness; she gasped for
breath; and the front door blew
open, banging against the w all, and
the g irl choked back a scream .
She was swept by desperate and
nam eless terror; a gust o f rain
cam e sweeping in, and June ran
blindly to m eet it, out through the
door, into the full beat o f the rain.
Th e touch o f it was sw eet and cool.
Then she rem em bered that the
front door was always locked and
bolted. Uncle Justus had bolted it
tonight. Why had it opened o f itself?
Blind panic possessed her u tterly;
yet she clung to one thought: (h e
must fetch D octor Cabler.
She might have roused R ab or
Asa, asleep next door. Rab had even
a car. But she took no tim e to
think o f these things. She was already
racing across the lawn; she
found the gate in the hedge, and fe lt
the smooth hard m acadam under
her feet, and ran sw iftly. Occasionally
lightning flashes illumined
her w ay, kept her in the road.
She had gon* halfway to Doctor
C abler’ s house when a ca r cam e
down the hill behind her. She tried
to run faster, to escape this pursuer;
but thi* was vain, and she
turned off the road, and fell, and
scram bled to her feet and stood like
a w ild creature brought to bay.
The ca r stopped beside her, and
someone asked ■ question.
She stam m ered something, fo r
thi* w as a m an’* voice, and June
w as not habituated to encounter
strange men. But instantly, while
he used some persuasion, she found
h erself in the seat beside him.
H e offered her his coat, but (h e
refused it. Then this young man
beside her turned out the dash-light
so that darkneas drew a protective
garm en t o ver her, and she was
w arm with gratitude to him. She
said: “ Thank you—” She watched
him co vertly, controlling her breath.
H e asked som * question, suggesting
that she w as afraid, and she
told him that ahe was not afraid.
Y e t her knees w ere trem bling and
her fingers pressed her palms.
H e spoke again, but she did not
hear him. She watched the road,
and at the beginning of the path
through the wood to Doctor Cable
r ’s house, she bade this young
man stop the car. He did so. and
she alighted, and ran aw ay along
the path.
But hidden in the wood, she
stopped to look back; and she
stayed there till he drove on, watching
the headlights of his ca r till
their gleam w as lost behind a screen
o f trees.
When he was gone, she stood like
one bereft, as though with him a
part o f herself had departed too.
But then, in the darkness and the
rain, terror returned to spur her on.
She ran up the path and so cam e
pounding on the Doctor's door.
A t length a flashlight'* beam
cam e down the sta ir*; she could see
it through the panel o f the door. It
struck her in the eyes through the
glass; and at the sam e tim e the
door opened. The light was in her
eyes, and Doctor C abler exclaim ed:
“ June! God bless m e !”
She w hispered:
“ Come quick. Doctor C a b ler!”
"C o m e in, June,” he commanded,
and led her into the hall and shut
the door. "Y o u 're drenched. What
is it? ”
"O h, hurry, h u rry!” she cried.
“ I t ’s Mother. She's d ea d !”
The word on her own lips struck
her like a blow. She had not till
this m om ent shaped this word even
in her thoughts. "O h , hurry.” she
repeated; and thought in a dispassionate
apathy that the injunction
w as absurd. If her mother was
dead, there could be no reason for
haste. This had not occurred to her
before.
" E h ? ” the Doctor exclaim ed.
"D e a d ? ”
" Y e s ,” said June, in an em pty
tone. Even though the admission
convicted her of folly, convicted her
o f having lost her wits, of having
run without the slightest occasion
half a m ile through drenching rain,
y et she had no doubt that what she
said w as true.
K itty Leaford was dead. O f this,
now, June was sure.

[ [ T U R I N G the C ivil war David H.
| Ross, an 18-year-old cadet in
the G eorgia guards, was captured
and sent to a Union prison cam p on
L ake Erie. He escaped and made
his w ay to Canada, reporting to
Capt. John Y eates Beall, a Confederate
agent.
Ross joined Beall in a plan to
take possession of the Philo P a r sons,
a lake steam er, and with it
capture the Michigan, a Union w arship,
use that to attack Ft. Johnson
at Sandusky and release 1.000 Confederates
there.
On the morning o f September 19,
1864, the Philo Parsons stopped at
Sandwich, Ont., to take on a party
of 20 men. At Malden, a few m iles
farther, 20 m ore cam e aboard. A fter
several m ore stops, the crew and
the other passengers found themselves
looking into the muzzles of
pistols.
Th e captain relinquished com mand
and B eall took over with Ross
as first mate. And then the S. S.
I Island Queen with 170 Federal soldiers
aboard, pulled alongside. No
one knows why the soldiers perm itted
it, but after firing a few shots,
! B eall and Ross leaped aboard with
a handful of men and captured the
crew which w as too astonished to
| resist.
Th ey sailed on with their 170 Union
soldiers in tow, but the S. S.
Michigan com m ander was ready for

turned about and fled, docking in

Rebel Against Rebellion
A T T H E outbreak o f the C ivil war
* * a band of about 100 citizens of
Jones county, Mississippi, refused to
; identify them selves with the Confed-
I eracy. Under the leadership of one
N ew t Knight, they took refuge in
i L e a f R iv er sw am p where they defied
all efforts to make them fight
i under the Stars and Bars.
By 1864 they had complete control
o f the county and out of that
fact grew the story that this “ rebellion
within a rebellion” resulted in
form ing a “ Republic o f Jones” with
Knight as its head. Mississippians
declare, how ever, that there is no
official record o f any such “ repub-
| lie” e v e r having been launched and
they refer to these “ seceders from
secession” as the “ N ew t Knight
band of deserters.”
When the w ar w as over and Confederate
arm y veterans returned,
they induced the legislature to
' change the name o f the county from
“ Jones” to “ D avis,” because they
said the conduct o f Knight had
made its name “ a badge of ignominy
and a term of reproach.”
Knight alw ays denied that he was
a deserter but tried to get a pension
from the federal government. He
was unsuccessful because the records
at Washington failed to show
| his name enrolled in the (Jnion
arm y. H ow ever, there was some
compensation for him in the fact
that until his death in 1923, he was
w idely known as the “ founder of
j the Republic of Jones.”
H ut in W h ich Romulua an d Remus W e re
Suckled b y S h e -W o lf Still Standing
Th ere is one little spot in R om e
that is missed by the hundreds of
thousands o f visitors who go each
y ea r to the E ternal city. Usually
when a foreigner thinks o f R om e,
he thinks in term s o f the Colosseum,
the Forum or the Pantheon, w rites
Andre Simonpietri in “ Th e R ichmond
Tim es-D ispatch ."
I f he is an artist, his desire is to
see the Sistine Chapel and M ichael
A n gelo’* "L a s t Judgm ent,” or perhaps
Raphael's rooms. I f he is an
architect, he w ill want to visit St.
P e te r's Basilica and study Bernini's
colonnade, or muse o ver the im mense
and inexplicable arche* of
the Baths o f C aracalla. I f he 1* a
politician, he w ill try to pull enough
strings to arrange an in terview with
Mussolini. I f he is a Catholic, he
w ill want to see the Holy F ather and
receive his blessing.
So, perhaps that is the reason so
v e ry few ever locate this gem , the
"hou se” w here Romulus and R emus,
the founders o f R om e, pillowed
their baby heads in the fu rry tid e
o f the she-wolf.
Y ou ’ ll rem em ber the story o f how
the two little w aifs w ere found by
the w o lf on the banks o f the tawny
T ib er, and how the savage beast,
her m otherly instincts aroused, ca rried
the foundlings to her lair. T h *r *
sh* suckled them and nursed them
through the weakness of infancy •*
sturdy childhood. When the two
could feed for themselves, so the
legend has it, th* noble creature
took herself off to a secluded spot
and there let her anim al soul speed
on its w a y in peace.
Then the two youths went forth
into the tribes that inhabited the
Sabine hills, and there they bartered
for w ives Upon their return
they set about the business o f founding
a new race and a new city, after
having divided their tiny domain.

' ' Fredericksburg, Va., went to
Spain as an attache to the American
embassy, he was only 18 but already
famous as a poet. N ext he served
in the Spanish and French arm ies
and becam e a friend o f Lafayette.
M ade a ch evalier o f France, he
returned to A m erica to flght in the
Revolution but w as thwarted ln that
ambition. In 1786 he accompanied
the young Polish patriot, Kosciusko,
to W arsaw w here K in g Stanislaus
m ade him a baron at the age of 24!
H e was sent to make a treaty with
Em press Catherine o f Russia, who
becam e ve ry fond o f him.
When the w ar between Russia and
Turkey started, she commissioned
him a m ajor-general in her arm y
and he later served under the adm
iral of her fleet, John Paul Jones.
H e remained at the Russian court
until 1791, then returned to Warsaw
where he was m ade a m ajor-general
in the Polish arm y.
When the Polish rebellion against
Russia failed, Kosciusko and L ittlepage
went to P a ris to try to rescue
their frfend, La fa yette, imprisoned
during the Reign o f Terro r. They
failed and Kosciusko returned to
Warsaw to try again to win freedom
for Poland. L ittlepage Joined him
and was wounded in the battle in
which Kosciusko fell.

and retired to his home in F redericksburg

EW Y O R K .—In 1914, S. S. McClure
published his autobiography.
As he was only 57 at the
time, tt was a *ort o f ju ven ile prank
McClure’, Early “o f seriously ^
Autobiography tended. Now, at
Bui a Prologue 82> he i# busier
than ever, w riting
books and digging into social
problems, and the word is that
next Septem ber he w ill revive his
M cC lure's Magazine.
Lincoln Steffens, and others o f his
shining legions o f dragon-slayers
have passed, or else taken second
thought, like Ida Tarbell, and, unless
things change a lot between
now and next fall, he w ill find the
sam e old dragons still around, and
possibly quite a few litters of new
ones, some o f them strange breeds,
and perhaps * bit scalier than any
h* ev er knew.
Two years ago, the whippy little
Irishman, with the rumpled
hair and the rumpled suit, wrote
a piece in which he Indicated
that the disquieting noises of the
capitalist system were just body
■qneaks and that the engine was
still all right. His idea is to go
on from here, instead o t backing
np, and it Is to be assumed that
will be his take-off for the rer
iv e d magazine. After 60 years
of battling for elvie righteousness
he concludes that the
I ’nited States Constitution is a
changeless and unchangeable
document, which will in time set
everything right if we just stay
within Its ground rules.
Still crackling with aphorisms and
Greek quotations in his ninth decade,
he might be reminiscent—talking
about O liver Wendell Holmes,
Theodore Roosevelt, W illiam Dean
Howells, G ilbert Parker, Robert
Loui* Stevenson, Rudyard Kipling,
Arthur Conan Doyle, Jam es M. B arrie,
et al. But he is chock-fuU of
today, and yesterday ia just so much
ink through the printing press. A ll
the above and many others like
them w ere his business and social
Intimates. H e has probably led
m ore famous w riters in leash than
•n y other man.
In IKS, when he was nin*
years old, his parents, of a family
of farmers and carpenters,
brought him to a prairie farm
in Indiana. He sold $1 microscopes
on the street corners of
Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth,
and Chicago; worked his way
through Knox college; got a $7-
a-week Job editing The Wheelman
for the Pope Manufacturing
company, started his syndicate,
and, in 1893, McClure's
Magasine, in that other doleful
day when his friends all said;
"T h * funeral's tomorrow." He
says he is Just getting wound up.
p A R L V A N D O R E N denies there
is any "n ew barbarism " in the
world and says that what ailed us
ia the sam e old barbarism. There
O l d B a r d i n , “
H o l d * a S p e l l continuity in
O v e r V a n D y k e choice of
W. S. Van Dyke
to direct the filming o f Sinclair
L ew is’ " I t Can’t Happen H ere ."
Not that there is anything barbarous
about Mr. Van Dyke, but,
as w e recall it, he got his start helping
direct D. W. G riffith's film, " In toleran
ce," which was a tolerably
complete round-up o f the old barbarism.
That was 24 years ago, and
the Sinclair Lew is opus picks up
right where Messrs. Griffith and
Van Dyke left off, without missing
■ flicker.
In the world's fair time cap-
*ulc, Mr. Van Dyke might b*
memorialised as the man who
call* Greta Garbo “ K id" and
gets away with It—or as th*
man who once spanked I.up*
Veles when she went temperamental
on the lot. They call
him th* hard-boiled director
with the velvet touch. He Is a
ragged, weather-beaten slx-foot-
*r, a newsboy, miner, logger,
stage-drlver, expressman, grocery
elerk and laborer before h*
went to Hollywood.
H e got a toe-hold in Hollywood by
selling * few scripts. At first he
was one o f many o f G riffith’s a v
sistants, later one of his aces. P ro ducers
like him because he goes
straight through without w ater or
feed. He used to m ake a full-length
serial in nine days and a Western
in three, w riting his *cript aa hc
] worked. He did many jungle and
South Sea films, such as "T ra d er
Horn” and "W h ite Shadows."
His father, a San Diego Judge
and a cousin of the late Henry
Van Dyke, died when the boy
was eight year* old. Rnstling
hard to help his mother support
the family accounts for his versatility
and his skill la typ*

Capitol Notes
Governor Heil is reported to favor
a bill which would appropriate $25,000
to send the University o f Wisconsin
concert band on tours to the W orld’s
Fairs at New Y ork and San Francisco
to advertise Wisconsin.
The assembly ha* engrossed a bill
which requires all male fishermen over
18 years o f age to have a $1 fishing
license, whether they use rod and reel,
cane pole, or just hook and line.
Women are exempt fn>m the requirements
o f the bill.
A resolution which would have suggested
to the University Board of
Regents that they boost resident
student fees $15 or more a year has
been refused by the assemby.
THE WITTENBERG ENTERPRISE, WITTENBERG, WIS.
exactly what the “ Octopus” did under
the caption: POOR J U L IU S ’ A L M
A N A C K fo r 1939— “ Being Proverbs
and Preachments Suitable for Commit
ting to Mem ory— These Most Faithfu
lly Set Down from the Publick
Utterances o f Your Friend and Ours
the Reticent Mr. Heil.** Excerpts:
1. “ And if you want to be courteouy
to me, won’t you, when you go to bed
at night, just say a prayer fo r me, as
I go forth as a good Christian soldier
to heal our wounds?”
2. “ I think our W hite father in
Washington needs divine guidance
W on’t you pray that our father in
Washington w ill have his mind chang
ed ?”
Who, if not the Governor, needs our
prayers ? Who is more in need of
“ divine guidance” than our president?
Then are these statements o f Mr
H eil’s so humorous? Personally, we
fail to see the humor— yet we read
“ A ll Wisconsin chuckled last week as
U niversity students retaliated in their
fashion. “ A ll our lives we have heard
our pastors pray in the General
Prayer at services each Sunday that
God would bless “ the President of
these United States and the Governor
o f this Commonwealth.” And that
prayer has never struck us as funny
In fact more prayers on the part of
our rulers and people are what we
need for, as Tennyson said, “ More
things are wrought by Prayer than
this world dreams of.” Certainly
prayer is no subject fo r disparaging
remarks and no one ought to be
“ razzed” because he prays.
And while we are on this subject of
“ not so funny jokes” we shall mention
our regret over an incident o f a few
weeks ago. A t the end o f a very interesting
play, the combination living
and dining room was transformed into
a plain, old-fashioned room with a
cuspidor and a homely portrait very
much in evidence. Then to date the
room unmistakably as old-fashioned
and plain, a motto: “ Christ Is the
Head o f This House” was hung awry
on one o f the walls. W ater colors,
samplers, and wall shelves literally
running over with every manner of
silly gew gaw — families o f cats, Mickey
Mouse bands and what-have-you—
may be the fad o f today, but many of
us still cling to our faith that “ Christ
IS the head o f our home ami we are
proud to hang a motto stating so on
our wails. T o us, holding up that
statement to ridicule was not funny.
I t was offensive, and in extremely
poor taste besides being quite unnecessary.

Y OU have had the experience,
haven’t you, o f going into tom e
stores and asking for an a dvertised
brand o f goods, only to have the
clerk hand you another brand and
inform you, “ But it’s just as go o d ."
Som etim es, to your reg ret, you
bought the "ju s t as g o o d " item but
som etim es you w alked out o f the
store and searched until you found
the m erchandise you
had asked fo r in the
first place. When
you got it you w ere
satisfied.
You had confidence
in the a dvertised
goods, because
you read in the honest
pronouncements
o f the a d vertiser
w hat you m igh t expect
his preduct to
do for you. This Charles Roth
g a v e you assurance.
Y ou bought because you had confidence.
But when that cle rk palm ed o ff
som ething different on you, you had
m isgivin gs, you had doubts, you had
fears, you had lack o f confidence.
M aybe they w ere justified. M a y be
they w ere not. It doesn’ t m atter.
T h e fa c t rem ains that a d vertising
had invested the ad vertiser's
goods with a confidence which m ade
your buying a pleasant in p la ce of
a fearfu l duty.
Usually, but not always, these
.“ Just as good” goods are not as
food—they are Inferior and the merchant
sells them because they carry
more profit for him. He does his
level best to get rid of them, because
It is more to his advantage
to do so than it is to yours.
M any stores pay their salesman
a com m ission fo r selling unknown
and unadvertised goods, because the
salesm an would not sell them without
som e special inducement.
It is much better fo r you as a
consum er to put your reliance absolutely
in advertised goods and in
stores which advertise, and to patronize
both exclu sively.
When a man advertises his goods
and tells frankly and publicly what
they w ill do fo r you, he seeks your
patronage on the basis o f actual
value.
It m ay be that som e m anufacturers
or m erchants can offer just
as good valu e in unknown or unadvertised
goods. But the chances
a re ten to one that they can’t— because
advertisin g not only increases
the distribution o f goods, but at the
sam e tim e increases the production,
so that a dvertised goods cost less
to m a k e; hence, g ive s m ore to th e'
buyer.
In the long ran yon get more for
your money when you buy advertised
goods. You get more in actual
value. And also get more In
that intangible value, known as confidence.
And confidence is one o f the ch ief
satisfactions o f life.

There are jokes— good jokes, and no
one enjoys them more than we do.
But there are smart cracks which are
not jokes; and the University o f W isconsin
publication "Octopus” , campus
funny paper, made a few o f those “ not
so funny cracks” recently. N o one enjoys
them lees than we!
Wisconsin is justly proud o f her
U niversity; and certainly it was a
bitter pill when Governor Heil slashed
$1,000,000 from the U niversity’s budget.
But why, if the students at the
U niversity must denounce and ridicule
the man who is Governor o f this state
(a disrespectful and unsportsmanly
thing to do), must he be ridiculed because
he is a Christian? Y et that is

W ittenberg 6, Elderon 2
The highly touted Elderon team
came to W ittenberg Sunday to play
the Pilots. A fte r the last man was out
in the 9th the Pilots were ahead 6 to
2. The game was marked with many
errors and extra base hits. Krull was
quite wild in the first couple innings
but steadied to pitch a very good
game.
With the addition o f Derrow, Vance,
Schoepke and Coyle on the team, the
Pilots have a very strong lineup and
should go fa r this season.
Quite a large crowd attended Sunday’s
game but more fans should turn
out and support the team. It also

“Assassin o f the N ile”
He l l o , e v e r y b o d y :
Y ou know, boys and girls, I have often said that you’ ll
find adventure close to home a darned sight easier than you w ill
roam ing the world. One who goes travelin g in search of thrills
usually doesn’ t find any until he gets back into his own bailiw ick
again. But there a re exceptions to e v ery rule— and h ere's one of
them. G eorge C. D orste o f Bardonia, Rockland county, N. Y .,
m et his biggest th rill when he was thousands o f m iles aw ay
from hom e and in a strange exotic country.
The country was E gypt, and G eorge landed there in the
course o f his travels as a firem an on a tram p steam er. The steam er
was carryin g scrap iron, unloading it in consignments of v a rious
sizes at ports along the N ile rive r and its m any branches.
The y ea r was 1912, and the ship had tra veled part w a y up the
N ile and was anchored in the riv e r just south o f the town of
M edinet E l Faiyum .
The ship was anchored not fa r from a pier. The w eath er
is p retty hot in E gypt. In the afternoon, particu larly, the
sun beats down with such intensity that it is next to im possible
for anybody but a native to do any work. It was
at the height o f the hot season, and the cre w o f the steam er, dripping
sw eat from e v e ry pore o f their bodies, w ere just about all in. Along in
the afternoon the skipper gave orders fo r all hands to knock o il work for
the rest o f the day.
T h e men didn't argue about that. M ost o f them just w alked to
the shadiest spot they could find on that hot ship, flopped on the
deck and rested. But there w ere a h a lf doxen young fellow s—
G eo rg e among them— who had a better idea. Th ey stripped off
their clothes and d ived o v er the side into the w ater.
The Hot Sun Beat Down on the Hull of the Vessel.
T h e w ater was cool and refreshing. Those lads w ere in it,
off and on, for the better part o f tbe afternoon. Th ey cam e out,
now and then, fo r a breathing spell on the ship’s deck, but the
CHOCOLATE SILV E R CAKE

A g rea t rep tile w as betw een him and the ship— and not m ore than
M fe e t from him.
son beating down on the iron hull o f the vessel m ade it so hot that
they w ere glad to get back in the w ater again.
Th e afternoon w ore on and the sun began sinking toward the horizon.
As its scorching ra y s w ithdrew little by little, the day becam e cooler.
One by one the sw im m ers clim bed back aboard the steam er and
stayed there. F in a lly all of them w ere out o f the w ater excep t one.
And that one man was G eorge Dorste.
G eo rge loved the w ater and he hated to lea ve it. H e w as sw im m ing
som e distance aw ay from the ship's side, and about half-w ay between it
and the pier As he splashed about in the rive r he heard a vo ice calling
on shore and, looking up, saw a native standing on the pier.
The native w as shouting to G eorge, but in a language he didn't
understand. Then suddenly he began to point toward the ship.
G eorge could figure out only one reason for that pointing. He im m
ediately jum ped to the conclusion that someone aboard had
dropped something o v er the side and wanted him to retrieve it.
H e turned and sw am slow ly toward the ship. T h e n ative on the pier
kept right on yelling, but G eorge paid no attention. And then, suddenly,
he saw it— a thing that looked like a log floating in the w ater, but a log
that had a rough w rinkled snout and a pair of glassy eyes just showing
above the surface!
The P ier Was a Great Distance Away.
A crocodile!
The great rep tile was between him and the ship— and not m ore
than 20 feet a w a y from him. A shudder went through G eo rg e's
body when he saw it. He turned and began sw im m ing tow ard
the pier. But the pier was a grea t distance aw ay—or at least, so
it seem ed to G eorge. H e knew that beast could catch up to him
in less tim e than it takes to tell the story.
H e was sw im m ing as fast as he could—exhausting h im self in a spurt
for the pier. And the crocodile w as follow ing along behind. It seem ed
to G eorge that the g rea t rep tile never approached any closer than that
original 20 feet—the distance that had separated them when he turned
toward the pier. W as the beast playing with him, as a cat would with a
mouse? O r was it w aitin g until G eorge had exhausted h im self in his
sw im toward shore b efore those cru el ja w s opened and closed o ver him?
Still sw im m ing fra n tica lly, he reached the pier. And then
another terrify in g discovery greeted him. As he m ade frenzied
efforts to clim b up the poles that supported the pier, he found that
he couldn't. Those polls w ere covered with a slippery moss. He
could make no headw ay up them. And all the tim e, now, the
crocodile was com ing closer, sw im m ing slow ly tow ard w hat it
knew must Inevitably furnish It its evening m eal.
He Scraped and Clawed at the Moss-Covered Piles.
B y now, G eorge w as m ad with terror. He w as still claw in g and
scraping frantically at those smooth, m oss-covered piles when the native
on the dock cam e to his rescue. Suddenly, the n ative picked up a
huge piece of scrap iron from a pile on the dock, and hurled it at the
sw im m ing crocodile. Th e piece missed. The native threw another— and
that one found its m ark . It hit the beast on the snout, and it dived
beneath the surface.
By that tim e a boat had been launched from the ship. It
cam e tearing across the w ater as G eo rge’ s shipm ates pulled
hard on the oars. It reached G eo rge a fe w seconds a fter the
crocodile had gone down.
" A s they pulled m e out o f the w a te r," G eo rge says, “ I lost consciousness
for a m inute or two. But I cam e back to life before the boat
had reached the ship—in tim e to see the steely eyes of the crocodile
which had reappeared once m ore. It was follow ing along, not m ore than
10 feet behind the boat.”
And Georgo says that if he'd had a gun then, it would have given
him the greatest pleasure to aim it right between those two glassy eyes
and pull the trigger.

Wildlife Federation ^ orks
Th e National W ild life federation
reports a steady increase in laws
protecting A m e rica 's m ost popular
gam e fish, the black bass. In all
but five states, there is a closed
season on the sm all-m outh and
large-mouth bas3. Th irty-eight
states prohibit the sale o f black
bass. In 1937 a fed era l la w was
enacted prohibiting the interstate
shipment of black bass illega lly
caught. A vote in all o f the states
gave the bass first place as the
sportsm an’s choice am ong 1839
to Protect the Blark Bass
WildlTfe W eek stamps. It is pointed
out that black bass do not spawn
until w ater conditions are suitable,
and that the m ale bass guards the
nest until the spawn hatch. While
the nest is guarded, the m ale flsh is
in poor condition, is ea sily caught,
and his capture m eans the destruction
o f the eggs. F u ll protection
until the spawn is hutched is highly
necessary to the w elfa re o f the v a rious
m em bers o f the bass fa m ily ,
which includes biuegills, crappy,
sunflsh and rockbass.
Of Course You Can Bake
" I didn't have good luck with m y
cake baking today.” Y ou and I have
both heard hom em akers say just
that— reason enough perhaps for our
getting right down to cases today
and flnding out just w hat it is that
m akes for good luck— or bad luck—
as the case m ay be in this cake
baking business.
O f course it rea lly isn't a case of
luck at all, fo r the right proportions
o f the right ingredients combined in
the right w ay and baked at the right
oven tem perature elim inate luck entire
ly and assure baking success not
som etim es but always.
Inform ation Please.
O f course you own a m easuring
cup but have you looked at it critica
lly to see
whether or not it
has a rim which
extends above
the accurate cup
m easure? I f it
has a rim , do you
m easu re the ingredients
just to
—. this point accu-
- ~jl rately, or clear to
x S f c - p U the top inaccurately?
Do you alw ays sift the flour once
just before m easuring?
Do you use a fine granulated sugar
when m aking cakes? Th ere is a d ifference,
you know.
Do you cream the shortening and
m ix the cake with a beating motion,
not a stirring motion?
Do you lev el off the teaspoon
m easures o f baking powder, salt or
soda with a knife so as to be sure
they, too, are accurate?
Do you start the oven 10 to 15
minutes in advance so it w ill be unifo
rm ly hot before the cake is placed
in it?
Do you use a sm all, inexpensive
oven therm om eter for securing accurate
oven tem peratures if your
range has no oven heat-control?
These are some o f the ch ief fa ctors,
careful attention to which helps
to spell success in cake baking. T iy
them out in the group o f fa vo rite
cake recipes given below. I think
you w ill like them and the recipes

RE C E N T L Y returned from
Sweden, a man who has
been connected with the m otion
picture business for some
twenty-five years made a firsthand
report to this column on
the subject o f G reta Garbo in
her homeland.
^Her countrymen, he said,
a 'r e n ’ t tr e m e n d o u s ly im pressed
by her success. They
like her pictures, go in droves
to see them, but they feel that ol
course she ought to be a success—
just a case of home-town g ir l m aking
good.
Th ey are inclined to resent her
aloofness— they feel that she ought
to rea lize that they wouldn’ t dream
o f intruding on her privacy, and that
she doesn’t have to treat them as
she does the m ovie fans o f other
countries.
H e had several photographs of
her, taken in the days when she was
a hat model. They w ere sweet,
rather sim pery, givin g no hint of
what she was to become.

Apparently the best w ay to m ake

“ Y e s s ir,” beamed the m anager.
“ I t ’ s on its way back now .”
