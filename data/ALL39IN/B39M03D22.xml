D ED ICATE D
One o f the biggest days in Pleasant
View for a long time was held
last Friday when the new school addition
and remodeled old building was
duly dedicated The building was
open all afternoon for inspection and
the dedication program was put on
at 4 o clock 
State Superintendent John Callahan 
o f Madison was the guest speaker
o f the day He stated that had he
been invited to a like service in Milwaukee
that day he would have accepted
the Pleasant View invitation 
He gave a fine talk stressing the
values o f education and its many
phases 
The two old rooms o f the school
house have been entirely refinished
and the new addition which may be
seen on the right o f the picture accompanying
this article are large 
light and most attractive The addition
extends the full width o f the
building and there is a full basement
under it which is equally light as
four sets o f full length double windows
are set in along the east side
and more on the south side The
basement has not been finished inside
but it was used for the assembly program
for dedication Friday and was
attractively decorated in green and
white in honor o f the occasion and
St Patricks day A fine automatic
control heating and ventilating plant
are a part o f the equipment 
A stage was built on the south end
o f the building and on it were seated
Mr Callahan speaker o f the day;
Miss Grace Webb county superintendent;
Harold Turner general chairman
o f the arrangement committee;
Bert F Johnson superintendent of
schools here and Attorney E S Jedney 
A beautiful basket o f spring
flowers was on the stage 
The program consisted o f music
from a brass quartet from the Black
River Falls high school directed by
Jay Jorgensen 
Mr Johnson was called on by Mr 
Turner and gave an impromptu talk
and congratulated the district on
their fine new building 
Miss Webb also made a few brief
remarks and extended her congratulations 
A string ensemble from the high
school under the direction o f Miss
Verna Keefe gave a very fine selection 
Mr Jedney a member o f the city
school board and a popular speaker 
gave a very good talk on education 
The afternoon program closed with
Mr Callahans address and as one o f
his listeners said the only trouble was
he didnt talk long enough 
There was another program in the
evening at which Mr Hughes of
Sparta engineer on the project gave
a very fine talk The people o f the
district are appreciative o f what he
has done on the job There was a
large attendance at night and dancing
to music by Alvin Lees orchestra
furnished entertainment 
No small part in the afternoon and
evening was contributed by the members
o f the Pleasant View Parent 
Teachers Association They served a
wonderful lunch which took fhe place
o f a supper at the close o f the afternoon
program and served again in
the evening The members worked
under difficulties in serving even now
but nothing to what they did when
they first sttarted Their first serv i Lutheran church
ing was done on a broken down oil
stove by the light o f a lantern Friday
they served in one o f the class
rooms from a new oil stove and under
a fine lighting system It will be
fine when they can have a well equipped
kitchen installed in the basement
and we hope it wont be long Hot
meals are served to the school children
now 
The district is to be wrarmly congratulated
on the fine new building
which will be useful to them in so
many ways besides housing the school
under one roof again

AN NOU NCIN G SECOND
A N N U AL H OBBY SHOW
The second annual Hobby Show is
scheduled for the third week in April 
It will be held as last year in the
high school auditorium but will be
continued for a longer time to accommodate
more out of town people In
addition to Friday evening and Saturday
afternoon this years exhibit
will be open to the public Saturday
evening and Sunday afternoon April
21st and 23rd 
Although there were a few entries
made by people outside o f Black
River Falls last year most o f the exhibitors
were from the city In this 
our second show we hope for many
more county hobbyists to join ill the
exhibits 
The same general procedure inaugurated
last year will be followed
again so watch the Banner Journal
for classification lists entry days entry
blanks etc In the meantime
polish your hobby work out a new
method o f display and write explanatory
notes to accompany items in
your display wherever such would be
interesting and instructive to visitors 
This year we hope to avoid the disjplay
o f mere curios as hobbies (howi
ever we may have a certain portion
: devoted entirely to curios) Each
hobby exhibit should consist o f a
handwork or collection constantly followed
by the exhibitor Most usually
any collection will o f necessity contain
those things displayed last year
but if it a real hobby new items
should have been added during the
intervening year There may be
those whose collections are so large
and varied that entirely different
items may be displayed this year
if so lets have them Whatever the
case lets get our hobbies in shape
for display and lets cooperate to
make the 1939 Hobby Show bigger
and better than our first attempt in
1938

RA ZIN G OF TOM AH INDIAN
SCHOOL BUILDINGS H ALTED
The following story regarding the
Tomah Indian school buildings was in
a recent issue o f the La Crosse Trib 
INFORM ATION W AN TED
Peter E Mickleby o f Noti Oregon 
is trying to get some trace o f his sisters 
He last saw them in Black
River Falls in 1901 One o f them at
that time was married to William
Torrison who worked in a grist mill 
Mrs Torrison would be 71 years of
age and her younger sister would be
6 8 She was unmarried when last
he saw her Their names were Lena
and Adie There is a possibility that
Wm Torrison might be in Spokane 
Washington Any information as to
their whereabouts will be appreciated
by J F Wigle o f Noti Oregon who
whote to the sheriff in the matter 
Mr Waldum turned the letter over
to us 
Tomah Wis (Special) Although
the federal governments move to
raze some o f the Indian boarding
school buildings has been halted temporarily 
at least by house action
citizens o f this community will not
cease their campaign to have the idle
buildings comprising a virtual community
in itself repaired and put to
some use Mayor E C Otto who
with other members o f the Tomah
Advancement association is opposing
the government proposal said this
week 
Rep Harry Griswold telegraphed
the association from Washington this
week that an amendment to a bill
before the house has been tentatively
accepted which would prohibit the
Indian bureau from tearing down the
buildings with funds at its disposal
Local citizens generally feel that
means in effect that the government
has been thwarted in its efforts to destroy
what has in the past been
definite asset to this community 
 That does not mean however 
said Mayor Otto  that we will stop
working We are putting pressure on
the department o f interior to either
make use o f the buildings or turn
them over to some department who
could use them At the same time we
are circulating literature throughout
the country pointing out the waste
o f this government property which
was paid for with the peoples money 
T
he mayor said local citizens are
not attempting to tell the government
what it should do with the property 
although they are suggesting that the
buildings could possibly be turned
over to some other department re
paired and used for other purposes
a CCC camp resettlement project or
to house state or federal offices which
lack adequate facilities at the present
time In connection with that 
Otto pointed out that about 1935 the
department o f interior indicated that
it would be willing to turn the buildings
over to another department
which could utilize them 
The buildings were abandoned in
1937 when the Indian bureau decided
that Indian boarding schools were not
the most efficient method o f educating
the race For the most part 
the some 15 or 20 buildings have
stood idle since then

necessary

We have no white collar ideas when
we deal with our farmer friends Our
service is practical and down to earth 
We know that our growth and local
prosperity in general depend upon how 
well the farmer gets along financially 
Our job as we see it is to help the farmer
in money matters in every way we can
and we re trying to do a good job in this
respect 
At this season of the year farmers can
use banking service to good advantage

HOME M AKERS
The third series o f Home Makers
leaders meetings was held at the
court house Black River Falls Friday 
March 17 under the able leadership
o f Margaret McCordic Home
Management Specialist on  Storage
Spaces 
Our county president Mrs Chatt 
was absent so Mrs W B Potter of
Disco opened the meeting by roll
call VVe had something which was
quite different and enjoyed by all in
the form o f moving pictures for our
singing The words for a couple lines
o f song and a pretty scene relating to
song came on followed by another
two lines and picture while we sang 
The songs sung were  America the
Beautiful  Dreaming and  Home 
Sweet Home The pictures were very
pretty 
W e studied storage spaces from all
angles and had some very fine pictures
for suggestions also picture of
Mrs Mortensons lovely home to go
by In the importance and necessity
o f good storage spaces we know conditions
go verning these things depend
largely upon the size age and number
in family We may have either built
in or movable furniture for storage 
O f course if you are a renter you
may choose movable storage furniture
as best so you can take it with
you when you move 
* We also studied the requirements
o f successful storage o f vegetables 
storage temperatures sufficient mois 
* ture good ventilations etc 
The bulletins handed out to us
are full of good suggestions for home
improvements at little cost Always
look around home first to see if you
have material which you can use to
remodel with You would be surprised
o f some o f the nice things you can
make from old furniture In one of
these bulletins 1 see an old sewing
machine taken apart top used as a
desk with telephone above Another
picture shows the top of an old kitchen
cabinet makes a handy desk for
business and planning center Lowering
the wail telephone makes it;
possible to use it while sitting at the
desk 
Mrs McCordic left several large
pictures to be passed around to each
club They will be used by a club at
club meeting day and returned as
soon as possible to Mr Beans office 
The person having club next call for
them etc This way we hope each
club sees them 
There were several jlubs absent 
When your nearest neighbor club has
their next meeting try and send some
one from your club there (if your
club missed this meeting) to take
this lesson back into your club 
Our meeting closed with a summary
by moving pictures o f all we
had studied during the day This was
a very instructive meeting and we do
hope we can take at least a part of
it back into our home club 
The next meeting will be around
the middle o f April All try and attend
as it will be an important
meeting for all o f us Following are
a few clubs who meet next Looking
at their dates will give you an idea
where and how to plan your club
meeting days so to get the pictures

MRS J J BRINKM AN
DIES IN G EO RG IA
Friends will regret to learn o f the
death o f Mrs J J Brinkman a former
resident o f this city and for
more than a quarter century a resident
o f Waycross Georgia She will
be remembered here as Florence
Head a daughter of the late Mr and
Mrs J C Head The sympathy o f all
is extended to Mr Brinkman and his
son who mourn her loss 
The following account is from the
Waycross Journal:
Mrs Florence Brinkman 1208 Albany
avenue for more than 25 years
a resident of Waycross died last
night at her home after an extended
illness She had suffered for some
months with heart trouble and dropsy 
Born in Quesqueton Iowa Dec 31 
1861 she was the last o f six children 
two o f whom died in infancy Her
elder sister died in December 1888 
in Black River Falls Wis and her
younger sister Mrs Mary Hostrawser
died in Waycross Jan 2 l J23 Her
only brother H D Head passed
away April 30 1936 at Neillsville 
Wis Mrs Brinkman is survived by her
husband J J Brinkman of this city
and one son Hugh J Brinkman of
Appleton Wis who deeply mourn
her passing 
Mrs Brinkmans parents Mr and
Mrs J C Head moved from Iowa
to Black River Falls Wis in 1868 
where their children gained their education 
Mrs Brinkman entering the
teaching profession which she followed
and loved as a part o f her life for
more than 25 years without neglecting
her home which she considered
the dearest place on earth 
Mr and Mrs Brinkman were married
July 16 1885 Mr Brinkman
was telegraph operator bookkeeper 
and general station agent for 35
years when they decided to seek a
warmer climate A fter considerable
traveling and investigating they
chose Waycross as the best place to
spend their declining years 
Mrs Brinkman often said  I love
my friends be they in the south 
north east or west She never
shirked a duty and bravely made sacrifices
to ease the burdens o f others
less fortunate and though most of
those o f her age have gone on be
fore her she will be mourned and
missed by those who knew her 
Her good bye was  Meet me in

H OT LUNCHES A T SCHOOL
We visited the hot lunch project at
the junior high school building for
the first time yesterday and found it
a fascinating affair It was not only
so much larger than we had thought 
but so well organized and so apparently
beneficial that it was a considerable
surprise 
From 100 to 150 lunches are served
daily The kitchen is fitted into
the southeast corner o f the middle
upstairs class room in the junior high
and the tables and benches have all
been painted a uniform light green 
There were seven tables seating eight
or nine to a table Bright rectangles
o f gaily colored oilcloth were at each
place a glass o f water and silver 
The menu yesterday consisted of a
big serving o f excellent spaghetti 
hamburger and tomatoes and a good
serving o f prune sauce The adjoining
classroom and the sewing room
across the hall accommodated the
rest o f the diners who carry with
them anything additional that they
may wish Small children from the
grades come in first and higher
classes later All were served quickly
and quietly Mrs Julia Thompson is
in charge o f the serving and is assisted
by Mrs Nichols Miss Hazel
Finn has been substituting for Miss
Virginia Leffingwell who is recovering
from an operation for appendicitis 
Sometimes some o f the girls
lend a hand This hot meal costs 3
cents per person and the wonderful
part o f it is that last year there was
only a little over a dollar shortage on
this amount in our school according
to Mrs Thompson 
The hot dish is furnished by the
school and paid for by the 3 cent
charge Prunes peaches butter occasionally
fresh friut and other articles
are furnished by the WPA 
The menu for the week was written
on the board Listen to how
good it sounds:
Monday vegetable soup
Tuesday Spaghetti hamburger
and tomatoes prune sauce
Wednesday Creamed peas and
carrots peach sauce
Thursday Mashed potatoes meat
balls and gravy
Friday Macaroni and tomatoes
From the dining room we went to
the high school gym to look in on the
supervised play that is going on every
noon Miss Reuter has charge o f two
days a week Mr Edelbeck of three 
There were 75 or 100 students engaged
in various activities Little
folks playing jacks a group playing
volley ball some playing cards about
a dozen boys engaged in a dart game
at the top o f the stairs leading to
the balcony Checkers bridge cribbage
and 500 tournaments are arranged 
shuffle board played Students
who have studying to do were
in the study hall which was in charge
o f Mrs Sadie Madsen Mr Edelbeck
was on duty in the gym It was a
busy place and a vast improvement
on the old days when the school buildings
were locked during the noon
hour We liked it 
Hot lunches have been served here
for the past four years the first two
from the home economics department
and the last two under the present
arrangement It is a W PA project
and it is rumored that if the WPA
continues that is one project that will
continue It is in effect in this school 
Melrose Hixton Pleasant View A lma
Center and Merrillan with between
50 and 76 served in each place 
There are two workers in Merrillan 
Pleasant View and one in the other
schools Melrose has no certified
woman worker and a man has charge
o f the work there Teachers throughout
the county assure Miss Webb 
county superintendent that the hot
lunches have apparently taken the
jitters out o f their students during
the afternoon Many o f the rural
schools also serve a hot dish although
not under a project 
The borrower who can get the financing
which he needs from his bank or
any private institution is not eligible
for FSA loans the supervisor
said 
All applications for loans must be
made at the Jackson county A AA o ffice
in the basement o f the new court
house Black River Falls 
According to the eligibility requirements
outlined by Mr Curran 
loans to cooperate in the A A A program
will be made only to farmers

to finance the purchase o f the materials
necessary in order to carry out
soil building practices; ( 2 ) farmers
whom the county A AA committee recommend
from the standpoint o f
character and integrity; (3 ) farmers
who agree to use the full amount o f

COUNTY A G E N T NOTES
Soil Erosion Short Course
The first soil erosion short course
to be held in the U S by any College
o f Agriculture was held at Madison
last week from Monday through Saturday
noon The purpose o f the
course was to teach the fundamentals
o f soil erosion prevention and control
methods insofar as practices might be
carried out by individual farmers 
Those attending the course from
Jackson county were: Stanley Dettinger 
Gaylord Jacobson Howard
Prindle and Brice Humphrey 
The program for the week consisted
o f classroom work on crop rotations 
fertilizers strip cropping gully
control methods terracing pasture
management and selection o f trees 
The forenoon o f each day was spent
working with different types o f levels
used in laying out terraces and strips
for strip cropping 
Sheep
Several sheep owners have asked
concerning the possibility o f organizing
a sheep dipping ring for those
farmers who would be interested in
having their sheep dipped at a very
reasonable cost Such dipping rings
have been operating in several counties
for two years and have proven
very practical Most counties use
portable outfits which can easily be
mover from farm to farm The cost
o f dipping under this organized plan
is only a few cents per head 
Beekeepers
Due to the fact that most o f the
roads were blocked last Wednesday 
it was decided to postpone the beekeepers
meeing until Wednesday April
1 2 
James Gwin o f the Department of
Agriculture and Markets will be here
on the above date to discuss diseases

ST A TE TO IM PROVE
L IB R A R Y SITUATION
Free public library service forms
an indispensable part o f any wellrounded
program o f community life 
Every American citizen from childhood
to old age should have a publicly
supported library Books should
be acceptable to a ll; readers o f all
ages should be served 
The depression bringing increased
demands for service from a public
who had more time to read only revealed
the need more strongly and
increased the importance o f the task
Wisconsin libraries have sought to
perform free public library service
to every man woman and child in
the state 
But with this increased demand for
service came reduced appropriations
and lowered budgets and librarians
all over the state found themselves
overwhelmed with opportunities for
service with only curtailed funds to
meet the challenge 
At the present time 904 956 people
or 31 per cent o f the total population
o f Wisconsin have no local public
library service o f any kind while
the other 69 per cent have many libraries
so inadequately equipped
with books and staff that they cannot
meet the needs o f those who wish to
use them 
Three entire Wisconsin counties
have no library service whatsoever
while in 39 counties only half the residents
are served by public libraries 
The American Library Association
recommends 1 0 0 per capita as the
minimum at which effective library
service can be maintained Massachusetts
leads with an expenditure o f
 1 08 while Wisconsin ranks 13th
among the states operating on 4 4
per capita 
A statewide movement has been
begun to improve and extend library
facilities throughout the state

 How! He chalk kolo!
Well my good people another
week has passed and we are that
much closer to spring and when it
does come I hope we will all make
good use o f it by doing fo r others
more than we expect others to do for
us The Boy Scouts have got the
right idea of the fundamental structure
o f the true human relationship
in the following scout oath which 1
will translate into the Winnebago
language 
 On my honor I will do my best
 Woysh sliak ha nee nay kee J a w 
shay l ee iia na kee zhay skay hocknay 
n 
 To do my duty to God and my
country   W oe lay J ay koo wa keeook

at all times  wa k ee gee day kchay

The other part o f this Scout oath
we will have next week 
Just a few words in reference to
the Wisconsin Winnebago Claim committee
mentioned in this column last
week This committee is the official
organ of the Winnebago tribe here
in Wisconsin and it is composed of
members o f the tribe representing
six ditterent districts o f Indian settlements 
Black River Falls district is
represented by the writer as president
of the committee and Fred Kingswan 
counselor 
The Tomah district is represented
by James Smoke secretary o f the
committee and Scott Mokey treasurer 
Mauston district is represented
by Kay Goodbear as counselor Wittenberg
district being represented by
Albert Big Thunder and Nathaniel
Decorah Wisconsin Rapids district
is represented by Frank Lincoln and
the late Chief A White The La
Crosse district including the Minnesota
settlement has Gilbert Lowe as
representative and the late William
Hopinkah was also a representative
of this district The committee was
organized back in 1928 The committee
men being elected by the tribal
members present at the general
meetings called by the Indian agent
at the Tomah school auditorium 
The Indian agency at lom ah thru
which the U S Government is to
take care o f its wards has done very
little to bring about better living
conditions for the Indians under its
jurisdiction Years back when there
was an agency for each tribe very
little was accomplished for the Indians 
Today the Tomah Agency has
under its jurisdiction other reservation
Indians besides the Winnebagoes
o f central Wisconsin What can the
agent accomplish now going from one
tribe to another Nothing much to
be sure Thinking seriously over the
situation one comes to the conclusion
that the relative combination o f the
Indian agency and the different counties
in which the Indians reside can
be very much likened to the monkey
and the cat in the kindergarten story 
The cat was burning its paws
pulling chestnuts out o f the red hot
bed o f coals while the monkey sat
back eating the nutritious kernels In
the last 2 0 years what has the agency
done for the Indians What has the
Indian Bureau done for the Indians
Very little if anything at all What
were the Indian Bureau officials and
semi officials doing at the outset of
the disastrous depression o f the last
six or so years when the various womens
clubs o f this city and surrounding
towns were doing the best they
could to meet  difficult situation
What did the Indian Bureau officials
do when the American Legion Post of
Alma Center was distributing fresh
meat and other supplies The Indian
Bureau continued to receive appropriations
from Congress and the Indian
Bureau officials and employees
continued to receive their monthly
salaries while doing nothing to help
the Indians who were under their
guardianship The state and the
counties womens clubs and the
American Red Cross were staggering
under a prodigious labod load getting
nothing in return for all their troubles
and sacrifices 
How much more these charitable
institutions could have accomplished
if they had all the money that was
expended for the maintenance o f the

If the white people were under

today its not the Indian Bureau
that is doing the looking after Its

W E E K L Y LETTER
When the governments stock o f
gold in the vaults in the hills o f Kentucky
reached the amount o f twelve
billions o f dollars the experts advised
that the limit had been arrived at 
That was nearly half the gold supply
o f the entire world But the pile of
gold grows larger monthly It now is
worth over fourteen billions and in
another four months it will exceed
fifteen billions The receipts for February
were 223 000 000 mostly
from Europe Russia and Cape Colony 
where the cost o f producing gold
is less than half our market price are
profiting enormously sharing the
gains with the London and Paris
bankers who take their toll as the
gold passes through their hands on
the way here 
Not all the fourteen billions o f gold
were bought at present prices Nearly
half o f it was on hand or was taken
dn from our citizens when the gold
act was passed in 1933 That which
was taken from the home folks was
bought at the old price The government
made a paper profit o f two billions
o f dollars when the increased
price was ordered and that now
forms the stabilization fund with
which our Treasury department uses
to stabilize currencies in the London
and Paris markets as well as our securities
in our home markets As
foreign gold has mixed with our new
production and that turned in under
government orders no estimates are
furnished as to the difference in
amounts received by our citizens and
that paid to foreigners 
For more than a year Treasury experts
have been figuring and explaining
the possible effect upon our own
future and that of other countries of
this vast accumulation o f the yellow
metal Some say it may lead to currency
and credit expansion when the
boom starts and consequent inflation
to a dangerous point After all the
argument and discussion it seems certain 
however that the flow o f foreign
gold will continue Were war to occur
in Europe probably it would increase
so rapidly as to unbalance the
currency values o f half or more o f
the countries o f the world 
Some fifty millions o f this gold
will be loaned to Brazil to stabilize
its exchange and permit that country
to pay for the commodities it
buys from Europe as well as from our
own country Another fifty millions
o f credit will be loaned to Brazil by
the export and import bank borrowed
from our federal Treasury to enable
Brazil to buy more o f our products 
Negotiations for these loans were
brought through by the Brazilian
minister o f foreign affairs who has
been here several weeks 
As usual when a South American
or European country comes borrowing 
their promises are liberal and enticing 
In this instance the promise is
more trade and more profits to those
who sell to Brazil Incidentally the
Brazilians promise to look into the
matter o f other loans obtained in
times past to see if there may not
be some way through which it may
at least pay some interest on its debt
to our people Brazilian bonds to the
amount o f 327 000 000 are now
held by our investors in which there
is default in the payment o f both interest
and installments on the principal 
In the aggregate the indebtedness
amounts to more than 400 000 000 
The additional loan will bring it beyond
the half billion dollar mark If
and when pay day comes Brazil will
return the money If it never comes 
Brazil will be ahead that half billion
o f good hard earned savings o f our
people 
A fter years o f endeavor on the
part o f western dairymen to bring
to the front the issue as to embargoes
which shut Wisconsin and other western
milk and cream from the big
cities may be successful The city of
Washington through the action of
its commissioners has placed new and
added restrictions on its milk and
cream supply To provide the fanfare
for impressing consumers in this
city o f the reason for this new regulation 
a truck load o f Indiana cream
was confiscated under the claim that
the cream was  unlicensed and was
being  bootlegged into town to the
great damage to the health o f the
people Upon inspection the cream
proved to be just as pure and good
in quality as that which is furnished
by the local monopoly distributors 
The arrest o f the driver however 
furnished the cover under which the
new regulations were imposed

PERSO NALS
This same procedure has been followed
in other big cities as the big
dairy product monopolies have increased
their hold upon the milk supply 
Under the system one big city
after another has fallen into the
clutches o f the milk monopolies But 
this time Congress is taking hold 
After a long fight the House has appointed
a special committee to investigate
the milk supply o f the national
capital A move to open up the whole
question o f monopoly in connection
therewith was defeated by parliamentary
rulings but a start has been
made and other steps will follow 
It was in 1923 that Wall street
operators and promoters including a
bunch o f investment bankers discovered
the plan o f making many millions
through monopolizing the milk
business It was not the first raid of
the stock market bulls upon the barnyards
o f the country but it has been
one o f the most successful Great
corporations floated stocks and bonds
and bought up the dairy plants and
pasteurizing stations in the larger
cities one after another City health
authorities provided  health regulations
which have furthered the control 
Some corporations increased
their capital twenty fold in a decade
in addition to making dividends o f
600 per cent upon their original capital
in the same period In some cities
a single monopoly controls 73 per
cent o f the milk supply In Chicago
92 firms and individuals are under
indictment for ruthless monopolistic
methods in violation o f the anti trust
laws The situation in Chicago is not
different from that o f other cities 
The investigation by the House committee
may disclose that Washington

MERLIN HULL 
COM M ISSIONERS AND CU LVERTS
O H Overlien has been county
highway commissioner for some 25
years One o f the first things he
did after his inauguration was to
build some drop inlets on culverts as
a prevention o f erosion The idea
was entirely his own Nobody thought
much o f it or wanted any share in
its responsibility That didnt make
much difference to O H He just
went about his business built his culverts
and sat back to see if they
worked Apparently they did The
first ones are still on the job 
He acquired the idea for his culverts
from watching the water wash
down Price Hill then unpaved and
be carried away without much damage
through the street drain at the
corner by the court house He built
his first drop inlets near the Albert
Gilbertson farm in the town o f Irving
and near what was then the Ed Holven
place in Squaw Creek He has
used the idea in many parts o f the
county since 
January 24 1939 R H Musser o f
the U S Department o f Agriculture 
Soil Conservation Service delivered
an address on soil conservation in
highway construction and maintenance
at the 28th annual road school
at Milwaukee The following extract
from the address is o f particular interest
locally:
He had been talking about the fact
that Wisconsin folks have been conscious
o f the proble m of erosion control
in connection with highway work
for some time and have been doing
excellent work along that line He be
lieved that most o f the practices that
are considered practical for erosion
control were being demonstrated in
Wisconsin and went on to say
 In fact I understand that Wis
consin has been doing some highway
erosion control work for many
years Our state coordinator M F 
Schweers whom many o f you know 
was telling me the other day about
Olaus Overlien (pronounced O louse
Overline) county highway commissioner
over in Jackson county Mr 
Overlien as I understand it has
been using risers or drop inlets on
culverts for the past 25 years and
when Mr Schweers asked him why
he had been using them he gave
three reasons: first because they
protect the road ditches; second because
they prevent gullies from eating
back into farm land destroying
it and thus decreasing the tax base;
and third because they cost little
more than the construction o f a longer
culvert which would be necessary
were it not for the drop inlet 
In 1937 Dr Alexis H Garin of
the United States Department o f Agriculture 
came here from Washington
and spent three days with O H 
traveling over the county and examining
the work 
Olaus was told he was crazy and
has taken a lot o f razzing about that
idea o f his but as he says  I didnt
give a whoop I didnt know enough
I suppose And now within the last
few years the state highway commission
has been building the same type
o f culverts And recently he received
a message stating:  Tell him the
Federal government has gone crazy
too that they are going to take it
up 
That should be honor enough for
one red headed road commissioner but
it is all in the days work to him He
ambles amiably around with his hands
in his pockets and yes we more than
susject a copious cul o f Copenhagen
in occupancy Miss Duxbury deputy
in his office does not have a cuspidor
in her room She knows something
about erosion too When necessary
Commissioner Overlien steps into the
next room to an office size drop outlet
and then returns to pick up the
conversation where he left it suspended 
We wish he had been crazy enough
to patent that culvert idea 25 years
ago or so Crazy like a fox

C O O PE R A TIV E NEW S
The Cooperative farm machinery
plant at Arthurdale West Virginia 
is nearing completion Machinery is
being installed and it is beginning to
assume the proportions o f  bee hive
activity The first tractor will come
off the assembling lines April 1st 
This new factory plant and equipment
is a completely modem establishment
and will have some 30 000
square feet o f floor space The various
cooperative stockholder member
associations are the Farm Bureau
Services; Indiana Farm Bureau Cooperatives;
Farmers Union Central
Exchange; Consumers Cooperatives;
and others representing a combined
market outlet o f over 17 000 000 00
annually 
Aside from the manufacture o f
Co op tractors and auxiliary equipment 
negotiations are being carried
on to include the manufacturing and
marketing o f other essential farm implements
including the Rust Cotton
Picker 
For many years past the high price
o f farm machinery has been a
 thorn in the side o f the American
farmer and if the cooperatives o f the
nation can bring the price o f farm
implements down to a parity o f what
the farmers receive for their produce
they will be doing a great service to
the welfare o f the nation 
It was interesting to note last fall
shortly after the plans o f this Coop 
machinery plant was announced there
was a general reduction in the prices
o f the leading makes o f farm machinery
o f 5 to 15 per cent How much
further they will be reduced remains
to be seen 
The annual meeting o f the Jackson
county Cooperative Advancement Association
will be held at the court
house Saturday March 25th at 1 :30

OUTLOOK FOR FARM JOBS
During the next two months we
can look forward in a more optimistic
mood to an increase in employment
o f farm labor Although farm
prices are comparatively low the
figures on farm placements for the
past two years have been rather
steady and it is expected that this
spring and summer will prove no exception 
It is also anticipated that
farm labor will demand about the
same wages as those paid in 1938 
Calls for farm help are already beginning
to drift into the La Crosse
office o f the Wisconsin State Employment
Service although it is expected
that they will not reach their
peak until the latter part o f March
and April 
To those farmers who are contemplating
the hiring o f extra help for
the spring work we wish to extend
an invitation to use our service as
we have some very cajable farm applicants
registered with us 
To those who have registered but
have not renewed their applications
we suggest that they come in and
make themselves available for work
if they wish to be considered for
farm jobs We have also several calls
for farm couples and we suggest that
persons interested in filling such jobs
should file application 
In our outlying counties the La
Crosse district office o f the Wisconsin
State Employment Service is represented
by the local Public Welfare
departments Those who wish
to register for farm labor and those
interested in securing help should
contact the Public Welfare department
office in their county 
In Jackson county the public welfare
department is under the direction
o f Ruth L Zodtner and is located
in the Jackson County Court
House in Black River Falls

(B y Cornelius A Harper M D 
State Health Oofficer)
Children today are getting and
following better advice on care o f
the teeth than any generation before
them 
Results a nation with better
teeth better general health more
reason to smile and with smiles that
ahe easier to look at 
For more than two years the state
board o f health has employed a dentist 
Dr Francis A Bull to devote
full time to the encouragement of
better dental health in Wisconsin 
Since entering on this work Dr 
Bull has written two leaflets on his
subject one for expectant mothers
and mothers o f preschool children 
the other for young school children 
Through the convenient medium of
the public school system these leaflets
are being distributed as widely as
 ossible They are written in plain
anguage and what they tell you to
do doesnt require money so much as
conscientious care 
A diet that contains plenty of
milk fresh fruits and vegetables plus
extra vitamin D and restricted in
carbohydrates does something that
prevents tooth decay in children and
in adults as well 
The right sort o f diet should be
accompanied by the right sort o f
mouth hygiene o f course Daily
brushing o f the teeth is essential and
within the reach o f all when it is realized
that a mixture o f equal parts
o f table salt and baking soda provides
a reasonably effective toothpowder 
A
lso essential in maintaining sound
teeth is a periodic checkup by your
dentist In a number o f Wisconsin
cities and counties dental hygienists
are employed to make such inspections
among school children a procedure
that has gained remarkable results
