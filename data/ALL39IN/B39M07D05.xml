Those who were responsible for the grand success of the
Centennial Celebration and Home Coming are certainly entitled
to the hearty congratulations of the ten or twelve thousand people
who had such a wonderful time through their endeavors Their
program for all three days was excellent It was well planned and
well carried out Black River Falls has had many pleasant events
in the first hundred years of its history None ever surpassed in
interest or entertainment that which closed with an audience of at
least 8 000 people on the crowded Fair Grounds last night Those
wrho gave so unsparingly of their time and labor to provide three
days of solid enjoyment to others have the thanks of the community
and all its many guests 
The number of those directly participating in the program
is not known Fully 300 were engaged in the management 
program and pageant As many more were participants in the parade
and in providing the floats and decorations The bands ballplayers 
police force and scores more of workers all contributing
their part probably made the celebration forces number seven or
eight hundred people There were many to whom special notice or
honors are due The Lions Rotarians Business Women s Department
of the Woman s Club Knights of Pythias and numerous
other organizations which assumed large responsibilities for the
observance of the Centennial might W ell have a column were it
possible 
With all those who are so deserving of praise for their
plans and labors congratulations are just as much due to the community
in which can be found so many people of talent ingenuity 
public spirit and ideals of co operation The showT was remarkable 
and home folks and their guests alike will have a recollection
of it the remainder of their days Included in their memories of
the more active participants there also will be recognition of the
fact that Black River Falls and Jackson county folks can gather
in multitudes with a common interest in the skill talent and production
of their own and celebrate progress with warm hospitality 
good cheer and pleasant performance It is a time when we
all can shake hands with ourselves with joy for the kind of folks
we live among

deeply devoted wife and mother with
 an intense interest in her family and

The La Crosse Tribune o f Sunday
featured a story on the three day celebration
o f the Black River Valley
Centennial and along with it an editorial
on the occasion The story was
sent them by Mrs D W A Holder 
local correspondent for the Tribune 
and contains a lot o f interesting information 
Editorial and story follow 
B lack R iver Falls C elebrates Its
C entennial
Not many communities in the La
Crosse section o f Wisconsin have
reached their 100th birthday so it
is with unusual interest that all eyes
are turning the next three days towards
Black River Falls where a colorful
celebration has been arranged
to mark the centennial o f that settlement s
existence 
Probably no more suitable setting
could have been chosen for an event
o f this kind than the Black River
Valley notably picturesque and representative
o f the scenic Wisconsin
area The Valley is closely linked
with the history o f this entire region 
for it was there that the first inland
white settlers chose to locate and it
was from the massive logging industry
carried on along the Black River
that the thriving little communities
sprang up from Black River Falls to
the Mississippi river 
Little has been said in the history
books o f Wisconsin about the part
that this industry and the hardy pioneers
connected with it played in developing
the Wisconsin territory Perhaps
that was partly because few annals
o f the early days o f the Black
River Valley were kept and it has
been only through a most diligent research
on the part o f the community s
present citizens that much o f this
early life there has come to light 
Thanks to these patriotic citizens 
however the historical lore o f the
Jackson county region is gradually
being brought to light 
The celebration this week marking
the 100th anniversary o f the first
settlement o f Black River Falls will
contribute much towards dramatizing
the part that the Valley had in western
Wisconsin s settlement Among
high lights o f the event will be colorful
pageants depicting the life there
during the early years from the time
that the land still lay in the hands o f
the Indians until the white man had
taken over and subdued both the red
man and the land 
Observance o f an anniversary however 
does not ordinarily mean that
the end o f the book has been reached 
The first hundred years in the
Valley s history are but a chapter 
many others are yet to be written 
Enough time has elapsed during this
hundred year span to prove that the
stock comprising the foundation o f
this community is made o f stern
stu ff as the years go on the people
o f the Valley will frequently be
put to new tests 
With a sense o f optimism and hope
we look forward with them to a future
that may witness new growth 
both in tangible wealth and in the
enrichment o f the community character 
100th A n n iversa ry
The celebration marks the 100th
anniversary o f the first settlement
at Black River Falls and has behind
it an historical story as colorful as
any section o f Wisconsin That story
goes back to the period after the War
o f 1812 when migration from Atlantic
seaboard westward started 
Among those who came to Wisconsin
at that time was Col William S 
Hamilton son o f Alexander Hamilton 
Young William was seven years old at
this time William Hamilton had a
great deal to do with the early settlement
o f Wisconsin and Illinois He
was appointed U S deputy surveyor
o f public lands and by the end o f
1883 practically all south o f the
Wisconsin and west o f Rock river had
been surveyed A land office was established
at Mineral Point in 1843 
this being the city o f the largest population
in the state at that time 
The land was previously owned by
the Winnebagoes who didn t take the
coming o f the whites too kindly Silver
Mound 16 miles from Black
River Falls furnished material for
their arrow and spear heads knives
and other implements when the In
dians acquired the art o f chipping 
and members o f all tribes are supposed
to have come from was the belief 
that the Great Spirit intended
this for the use o f all so there was no
trouble between the tribes 
T reaties S igned
Chief Red Bird smeared his war
paint on back in 1827 and started a
little war o f his own down in Prairie
du Chien murdering some o f the
white settlers in that community This
show o f hostility called for a settlement 
and the result was that Red
Bird s flight ended in prison where
he died shortly afterward and his
accomplices were pardoned on the
condition that the Winnebagoes cede
the lead region to the government for
$60 000 A fter the Black Hawk war
o f 1832 another treaty was signed 
and more land ceded Again in 1837 
both the Winnebagoes and the Me
nominees ceded all right and claims
to their land east o f the Mississippi 
It was the Menominees who objected
most to the white settler in the Black
river valley and who proceeded to
make life miserable for them 
Records in Montreal show that the
first white people to come to the
Black river valley came from the
north but the first permanent settlers
o f the valley came up the river from
Prairie du Chien 
S ilver M ine Still L ost
Pierre Charles La Seuer in charge
o f the French fur trading post in
1695 was ordered to open trade

routes in the south and it is presumed
that he followed the Black river
to the Mississippi but he was so sure
he had found a silver mine in the valley
that he forgot about the routes
and the furs He didn t want anyone
to find his mine so made no notes
of the country La Seuer went to
France to get permission from the
king to develop the mine He fitted
out an expensive expedition and with
17 experienced miners came up the
Mississippi from New Orleans but
he never found his mine again and
his miners were killed by the Indians 
It was a general belief in bygone
years that there was a lost silver
mine in the Black river valley 
but to date it is still very much lost 
In 1850 a party o f miners from
St Louis made explorations at Silver
Mound and found evidences of
much earlier explorations but no silver 
Later geologists contend that
 Silver Mound is a misnomer 
In 1819 the Rolette saw mill the
first in Wisconsin was burned It
was located at The Falls and considered
the equal o f any in the
United States No settlers attempted
coming up the river until in 1839
when an expedition was fitted out at
Prairie du Chien to utilize the water
power at the Falls 
B uilt B oat in La C rosse
Robert and Andrew Wood were in
charge o f the expedition and found
La Crosse a naked prairie except for
Indian wigwams o f a temporary nature 
Here they stopped and built
a flat bottomed boat called a keel
boat 60 feet long and five feet wide 
to get their ten tons o f freight up
river They could make 20 miles a
day and arrived Aug 1 There were
28 head o f cattle which arrived about
the same time having been driven
through the wilderness from Illinois 
This was the beginning o f dairying
in Wisconsin The keel boat was the
only means o f getting in supplies for
years A fter building a log cabin 
the Wood crew got busy on a new
saw mill on Town creek near the
present McGillivray factory here 
Early settlers found wild game in
abundance in the valley including
elk deer and bears here at the time 
In 141 the Mormons arrived from
Nauvoo 111 and it was here they got
the lumber for their temple Jacob
Spaulding who came here with the
first expedition sold them a mill but
after Joseph Smith their founder 
was killed in 1844 they left the community
in a hurry and Mr Spaulding
again became owner o f the mill 
T ea ch ers G ot $12
The first school was started in
February 1847 with C R Johnson
as teacher at $12 per month and the
privilege o f eating around with the
parents Mr Johnson was the father
o f Frank Johnson for years county
judge o f Jackson county and his
daughter Mrs Laura Campbell now
resides in the old home here He was
a very influential citizen and we are
indebted to him for records o f the
early days When the Mexican war
broke out he left his teaching and
there was no school until he came
back He later was a captain in the
Civil war and filled many county o ffices
during his long life here 
The town o f Alma was made a
part o f La Crosse county for a period
o f one week from Feb 24 to Mar 
3 1857 and was transferred to
Jackson county again Jackson was
originally a part o f Crawford county 
and the northern part o f Monroe was
in Jackson county all a git confusing 
In 1843 a caravan crossed the region
that is now Jackson county from
the southeast to the northwest consisting
o f three wagons nine yoke o f
cattle three horses and 1 men They
left Prairie du Chien May 24 bound
for La Pointe on Madeline Island in
Lake Superior This was the first
time a wagon was used in this county 
and was the first overland trip o f the
pioneer They passed near where Viroqua
and Cashton now stand 
O ne M an G ets L ost
One man wandered away from the
caravan and after searching for him
one day the rest o f the party went
on never knowing what happened to
him but think he went to the village
of La Crosse They were joined by a
lumberman headed for Black River
Falls whom they allowed to pilot
them but he was mistaken on his directions
and took them around by Tomah
and they soon found they were
five miles north o f Black River Falls 
The Mormons were then getting out
their lumber for their temple 
The expedition was lead by the first
Methodist preacher in Wisconsin bom
in Danbury Conn in 1793 when
Washington was president He founded
a mission with the Sioux near Ft 
Snelling This was the Rev Alfred
Brunson His son Benjamin and his
son in law Mr Bass later bought out
the mills at Chippewa Falls and his
son Ira surveyed the original town
site o f La Crosse the year previous to
this expedition

LA CROSSE MINTS LOSE
AT CENTENNIAL 9 TO 2
The La Crosse Mint team sporting
such stars as Cihosz recently of
the Philadelphia Phillies and a coal
complected gentleman o f the Piney
Woods school named Taylor were
just another ball club to the Merchants
at the fair grounds in a setto
played in commemoration o f the
time a hundred years ago when a
band o f our paleface forebears started
to muscle in on territory held by
the proud Winnebagoes The palepussed
gents must have come out
ahead in that original skirmish because
several thousand were on hand
pitching rings knocking over metal
milk bottles eating hot dogs and
riskng their fool necks on loop oplanes
and other contrivances designed
to remove the coin o f the realm
from the unsuspecting purse Most
o f the folks on hand also watched
the Merchant ball team throw the
visiting Mint club for a 9 to 2 loss 
The two tallies captured by La
Crosse men came about on a pair
of miscues and were both chalked up
as unearned giving Rudolph a total
of 26 innings since an unblemished
tally has been scored against him The
first o f the enemy counts came in the
7th Cihosz stopped one o f Rude s
fast balls with his slats for a base
and Swan lined a hit to center Lozier
hit a ground ball to short but the
reliable Teeples didn t get a hold of
the pill before he threw it so it rolled
into right and Cihosz scored The
second and final run was coined by
the Mints in the ninth Shroeded
started it with a hit but was wiped
off on a fielders choice by Mollock 
The latter went to second on a passed
ball and home when the pellet was
thrown wild in an attempt to nail Cihosz
going into second on Lozier s
fielders choice 
Nine runs had been sent home by
the Merchants before any the above
transpired so it didn t really make
much difference The Black River
boys started off gently by gathering
a single count in 4th Hits by Teeples
and A Rudolph and a fielders
choice by Hoard were the ingredients
used 
In the 6th the Falls hombres busted
loose like the flood o f 1911 
cracked out eight hits had Hauser hit
in the batters box by an undomesticated
offering by Lozier and had one
error mixed into the flurry 
Teeples got things going by beating
out a perfect bunt Then Art
Rudolph Hoard Hauser and Neidf 
ldt followed with hits Adams whiffed
for the first out and everybody
was safe on a fielder s choice by E 
Rudolph Randles and Kleven kept
the pow wow going by sizzling a pair
o f hits over the keystone bag Teeples
was retired on a foul to first but
Art bashed his second hit o f the inning
into right Hoard survived on
a fumble by Selke and Hauser was
hit by the pitcher and the baseball 
The slaughter ended when Neidfeldt
popped out to Lozier pitching for
Baker who had read the handwriting
on the wall and sought the refuge
o f the bench to anoint his troubled
soul 
Although Rude wasn t exactly in
top form there wasn t any real damage
done to his delivery and eight
hit pitching isn t so bad except for
Ernie Art kept the family reputation
up to snuff however by getting
four hits and a walk for a perfect
day at the dish 
A fter the Wednesday game with
the Eau Claire Pressure Cooker aggregation 
the Merchantmen will test
the power o f the highly rated Richland
Center team in a night game
here on Sunday July 9th

WISCONSIN S HEALTH
(B y Cornelius A Harper M D 
State Health Officer)
The one time captain o f the men
of death tuberculosis is only a corporal
now and still slipping 
Last year s tuberculosis deaths in
Wisconsin fell below 1 000 for the
first time in state history and fell so
far below that they fell below 900
as well totaling but 899 in the official
tabulation 
This marked a 10 per cent decrease
in tuberculosis deaths in one year 
Even more startling was the fact
that this sharp decrease did not occur
in tuberculosis deaths at ages under
j 20 years but among older people In
the age group 40 to 59 years almost
80 per cent o f last year s decrease
 was effected 
With local tuberculosis testing programs
and follow up work in progress
among our young people on a
more extensive scale than ever before 
it is reasonable to predict that further
decreases in tuberculosis deaths
are in store for Wisconsin 
Tuberculosis is usually one o f the
slowest diseases to develop in the human
body It has to depend partly
upon weakened resistance in the individual 
By the same token the
cure and the prevention o f tuberculosis
are slow procedures In this
way prevention work carried on this
year may not have the full effect upon
the mortality tables until a great
many years have passed 
If that be so then probably this
magnificent reduction o f 10 per cent
in tuberculosis deaths in Wisconsin
last year was due to anti tuberculosis
measures carried on during the last
generation 
It is appropriate to recall perhaps 
that in 1908 our state board o f health
sent an exhibit to the International
Congress on Tuberculosis at Washington 
where it was awarded first place
as portraying the best law enacted by
any state or county for the prevention
and control o f the disease

REEDSBURG 7TH MERCHANT
VICTIM 6 TO 0
Manager E Rudolph and his band
o f hosshiders took their bucket of
whitewash along with them to Reedsburg
last Thursday and splashed an
alabaster coat o f the liquid all over
the leaders o f the Scenic Wisconsin
League The downstaters are proud
of their ball club think they are pretay
hot stuff so Rude cooled em off
with the aforesaid batch o f whitewash 
Only four hits all singles 
were gleaned off the Merchant mound
sters chucking Two o f these basenoks
came in the 7th after two had
had lilies placed on their bosoms for
the only semblance o f a threat to
score Only one Burgher got as far
as third and only two had a chance
to hobnob with Arthur Rudolph at 2d 
Maybe the boys wouldn t have been
so tough on their hosts if the Reedsburg
entry hadn t hinted that Black
River was to be slapped for a row o f
garbage containers to avenge the only
defeat hung on the Scenic Leaguers
this season As it turned out Ernie
poured his Smoker past the enemy
albeit he was aided by some absolutely
sensational stops by Ellison and a
running back handed catch by Randles
which Ward pulled in somewhere
around Sheboygan Ward got a good
hand on the play from the foes customers 
The first and winning run was
turned in in the first Randles beat
out a hit but was sunk for attempted
banditry on second Kleven walked
and was successful in burgling the
keystone bag whereupon A Slugger 
Rudolph propelled a hit into
center enabling Hank to spike the
plate with his No 11s with what proved
to be the only tally needed Two
more Merchants counted in the 4th 
Hoard started a rally by getting
plunked on his corns by one o f Harper s
low pitches Hauser lined a hit
to center Hoard going to 2d A
fielders choice resulted in the demise
o f Royce at 3rd Randles smote a
single into left and Hauser came
home Teeples drew free transportation
to first loading the paths and
Adams came home as Randles was being
retired at 2d on a fielders choice
by A Rudolph 
Nothing else happened until the
7th when a pass to Ellison and successive
hits by Rudy and Hoard counted
the 4th guest run The scoring
part o f the show was concluded in
the forepart o f the 7th when the
Umpe guessed right on the 4th ball to
 er Mr Adams Ladi Larry was
retired at 2d on Randles fielders
choice Kleven singled on a slow boupcer
to 3rd and Teeples crashed a hit
over 2d both Randles and Kleven tallying
when McGarrity let the pellet
get away on a play to get Hank at
3rd and that was the works

The Wisconsin Rural Electric Cooperative
Association bill to amend
the cooperative law passed the assembly
Tuesday by a vote o f 79 to 2
and was sent to the senate for concurrence 
The bill eases the requirements
for a quorum at Coop membership
meetings and also makes it easier
for a coop to ammend its articles
o f incorporation It also provides
that a city or other government units
may become a member o f a Coop as
was explained in June 14th issue o f
the Banner Journal 
The Cooperative League o f the U 
S A is establishing an office in
Washington D C not that the cooperatives
o f the United States are
going into politics but rather to keep
an eye on national legislation 
Cooperatives as a way toward higher
living standards for the south were
discussed by the recent conference in
cooperation at Greenville South Carolina 
 Educating People to Help
Themselves was the theme o f the
three days o f discussion Taking
part were some 300 people from ten
southern states representing churches
and labor union farm cooperatives 
government universities and schools 
The Chinese Industrial Cooperatives
prompted by the Chinese government
has established 500 coops in less
than nine months The goal as seen
by Rewi Alley the New Zealander 
who has the work in charge is 30 000
Coops The Cooperative Builder
goes on to say The Coops turn out
a great variety o f goods from tooth
brushes and matches to boats and
sub machine guns At first the Coops
were not pushed in the areas held by
the former Communist armies The
private business elements were not
anxious to see the Coops spread especially
in places where the Communists
have already sowed seeds o f distrust 
with the profit system But now
the Coops are being promoted in
these areas also for the need is urgent 
to take care o f refuges make
supplies for the soldiers and keep
the people from buying Japanese
goods

The Trout Irving Co op Study club
met a tthe home o f Mr and Mrs A 
L Gilbertson last Tuesday evening 
The topic for study and discussion
was Problems o f a Cooperative 
Credit was brought out as one perplexing
problem which is trying to be
solved It was also brought out that
difficulties arise from the lack o f understanding 
which our Co op study
club can enlighten us on More people
should make use o f this source o f
education that is constructively outlined 
A report o f the study club conference 
which was held at the West Hotel
June 12th representing Minnesota
and Wisconsin was given by our
delegate Earl Horswill 
A director Harvey Gilbertson explained
the problems o f our local
Co op Oil Co and how they were
met which was very interesting

lunch and all went home with an enlightened
interest and personal responsibility
to our cooperatives

Avast majority o f the conservationists
in Wisconsin who are acquainted
with the work and accomplishments
o f the Conservation Commission
were keenly disappointed
when Governor Heil failed to reappoint
Robert B Goodman to the Conservation
Commission but very few
o f these same people are finding any
fault with his recent appointment o f
William J P Aberg o f Madison 
Mr Aberg has been demonstrating
his unselfish interest in conservation
over a period o f many years by his
activities and efforts in every worthy
conservation cause that has come to
life both in this state or in the nation 
He combines judgment foresight
and vision with soundness and
stability and these are the things
that count in the long pull for conservation 
His work and his reputation in
conservation matters have been recognized
not only in his own state but
nationally The Federal Government
has seen fit at times to put him on
important advisory boards Mr 
Aberg was one time president o f the
state division o f the Izaak Walton
League and his work in that capacity
was recognized by the national organization
so that he was made chairman
o f the National Executive Board 
When the Wildlife Federation of
America was organized the middle 
When an appointee to the conservation
commission is a man who has
little or no conservation background
he has to sit on the commission several
years getting educated By the
time he finds out what it is all about
his term is up a new man may be
appointed and someone else has to be
educated Aberg comes with complete
learning in conservation and the
presence o f this outstanding man on
the commission will certainly give the
people o f the state more confidence
in that body

The soliliquy of a modern Hamlet
would go something like this 
 T B or not T B that is the question
 
Whether tis nobler in the lungs to
suffer
The rales and raspings o f contagious
phthisis

And by due treatment end them 
 Tis
A consumption devoutly to be shunned
 
When he himself might his quietus

Nearly alt individuals are susceptible
to tuberculosis and children are
much more likely to become infected
than older people Very few children 
however have active tuberculosis 
The period in which latent tuberculosis
usually becomes active is the latter
part o f the teens and early twenties 
W
isconsin s present tuberculosis
prevention program is based on the
conviction that every child who has
reached the age o f 12 years should
receive the tuberculin test a simple
and painless procedure by which those
who are susceptible to the disease are
identified and do thus place the further
quest for active cases on a practical
basis 
More than 50 000 rural Wisconsin
children received the tubercu in test
last year Our state s urban population
is approximately the same as the
rural and similar activity against tuberculosis
is reported from our cities 
This fight is going on steadily with
heartening results

 Sacrament will be the subject of
the Lesson Sermon read in Churches
o f Christ Scientist throughout the
world on Sunday July 9 
The Golden Text is taken from
Psalms 5 1 10 
 Create in me a clean heart O
G od and renew a right spirit within
me 
The following citation from the Bible
is included in the Lesson Sermon 
 And as they were eating Jesus
took bread and blessed it and brake
it and gave it to the disciples and
said Take eat this is my body And
he took the cup and gave thanks 
and gave it to them saying Drink ye
all o f it For this is my blood o f the
new testament which is shed for
many for the remission o f sins ( Matthew
26 26 28) 
The Lesson Sermon includes the
following correlative passage from
the Christian Science textbook Science
and Health with Key to The
Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy 
 The true sense is spiritually lost 
if the sacrament is confined to the
use o f bread and wine The disciples
had eaten yet Jesus prayer and gave
them bread This would have been
foolish in a literal sense but in its
spiritual signification it was natural
and beautiful Jesus grayed he withdrew
from the material senses to refresh
his heart with brighter with
spiritual views (p 32)

Back in 1893 President Cleveland
called a special session o f Congress
to repeal the Silver Purchase Act 
under which the government was buying
about fifty million ounces o f silver
annually He believed that the
purchase act was one o f the causes
o f the depression which was called
 the panic o f the nineties The
senate did not yield to his demands 
and a filibuster against the repeal
lasted for months in that body Eventually 
Mr Cleveland won out but
the depression lasted for five years
thereafter 
Silver had been an issue before
Congress and before the country for
many years before that and repeal of
the purchase act did not end the
fight The battle for the free and
unlimited coinage o f silver became
the leading issue of 1896 when William
Jennings Bryan lost the presidency
by a scant half million votes
on the issue The gold standard was
firmly established when McKinley
was elected president In various
forms the issue has popped up in
the intervening years and it continues
to be important especially in the
silver producing sections o f the westemstates 
Not in many years has the issue
of silver purchases been so prominently
to the fore as it has been in the
Senate the past couple o f weeks A
bloc o f senators from the silver states
has been making a fight for increasing
the price the government pays
for silver from 64 to 77 Vi cents
per ounce Under the former price
the government has bought more than
a billion ounces o f the white metal 
Not much o f it has been coined however 
except into minor coins The
bulk o f it has been stored away in
a million dollar storage vault built
for that special purpose near the Military
academy at West Point Under
the law the Treasury may issue silver
certificates at a valuation o f
$1 29 per ounce and such certificates
are about the only form of
government currency now in circulation 
Other currency is issued mainly
as Federal Reserve bank notes Under
present laws the President has authority
to order the issue o f such certificates
to the amount o f three billion
dollars against the big silver
hoard but he has not availed himself
o f the privilege 
The Silver bloc in the Senate 
mainly administration senators after
battling a couple o f weeks succeeded
in obtaining their demand for an increase
o f 13 cents per ounce on government
silver purchases and at the
same time stopping the purchase of
foreign silver The world price o f silver
has been about 43 cents per
ounce and at 64 cents silver from
Mexico India China and South
American countries has been flowing
in constituting a big part o f that held
in storage Those countries have profited
by hundreds o f millions through
our government purchases just as
foreign countries producing gold have
made even more millions while our
government has been piling up twothirds
all the gold in the world in the
Kentucky hills 
In 1894 Cleveland had to turn to
the Republican minority in the Senate 
mostly gold standard senators to
obtain the yote to repeal the purchase
act o f that period The vicissitudes o f
politics and political expediency are
frequently illustrated in Congress as
well as in other legislative bodies 
There were many Republican senators
who desired to prevent the extension
o f the law permitting the President
to further devalue the gold dollar
from 59 cents which he fixed in 1933 
to as low as 50 cents The two blocs
united and both won their point The
final battle will occur when a conference
committee reports to both House
and Senate The President denounces
the political trading which accomplished
the dual policies to both
o f which he is opposed The silver
question and the money question seem
to be always ready to become important
issues though in a century congress
has failed to establish a permanent
policy as to either 
The immediate effect of this senatorial
clash and its consequences has
been to create a panic in the silver
markets o f the world That means
little to our own country where producers
will gain 13 cents per pound 
but it will be rather devastating to
Mexico which has been thriving to
the point o f great prosperity by our
generous purchases o f its immense
silver output at 21 cents above world
markets And a further effect has
been noticed in foreign capitals as
well as in our own financial centers
as to the unsettling of our present
gold policy 
Hot weather in Washington seems
to be a prolific breeder o f new issues 
There was to be no tax legislation at
this session according to the leaders 
but early in June the question bobbed
up and a new tax bill was passed 
Neutrality has been under discussion
for six months The senate balked at
repeal o f mandatory provisions as to
sales o f war munitions to belligerent
countries and other proposed changes 
so the House Committee on Foreign
Affairs tackled the job Belatedly a
bill comes forth bearing the title o f
neutrality but in reality defining how
far we shall go in furnishing the materials
for an international massacre 
Under its provisions and there are
several o f them the power would be
placed in the President to select and
define our neutrility in such form as
to favor some countries as against
others The measure is offered by the
State department but some o f the
features have occasioned such opposition
that amendments were offered
even before it came up for discussion 
The best form o f neutrality is to keep
away from foreign war keep our
money and materials out o f it and
only by that policy can we make sure
o f keeping our country and our soldiers
out o f whatever may happen
abroad 
Then came the new lending proposal
o f the President to finance
various forms o f public works and
enterprises over a term o f years by
means o f insured loans to be made
by banks and other financial corporations
for the projects The plan proposes
to avoid further grants such as

The young people will make their

is employed 
have been available under PW A and
WPA the loans to be made repayable
over a long term o f years The
measure has not yet been perfected
and presented and discussion of
many o f its features must be only
o f a general nature The government
has been following the insured loan
policy for H O L C Federal Housing 
TVA and numerous other great
projects It now is backing more than
five billions o f such loans thus far
without material losses 
Included in his proposal the president
advocates loans o f five hundred
millions to foreign countries with
which to expand our foreign trade 
The explosion o f objections to that
proposal indicates that it will have
a hard road to cover in getting
through Congress With twelve billions
unpaid war loans three billions
moje o f defaulted loans made to European
countries after the war and
more than one billion o f loans to
South American countries in default
on both principal and interest it does
not seem wise to many to throw good
money to follow the bad loans already
made The total o f defaulted
loans made by our country and its
people to foreign countries is equal
to half the amount o f our national
debt possibly even more than that 
if figures were available

A D Polleys o f Melrose holds the
record as a regular voter We have
had the cut o f him taken at the last
election for some time and take this
opportunity o f passing it and his record
along He is well known as
may be seen by the accompanying
article which appeared in the Melrose
Chronicle 
In a state wide oldest voters contest 
sponsored by a Milwaukee publication
in 1934 Mr Polleys won first
place by reason o f having voted at
every election since becoming a voter
in 1877 
He has voted at every election for
62 years whether town special county 
state or presidential and always
in the same voting precinct known
as the Town o f Melrose 
Some had voted longer as shown
by the contest because they were a
little older but none could say that
they had never missed an election or
had always voted in the same precinct 
In the summary the newspaper
gave Mr Polleys credit for suggesting
the contest 
The veteran voter 83 is shown
delivering his ballot to Bert Westfall 
inspector of the April 4 election 
The subject o f this sketch was born
at Baring Maine May 3 1856 and
came with his parents to Melrose in
August 1857 
He was the third son o f the late
W H Polleys pioneer lumberman on
Black river The family lived the
first 13 months in Wisconsin in the
Robert Douglas residence while Mr 
Polleys was building a house on
farm land he had bought 
The central figure in this article
began school at the age o f four years
in the first little school house in Melrose 
which was also the first school
house in Jackson county 
Finishing district school he was
fiven a commercial education to fit
im for the lumber business 
His life has ran a close and interesting
parallel to the town o f Melrose 
having been bom when the town
was a month old 
The day he was bom the school
districts and road districts were organized 
a coincidence not known until
a generation later when the public
records came into his hands in an
official way 
He has held many public positions 
having been elected town clerk in
1888 T y unanimous vote holding the
position five years then being elected
town chairman by unanimous vote
and as the tenth consecutive time was
chosen by unanimous vote again being
chairman o f the county board
four years in the meantime He was
later town chairman three years resigning
to become county highway
commissioner in 1907 holding the
position for ten years the state record
at that time 
He has done much for fraternal
organizations having been a charter
member o f the Odd Fellows lodge
organized October 1 1880 
His recent extended historical
writings are well known to our readers 
The Polleys farm is the only
one in the town o f Melrose that has
carried the same family name since
pioneer days The W H Polleys saw
mill was the first one on lower
French Island in the La Crosse area
built in 1870 the mill property covering
the lower end o f the island 
That property has recently been
purchased by the Northern States
Power Company as a site for extensive
power improvement 
A D Polleys is the only son o f
any o f the pioneer lumbermen now
residing in the Black river valley

Four sod flumes have been completed
in the Coon Creek watershed 
announces F L Robbins project engineer
for the Soil Conservation service 
They are located on farms of
Mrs Elizabeth Hofslien Chaseburg 
Hilmer Lindevig Coon Valley and
Charles Thomas Stoddard 
Sod flumes are built in gullies up
to 10 feet deep The sudden drop off
which causes the washing it flattened
about like a henhouse roof with a
gentle slope o f one foot rise in every
five to eight feet depending on the
size o f the drainage area 
Good sod is laid with the joints
staggered on the dirt base which
should be well packed Robbins explains
that the use o f commercial fertilizer
or barnyard manure makes the
sod grow better A fter tamping the
sod and filling all joints with dirt 
wire staples like a small croquet arch
are sometimes used to fasten down
the sod 
The runways vary in width from
10 to 20 feet and may bq 50 or more
feet long A narrow triangular shaped
wall o f concrete is usually placed at
the bottom to help hold the sod in
place and spread out the water 
The engineer encourages other
farmers to adopt this form o f gully
control in small areas draining up to
50 or 60 acres They are inexpensive
to construct materials are readily accessible 
and they can be easily maintained
although they need frequent
inspection and protection from grazing
until the sod has gained a strong
foothold 
Robbins suggests that all persons
interested in the construction o f these
fumes visit some o f the demonstration
flumes to study methods o f making
them or contact members o f the
Soil Conservation service

The Beaver Creek Soil Conservation
Service Project July 1 started a new
phase o f its existence for the 1939
season according to F L Higgins 
project conservationist The old office
on Kingston and Grove streets was
vacated and new office quarters will
be on the second floor o f the Smith
building at 208 East Main Street 
All field work by the government
such as gully control fencing and
terracing has been completed No new
farms are to be signed and no new
work on farms already under agreement
is contemplated said Mr Higgins 
Equipment such as tractors 
trucks and tools will be transferred to
other work areas within the state and
region 
Following a four year period o f active
field operations during which
erosion control programs have been
established on 116 farms this project
now enters a maintenance period 
During this period a staff o f technicians
will be maintained on the projects
to assist farmers in problems
pertaining to erosion control programs
and to record observations on
the effectiveness of practices that
have been established 
The Beaver Creek Soil Conservation
Area is set up as a public demonstration 
and the staff will be glad
to show the work to anyone who is
interested 
Although the Beaver Creek project
will not be signing co operative agreements
after July 1 The Caledonia
camp will continue active work in the
Bee Creek watershed in Wilmington
township Twenty four agreements
have been signed in Bee Creek Area
since July 1 1938 making a total o f
36 co operators or approximately 76
per cent o f the farms in the area 
The camp work area has now been
enlarged to include the rest o f the
farms draining into Bee Creek There
are 55 farms in this added area At
the present time the camp is working
farm programs for those who are
interested in the soil and water conservation
program Others in the Bee
Creek Area who are interested may
contact the camp office and the program
will be explained to them La

(B y Cornelius A Harper M D 
State Health Officer)
The United States Navy according
to a recent statement is manned by
the healthiest group o f individuals in
the world It is interesting to reflect
on the factors that bring about such
remarkable results in the hope that
they might be applied to a more
loosely organized group such as a
state or a city 
The entrance requirements are such
that only fine physical specimens are
accepted in the Navy Cities and
states in the American tradition are
not able to be so exacting but there
is in the various recent programs for
suppression o f diseases a distinct e ffort
to raise our requirements Wisconsin s
recently enacted premarital
examination law is a great stride in
this direction for it will insure
against babies born with the grim
handicap o f inherited syphilis 
A closely integrated group such
as our Navy personnel allows o f the
most scientific feeding imaginable 
Not so fortunate are the city and
state for our economic system has
flaws that make possible the tragedy
o f malnutrition for many and
malnutrition invites a host o f ailments
to the human body 
Supplementing this even distribution
o f nourishing food in the Navy
is a thoroughly adequate system o f
medical and surgical care available to
all exercise and adequate rest 
For generations we have produced
young men who thrive under such
discipline but most o f us are too selfindulgent
to apply the idea to ourselves 
A survey o f waist measurements
among our middle aged indicates
that a little more of the Navy
idea in our civilian life wouldn t
hurt us

The sale last Wednesday June
28th was the largest since the opening
o f the Market in September 1937 
There were 85 horses 190 cattle 
425 pigs and some farm machinery
sold in less than four hours There
were two complete farm auctions consigned
to this sale with the top cow
selling for $100 00 
There were horses cattle and pigs
from this sale that went to seven different
states This market is attracting
more out o f state buyers at every
slae because o f the large volume to
sale because o f the large volume to
a car load without having to stay a
week to drive the country for them 
If you are planning on having an
auction why not consign it to this
market where everything is sold indoors 
and plenty o f out o f state buyers
to give you top prices for your
stock instead o f having it at home
and taking the risk o f a bad day and
no crowd or sometimes a good day
when all farmers are in the fields is
just as bad for a farm auction The
selling commission is 10 per cent
which is no more than you pay to
sell your sale at home 
This sale barn is located three miles
south and two miles east o f Thorp and
these sales are held every other Wednesday
rain or shine The next sale is

Y ou ask what things the pauper owns 
He ow ns the pain in his p oor old bones 
The pathetic smile that we know him by 
And the vacant sadness o f his eye 
He owns his cap of m odest g r e y 
His coa t that he brushes and hangs away 
He owns his trousers as trousers go 
A nd his shirts and a pair o f socks o r so 
He ow ns the shoes that p rotect his feet
In his aimless journey along the street 
W here silent and wan w ith visage bowed 
He shuns the glance o f the passing crow d 
Three tim e each day in strict accord
He ow ns his place at the pauper s board 
In hours o f sunshine and o f gloom
H e owns his space o f pauper room 
W hen tw ilight falls he lays his head
On a pauper s narrow and restless bed 
The aches and the pains o f his p oor old
bones 
These are the things that the pauper owns 
Oh why do we have the pauper s hall 
And why the pauper dear God at a ll 
How sad it is to see him go
So old and frien d less so m eek and slow 
Isn t there som e place that he can stay
W here cheer and fellow ship com e his w a y 
He has w ritten the answer page b y page 
From his early youth to his grim old age 
Through n o intent o r fault o f his 
The dear old pauper is ju st what he is 
In you th s first shuffle he lost his p la c e 
In m an hood s struggle he lost the race 
W herever he traveled on life s high road 
He paused in his journey to shift his load 
And he strew ed possessions along the track
And never troubled to get them back 
He knew little o f jo y and little o f p a in 
O f w ealth o r wisdom o r good ly gain 
W hether lulled secure or tem pest hurled 
He had nothing to giv e to the w orld 
W hen adversity m et him w ith visage grim
The w orld had nothing to giv e to him 
So now we m eet him upon the way 
W ith his threadbare coa t and his cap of
grey 
But his soul is dead and his heart is bleak
As the storm that pierces his withered
cheek 
And we w atch him turn as the shadows
fall 
And take his w ay to the pauper s hall 
Then g iv e him a sm ile that is w arm and
bland
And giv e him the grip o f you r firm right

The big fire on December 27th 
which totally destroyed the Lange
drug store will be remembered for
some time The building belonged to
J R McDonald the stock to Fred
Lange 
Building operations were started
immediately and the store was again
occupied by the business on April
21st The new store was designed by
Mr Minard Walgren architect who
came here and looked over the field
to decide on the plans The finishing
was done by Ben Huntley the fixtures
made by the Milwaukee Store
Fixture company The picture gives
an idea o f the general appearance of
the attractive store The fountain
stools were not yet installed when it
was taken 
One o f the outstanding features
o f the store is a circular soda fountain
with 18 leather stools and eight
soda fountain booths which face the
store rather than each other Another
thing quite an innovation here is a
public telephone station 
The prescription department is
open entirely enclosed in glass and
in front o f it an alcove for the display
o f school supplies 
The building itself is o f fire proof
construction throughout with insulated
walls and a concrete floor The
floor covering is o f brown asphalt
pile The store front is the same as

STOCKS OF HAY GRAIN 
LARGEST IN YEARS
Madison Wis Stocks o f hay and
grain on Wisconsin farms at the beginning
o f the new crop season were
larger than in recent years according
to the estimates made by the crop reporting
service o f the Wisconsin and
United States departments o f agriculture 
Last year Wisconsin harvested the
largest hay crop in the history o f the
state Estimates at the beginning o f
the crop year show that there were
over a million tons o f hay on Wisconsin
farms These stocks o f hay
were about 35 per cent larger than
estimated for the beginning o f the
crop season last year More than
twice as much hay was carried over
this year than reported as the average
for the ten years 1928 37 
Estimates o f grain stocks show that
at the beginning o f June farmers
were holding about 4 857 000 bushels
of barley which is over a million
bushels more than the stocks on June

half million bushels o f rye as compared
with the stocks o f a year ago
was also reported On June 1
stocks o f rye on Wisconsin farms
were estimated at 1 554 000 bushels 
Earlier figures o f the Wisconsin
crop reporting service also show that
stocks o f corn oats and wheat on
Wisconsin farms were larger than a
year ago The corn crop last year was
a large one and in the spring estimates
showed that stocks o f corn on
farms in the state were over 17 million
bushels compared with about 10
million bushels in the spring o f 1938 
Stocks o f oats were estimated at
more than 29 M million bushels which
