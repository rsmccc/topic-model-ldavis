music Instrumental vocal solos and

accident at Hatfield last Wednesday
night about 6 o clock when a freight
going east had two cars derailed by
pulpwood getting under the cars just
as it got to the Hatfield canal An
empty gas car went into the canal 
another went clear across the bridge
but did not go off The pulpwood
slipped from a car under the wheel 
Usually somebody is fishing along
that bank and at times there are
many of them and had there been
the usual gang at the time the car
went over there is no question but
what someone would have been
killed As it was a girl fishing at some
distance was splashed in great shape 
The car hit the cement on one side 
was hurled 20 feet to the water where
it floated about two hours and then
sank The water is about 25 feet deep
there 
The Omaha wrecking crew came
from Altoona Friday and worked
from about 10 a m until late in the
afternoon getting the car out o f the
canal Fortunately no one was injured

a foregone conclusion that they will
play an important part in our Centennial
Homecoming They will take

of the Centennial Pageant and there
will probably be a complete Indian
Village on the Fair Grounds where

Making a reputation in the newspaper
field at the tender age of 10
years might seem to be an unheardof
proposition but little Miss Joan
Sanderson who spends a part of each
year in the Black River Falls schools 
has made the grade She went to
Washington with Mr and Mrs W E 
Sanderson and her sister Jean in
January and in a few brief weeks
she has become one of the celebrities
o f the national capital 
She and her little school friend 
Nancy Maloney aged 13 jumped
squarely into the spot-light there
when they established the Cavalier
News though they had nothing more
in mind at the outset than to give
the people of the Cavalier Apartments
a weekly summary of their
own doings 
Their novel publication quickly
 caught on and now they have a
full coverage of the many apartments
as their subscription list continues to
grow while advertisers solicit space
instead of their having to solicit the
advertising The daily press sends
re po rte r and photographers to interview
them and recently the Associated
Press sent a story to hundreds of
newspapers throughout the land including
many Wisconsin dailies Their
brief exploit into journalism has
spread their names and photographs
throughout the nation and easily
made them the best known little girls
outside the few stars in the Hollywood
firmament They had an idea
worth while are making good use of
it and the world is recognizing it 
The Cavalier Apartments one of
the largest in Washington where the
Sanderson and Maloney families reside
during congressional sessions is
owned by a New York syndicate and
among the fan mail of the young editors
is a letter from the president of
the corporation congratulating them
upon their enterprise It has made
the Cavalier more widely known than
any of its own advertising 
The Cavalier News swings right
along from week to week as advertisers
crowd for the limited space allowed
to them Incidentally the
young editors insist on re-writing all
advertising copy to make sure that
the oil companies get no better treatment
than the little delicatessen store
across the street from the apartment 
which was among the first to recognize
the News as a medium 
Misses Joan and Nancy attend
school regularly gather the news
items in their spare time and now
are seeking mimeograph facilities
commensurate with their growing
publication They are also their own
newsboys and deliver the News to its
subscribers each issue 
Busy as they are they had another
idea that of putting on a play in
which they and their little girl friends
had the parts The Cavalier manager
furnished a large room for the performance 
Little Miss Jean Sanderson 
aged 7 had one of the heavy
parts A small admission fee was
charged The room proved all too
small for the audience which filled
the adjacent corridors as well The
show will be repeated for those who
could not gain admission 
So the youthful editors their
heads unturned by their early success 
have not only their newspaper 
but also the satisfaction of learning

Herman J Gebhardt recently called
to our attention in the April 22nd
issue of the American Lumberman
references to the old logging days
on Black and nearby rivers Published
under the title News and Views
of 50 Years Ago it will be found of
particular interest just now when all
that is old is of interest in that we
are celebrating our centennial in the
Black river valley 
 There is a jam of several miles
below Black River Falls which they
have been trying to break for several
days I t is hoped to get it broken
before another rise comes and piles
more logs up 
 White pine is king It is still supreme
in the northern States but its
power has been weakened by the forays
o f other woods especially yellow
pine The war between the
northern and southern rivals is to be
hereafter waged with increasing zeal
on the part o f the combatants I t is
to be another war between the North
and South though the fight will be
along the peaceful lines o f commerce 
But though the contest must go on 
there is no danger that the northern
force will be utterly defeated until
the last forest giant stall have been
laid low 
 The announcement that Beef
Slough the bayou near the mouth o f
the Chippewa into which logs have
been run and thence rafted down the
Mississippi would be abandoned has
caused more of a stir than any similar
event in lumber circles for years 
Beef Slough it is certain has spent
thousands in trying to keep the entrance
o f the slough open and to establish
improvements which would
run the logs into the slough The bar
at the entrance has proved an un
superable obstacle

 In F u tu re
According to Learson and Allen 
Congress will adjourn June 15 but
what these worthies do not know is
that one of Washington s leading1
newspapers will also be discontinuedat
that same time!
As goes Congress so go the editors
of this paper the Cavalier News
edited and distributed by two young
ladies whose families are down with
Congress 
Joan Sanderson 10 and Nancy
Maloney 12 started this paper for
the residents of the Cavalier Apartments
on February 18 of this year 
These two up-and-coming newspaper
women started their paper with but
25 subscribers but since then the
number has mounted to 125 
When interviewed as to why they
had started such an undertaking 
Nancy answered We were jus 
walking through the halls one day
trying to think of something to do
that would be fun Then it suddenly
came to us Why not start a paper
of our very own Gee we thought 
that would be loads o f fun so wi
just did it ! 
Their first paper was made and
written in their own hand the next
one was hectographed and the present
one is being mimeographed In the
beginning the expenses didn t seem to
meet with the money on hand but
since then they have been making
more than enough A t the present
time they have $40 to their credit
through the newspaper 
Among their most prized possessions
is a letter received from the
Benjamin Franklin Amateur Journalism
Society which asked them to forward
a copy o f the newspaper to
them as they thought very much of
it 
In the near future Nancy and Joan
intend to sponsor a play They will
find the talent for it within the Cav
alier The expenses will be paid by
the paper

Last Tuesday evening some pulp
wood on a Green Bay Western
freight train broke loose from its
holdings and fell down on the track
on a swift moving freight train going
east 
The timber ditched two cars o ff
the track and they were dragged from
the crossing just east o f the depot to
the canal bridge when the train
line broke and a large oil tank went
into the canal doing some damage
to the bridge I t is reported that a
woman fisherman near by was nearly
drowned when the splash from the
huge tank hit the water 
A t first the tank floated around 
but as it gradually filled with water
it sank to the bottom north of the
bridge and only the top end of the
tanker was out o f water 
The track which was torn up was
rapidly repaired and trains went on
as usual The damage to the bridge
up to a late hour has not been fixed
as yet 
Friday the big wrecker o f the
Omaha system with all it crew went
over and worked several hours to get
the tank car out and loaded on an
empty coal car and taken to Green
Bay It looked to be a total wreck 
It sure cost the company a b it of
money

On January 1 1939 there were
one-half million more dairy cows than
for a year earlier say economists at
the Wisconsin College of Agriculture 
Although there were one-fourth million
fewer beef cows the prospects
are fo r increased numbers of both
dairy and beef cattle during the next
few years 
Foresters point out that fire in a
farm woodlot may not only damage
some of the larger trees so that their
value is reduced when they are eventually
sold for timber but many times
the fire does its greatest damage to
the young seedlings which need to
grow in order to keep a new stand

Feeling tired and cross and blue 
And the manifold duties that await
you
Are anything but few 
When the clothes are at last out adrying 
And a sudden shower comes down 
When the children are fretful and

And you silence them with a frown 
When the house is upset and untidy 
And the cupboard is bare I ll say 
And company arrives at that moment

Never was there a brighter day
than the one that greeted the people
on Tuesday for the Memorial Day
services The sun shone from a clear
sky in the very early morning and
continued to shine all day 
The program was carried out as
outlined last week The school children
headed by the war veterans and
the school band marched from the
school campus to the cemetery A t
the monument the band played America 
Then the members o f the Relief
Corps gave their burial service Then
Rev Fahlgren gave a fine patriotic
address This was followed by a salute
to the soldier dead by the firing
squad and then the children decorated
the graves of the soldiers with flowers 
I t was a very impressive ceremony
throughout and it was the opinion of
all that this Memorial day ceremony
be continued and not allowed to go
by default again To which we all say
 Amen

The recent submarine disaster kept
us all literally glued to the radio this
week Several years ago a submarine
anchored in the Willamette river in
Portland Oregon and was opened to
the public for inspection I took advantage
of the opportunity and explored
it from end to end going down
inside and seeing the control room
and having all the equipment and instruments
explained It didn t seem
very large it was long and very narrow 
and gave one a feeling of stuffiness
and a longing to get up the
ladder and outside in the air again 
Most interesting of all was the periscope 
that baffling instrument which
when looked into showed street cars
crossing the bridge above the river 
some two blocks away I imagine the
periscope works something like a camera
does for everything appeared
black and white as in a photograph 
It was interesting to visit but not the
sort of ship I d choose for a pleasure
cruise and I found myself gulping
the sweet fresh air when I was back
on solid earth once more The feelings
of those men trapped so long in
the Squalus and then almost miraculously
saved by the first rescue of
its kind in history can only be imagined 
Surely they must be submarineshy
for the rest of their lives 
Miss La Von Hauge o f Black
River Falls is one of those lucky people
who actually win prizes in contests 
Her s was a five-pound package
of cheese and she won it by sending
the best recipe using cheese She
kindly passed on her prize recipe to
us and here it is 
G lorified Cheese
1 wiener cut open full length
1 slice cheese same size as weiner
1 strip bacon
Put cheese in weiner wrap bacon
around it and roast over a camp fire 
It makes a very good picnic lunch
meat or can be used as the meat
course at dinner 
When scouring try using a large
cork instead of a cloth Cork cleans
easily and saves the dish-cloth 
I f your shoe gets scuffed especially
the covered heel flatten the scuffed
piece with liquid nail polish 
When dry shine the shoe and the
scuffed area will not show 
Now for a bit of verse from Mrs 
A C Teeter of Swan River Minnesota 
Mrs Teeter gets my vote for
writing the cheeriest letters on record 
and I m sure you will all appreciate

There are 69 billion dollars in the
savings accounts of the people It
represents more than twice the
amount of present farm values including
real estate and personal property 
and five times the estimated
value of the railways I t is so large
an amount that about the only comprehendable
comparison is that it is
nearly double the amount o f the national
debt and represents about h a lf
the entire governmental and private
debt total On a per capita basis it is
$560 per person 
This huge total includes not only
savings accounts in banks and trust
companies but also life insurance 
building and loan associations etc 
Two-thirds the total represents the
thrift of the people of only six states 
and one-half thereof those of New
York alone There are several cities
outside the metropolis in that state
which have savings larger than those
o f many of the rather populous states 
There are billions of the savings
funds idle at present along with the
excess reserves o f the commercial
banks Sound investments are many 
but who knows what is a sound investment
in a world so topsy-turvey
that it continues to spend more money
fo r war preparedness than for
food products fo r its people One may
wonder what would be the status o f
our national savings if all the war
making statesmen had access io
any considerable portion of them 
which fortunately they have not 
There are some equally ruthless
and greedy however and the Security
bureaus of nation and state are
having a busy time of it trying to
stop their raids upon thrifty Gigantic
conspiracies are being unearthed
whereby the unscrupulous slickers in
finance are separating the savings
from the savers Almost daily come
published statements as to apprehension
of some such rascals who thrive
by dishonesty In one instance noted 
over ten million dollars were gathered
in by swindlers in a single scheme 
They not only defrauded smaller clients
with only a few hundred of idle
money but reached the wealthier 
those who have better facilities for
learning about the offered securities 
but who fail to make use o f
them Some of such investors lost
from $5 000 to $100 000 The lure of
larger returns and bigger dividends 
along with a possibility o f profitable
speculation the common bait of
swindlers seems to affect folks of
large means as well as those of more
limited resources The result is always
a loss to those who work and save 
no matter what the size of their piles 
The president s address to the retailers
has emphasized the economy
issue all over again The morning following
its delivery there came a widespread
demand for information as to
just how much this congress has appropriated 
this session and how
much more must be appropriated for
essentials without frills Odd as it
may seem with all the machinery and
forces of both house and senate no
accurate statement is forth-coming 
Nor can the Treasury lend any aid
in answering the inquiry Some information
can be attained by adding the
totals of the numerous appropriation
bills but even that would be far
from the approximate The budgetmakers
may have a better knowledge
but even they have not all the
figures 
Off-hand it is known to all that
interest on the national debt will total
a billion plus Army and Navy will
have 1M billions with the amount
growing almost daily Veteran s pensions
and facilities will aggregate another
billion Expenses of the regular
government establishments including
salaries of nearly a million employees 
and routine expenditures for everything
from cars for high officials to
the cost of entertaining kings presidents
and ambassadors will amount
to 1 *2 billions more These few measures
will aggregate five billions The
more important thing with congress is
 Where do we go from here

Word was received in Melrose on
Friday of the death of May 17 1939
at Hardy Saskatchewan Canada of
Mrs Ju lia Avery widow of the late
A rthur Avery who preceded her in
death by a few years She was bom
in the town of Melrose a daughter of
Ed Miller now of Bangor The family
moved to Canada only a few years
ago She is survived by one daughter 
Mrs Lola Ristow who lived with
her in Canada 
The application of economy as is 
continues to be applied to smaller
items of expense while the Army and
Navy and other accounts constantly
mount The senate added $381 000 -
000 to the Agricultural Department
Bill bringing the total to $1 216 528 
572 That total is about $60 000 more
than that o f the current year Some
o f the House leaders long on the
A rmy and Navy increases and numerous
other additions to the budget including
more funds for a twenty-million-
dollar highway through the moun
tains of Virginia fairly howled over
the blow to economy The increases
include $113 000 000 for the purchase
o f dairy products and other commod
ities to relieve congested markets with
declining prices Unless this stabilization
is authorized a further decline in
already ruinously low prices for butter
and cheese is anticipated costing
the dairy farmers several times the
amount of the stabilization appropriation
in losses Still these particular
advocates o f economy would have the
savings start on the famis and end
there 
Not all the agricultural appropriations
will go to the farmers Included
therein are all other funds for department
expenses some very remotely
affecting the farmers and
against which economy is not invoked 
Included among many such
items are about $5 000 000 for the
weather bureau an equal amount for
packing house inspectors $19 millions
for the Forestry bureau $187 000 -
000 for federal road aid and $14 millions
more for roads in national parks 
Then comes another $48 millions for
bounties to the sugar industries in order
to permit the importation o f more
sugar from Cuba Enforcement of the
food and drug act and the Alaska
game law protection fo r migratory
birds and a dozen more like $20 millions
for forestry make a substantial
part o f the total sum A cut was made
in the funds for the Bureau of the

Marian Hulett
A large and appreciative 3 ience
listened to Prof William Laux of the
La Crosse State Teachers College 
give an address to the graduating
class of 1939 
The most salient points that Prof 
Laux drove home to our graduates
was that there is a place for them in
this fast moving age of ours So long
as there are dreaded diseases such as
cancer infantile paralysis etc which
the medical world has been unable to
conquer there are not too many doctors 
nurses etc So long as farmers
see their fertile land blown away by
dust storms there are not too many
engineers This information was grate
fully received by the graduates since
the opinion that most people share is

A slight splurge of comical work
afield which spotted the Madison
Wrend s a passel of three runs all
of which were besmirched with the
unearned taint only served to rouse
the ire o f Merchant brethem to the
extent deluging the premises with a
h alf dozen assorted but lusty basenoks
good for an equal number of
counters A ll of this happened in the
fifth scene of the Memorial day game
at the F a ir grounds Another slightly
soiled count was gathered by the Capital
fellers in the eighth two very
scratchy infield hits and a passed ball
being the ingredients involved 
Ernie the fireball mite hurled
shut-out ball counting seventeen
strikeouts and letting the foe down
with six hits three o f which were infield
scratches Except in the fifth
when the goofy fielding came to pass
the little geezer had the downstaters
looking as silly as we did the time we
were demonstrating a graceful swan
dive to a bevy of defrosters and discovered 
after we had gracefully
leaped o ff the spring board that the
swim tank was empty which is to say
the visitors weren t at all the city
slickers they pretended to be 
The first hint of excitement came
in the fifth when Ponty lined a smash
to the fence in left for a triple It
began to look as though the gent
would stay at third as Ernie whiffed
Bauhs Fisk hit a slow roller at Ernie
who couldn t get his mitts solidly on
the pill until Ponty crossed home 
Rudy shot the pill to first to get Fish
by five steps but a queer decision
robbed the Merchants of the putout 
A wide peg from short gave Dorn a
life and sent Fisk to second Rudo ph
used three strikes to embalm Hilgers
for what should have been at least
the third out but turned out to be
only the second Dickert then looped
a hit just out of Hauser s reach A rnold
pegged the ball in but nobody
paid any attention to it until Fisk and
Dorn registered runs number 2 and
3 Schwab ended the flurry with a fly
to Kleven 
The enemy had started to gloat over
their good fortune but had a
chance to enjoy themselves only until
Hauser had been retired Mr Midfeldt
then lined a single over third A
screaming line double to the fence in
left by Arnold sent the third sacker
home Randles lined a smash to center 
Arnold taking third A single to
the same terrain exploded o ff Kleven s
bat Arnold counting 
The scene was thus set for some
heroics at the bat and an old pal of
Babe R uth s viz Mr Teeples smote
the pill on the nose It bounded off
the fence in left center and Ward
and Hank loped home Art Rudolph
collected an infield single for himself
and went to second as Pfholer
let the ball get away Teeples scoring 
Hoard was retired via 2nd but
E Rudolph survived on a miscue at
second A rthur cashing at the plate
fo r the sixth run That was the ball
game the last feeble gesture by the
Madisonians being only a consolatory
run And thus the third triumph in
three tries was hung up by the Merchants
