SH ALL W E H AV E
STUDENT G O V ERN M EN T 
For several years the subject o f
government has been a favorite topic
o f discussion among groups in the
Black River Falls High school However 
in spite o f all these discussions
little action has ever been taken toward
its establishment 
Many o f the student body and faculty
feel that now is the time for
action Why keep continually talking
about a subject and do nothing towards
its realization Let s get some
reactions pro and con the idea If
the students here really want student
government its a ten to one chance
that they ll get it 
Is here any reason why our high
school could not have student government 
It certainly is large enough
and well organized In short we have
all the advantages needed 
Most o f the larger high schools and
all colleges have student government 
Its organization is rather simple 
There would be a student council 
composed o f representatives o f all
four classes in high school The way
o f choosing these representatives
would be designated at a later time 
A president or chairman would be in
charge The council would help administer
and make laws for the
school Perhaps they would draw up
a school constitution However this
doesn t mean there would be no supervisor
by the faculty A faculty
advisor would be on the council and
the principal would act as a president 
with full veto power He must
approve all measures passed 
In a democratic community every
one has a share in government The
school is our community and trains its
students to be better citizens 
Shouldn t the students then have a
share in the government o f their
 community One will make a better
citizen if he has had previous
training in school government By
student government additional powers
would be given to the students additional
advantages could be secured
and every one would feel as if he had
a part in running his school 
The question is now turned over to
you students Do you want student
government 
Let s not have this issue fade quietly
away as do most editorials Talk
about it among your friends and
classes discuss it with your class advisor 
Above all get busy do something
and let s see results 
O RCH E STRA PLAN S TO M AH TRIP
If you see a lot o f happy faces as
you walk down the hall ask the wearer
if he s in the orchestra The answer
will most likely be Yes The
members are all a flutter for they are
planning an exchange concert with
Tomah orchestra 
Because o f the basketball game
schedule the concert will probably be
held in the afternoon on a Thursday
in December All o f our students have
agreed to make up their work ahead
o f time so they can go to Tomah The
orchestra has been promised a party
again this year and it will by all
means be a grand and glorious one
for the new gym in Tomah has been
finished and is now in use

WISCONSIN UNION T H EA TRE
Drama! Recreation! Music! And
Sports Activities! A rt! And that is
what the new Wisconsin Union Theatre 
situated in Madison and termed
 The most complete plant in the United
States was publicly opened for 
on Monday October 9 
Construction began in the fall o f
1937 and was financed through a
university regent approved loan to be
paid out o f revenues o f the building 
and by alumni and student gifts plus
a $266 000 PWA grant The total
cost o f the theatre was $966 000 
The theatre was dedicated to its
purpose o f furthering and promoting
artistic life in the University 
Michael Hare a New York architect 
was the designer and in my opinion 
he did an excellent job o f it You
see there is a seating capacity of
1300 and the seats are even oversized
for patrons who want more
room (Imagine that!)
The theatre consists o f 105 rooms 
meeting rooms a music room craft
workshops 2 theatres dark rooms for
camera enthusiastics bowling alleys 
and outdoor sports headquarters 
Double duty is the rule in the
rooms o f the new wing The theatres
are designed to house lectures demonstrations 
meeting and movies 
The theatre lounge may be converted
into a rehearsal room sound proofed
with the close o f accordian type
doors 
The theatre also features indirect
lighting air conditioning and elevated
fore stage a specially designed
switchboard a glass incased audition
section in the rear o f the theatre 
auditorium and even a partitioning
curtain by which the theatre can be
expanded or reduced in size The
stage is 35 feet deep and 78 feet
wide 
In the basement there are bowling
alleys floated on cork so that bowling
enthusiastics may indulge in their favorite
sport even while a play is going
on upstairs 
I ve given you a brief description
o f the Wisconsin Union Theatre the
most complete plant in the United
States Just think! We have that in
our own Wisconsin! Who could ask
for anything more

B R FALLS VS MONDOVI
B R Falls beat Mondovi High
school in a hard fought battle by a
score o f 18 to 13 for the last home
game o f the season A good crowd
turned out to see Carisch do all the
scoring for B R 
The first quarter opened with B R 
kicking off to Mondovi s 25 yd line
from where Mondovi tries several
plays and punts B R immediately
starts on a successful march to the
goal It was highlighted by several
line smashes by Upton that sent Mondovi
players flying Then a short
pass to Horswill and a long pass from
Horswill to Carisch suffice to put the
ball over the line 
In the second quarter a spectacular
run is made by Carisch Mondovi 
after losing 8 yds on a fumble sent
a beautiful punt soaring which descends
on B R s 20 yd line where it
is caught by Carish who runs 80 yds 
for a touchdown 
During the remainder o f the quarter
several passes are completed One
by B R is for 25 yds and the other
two for Mondovi total 58 yds and
leave Mondovi on B R s 14 yd 
marker when the whistle blows for
the half 
The second half opens with a Mondovi
punt being blocked which is recovered
by a B R player on Mondovi s
20 yd line A run by Carisch 
two by Horswill and the ball is inside
the 10 yd stripe from where Carisch
again takes it over for the third touch
down making the score 18 0 Here
Mondovi gets their second wind and
after intercepting a pass they complete
another long one and the ball is
on B R s 22 yd line when the quarter
ends In the last quarter another
pass puts the pigskin on the 6 yd 
line where a Mondovi team full of
new pep put it over the line The
extra point is scored and the score
is 18 7 An exchange o f punts and
a long run by Horswill and another
by Carisch start to look like a touchdown 
when pass is intercepted and a
touchdown march is started by Mondovi
and is completed An irate B R 
team starts with the kick off and
eager for revenge are advancing toward
the goal with smash after
smash into Mondovi s line when the
whistle ends the game

EDI 1 O RIAL
A fter the World War the leadership
o f the world was transferred
from Great Britian to the United
States The United States was not
ready for such a far reaching responsibility
to be assumed immediately 
yet she built herself up intellectually
and culturally in a very short
time Now she has leadership in
many fields most notably in politics 
culture and science 
The Americans have either invented 
promoted or most extensively
used every modern invention Take 
for instance the telephone automobile 
the steamship the airplane and
the locomotive all o f which were invented
and used most extensively by
Americans The radio is the work
o f several inventions o f which many
o f the newest were made by Americans 
The Diesel motor theory and
other inventions and contrivances invented
in Europe were used most extensively
and developed mostly in
America Practically all developments
or improvements are and were
made by Americans Television is
being studied and worked upon mostly
in America as well as rocket ships 
New electrical appliances are being
developed daily and improved all the
time We are now in the new inventive
era 
During the World War millions of
youth and young men were killed
who would be in their prime now 
and they would no doubt some o f
them have been great politicians 
scientists leaders militarists musicians 
artists and so on in any number
o f fields Yet these European
youth were killed or maimed and it
was left to the American youth to
shoulder the burden The number
o f American youth killed in the war
was comparatively few in ratio to
the number o f foreigners The
Americans have done nobly 
Since we have attained this world
leadership we have a natural tendency
to keep it and we will if all
goes as it has and as it is at present 
Still we can keep this leadership if
the world were peaceful for we are
capable o f it It would only be harder
if all the countries were at peace 
It would be better too for competition
breeds results good ones 
In sumation we the Americans 
are the future leaders o f the world
and we should take advantage o f this
opportunity and make the best o f it 
We should prepare to lead the world
onward

MERLIN HULL S LETTER
As the debate on the Neutrality
bill continues in the Senate with the
possibility o f a vote by November
1st or even earlier plans o f the administration
for the regular session
in January continue to be broached in
the press and otherwise Often it is
possible to guess what may be forthcoming
in such plans by the press
releases and other statements o f the
leaders suggesting the necessity of
one policy or another Seldom is any
big legislation brought to Congress
for enactment without some preliminaries
which serve to prepare the
public for the move Often the need
is played up before the remedy is
even formulated 
At present both press and radio
are dwelling upon the defenseless
situation o f our country in case several
European nations o f predatory
purposes shall conclude at some time
in the future to cross the Atlantic
with the determination o f despoiling
our country o f its riches and again
making it a subservient colony o f international
conspirators Europe now
has and always has had plenty o f
troubles o f its own without crossing
the seas with millions o f men to conquer
us which would be an attempt
as foolish as it is impossible But it
is claimed that we must have a couple
o f navies to make sure it may not be
made Hence the need o f naval expenditures
o f previously unheard of
preparations now is being mentioned
as our only safe guard 
It is explained by the promoters
of the expansion that when Japan
completes the conquest o f China with
the aid o f money and munitions supplied
by our country it will be in
position to build a bigger navy which
might endanger our Pacific coast 
therefore our present navy which 
with appropriations now available 
will be the biggest in the world by
1946 will be needed on the Pacific
to prevent Japanese aggression Then
another navy even larger will be
necessary on the Atlantic 
The cost o f a second navy is estimated
at about three billions o f dollars 
and the expense o f providing the shipyards
to build it the docks and storage
space for its equipment and supplies 
and other items will aggregate
another billion making four billions
in all It is said that only by such an
expenditure can our land be made
safe from invasion if and hen the
rest o f the world makes ready to
come our way to seek our hoard of
gold in the Kentucky hills and as
much more o f our wealth as they may
desire 
Great as would be the cost o f a
navy more than twice the size o f our
present fleet the up keep would be
even greater and at the end o f ten
years there would be as much need
for replacement as there now is for
construction The present cost o f our
sea defenses is greater than that o f
the salaries o f the 923 000 employees
now on the civil lists The plan for
this expansion o f armament does not
include suggestions as to what form
o f taxes will be needed to pay the
expense nor how they could be paid 
It is argued that such a spending program
would aid business but there
will be something happen when business
gets over that kind o f a shotin 
the arm treatment 
The Department o f State realizes
that it has aroused political storm in
furthering its proposed trade agreement
with Argentine Hitherto it has
been able to get by with rather limited
opposition from senators and
congressmen at the preliminary hearings
and apparently has paid little
attention to such protests as have
been made by others The hearings
on other treaties such as that with
Canada brought only a few farm organizations
to voice objections to the
program But at the hearings on the
Argentine treaty held last week more
than a dozen senators and fifty congressmen
were there with fight talk 
and the representatives o f many farm
organizations and in most instances
they were loud in their protests
against selling our home markets to
foreign farmers to benefit relatively
few o f the great industries which are
profiting more largely by expansion
o f foreign trade 
At former hearings the objections
come principally from Republicans
and Progressives from northern
states where farmers have suffered
heavier losses from the reduction o f
tariff rates which exposed them to
greater foreign competition At the
recent hearing there were even more
Democratic members than others and
some o f them said bluntly that even
though they had voted for the law 
they realized the unfair treatment
agriculture had received under it and
would favor its repeal which has
not added to the pleasures o f the
State department Were the Argentine
treaty to come before Congress
for approval it would not weather
the storm but unforunately Congress
in 1933 voted away its say in such
matters 
Prominent among the farm organizations
which are fighting against the
treaty are those o f the turkey growers 
who have greatly expanded that
industry in recent years In Virginia
alone the sales amount to over
$5 000 000 annually This year there
will be over 32 000 000 turkeys prepared
for markets or 22 per cent
more than last year In Argentine
turkeys are raised at a cost o f less
than 10 cents per pound and can be
marketed in our eastern sea board
cities at less than 15 cents It is one
illustration o f what would be the effect
o f Argentine competition if the
treaty is effected One New York
City attorney appearing for an exporting
agency answered that the
treaty would serve to lower the price
of linseed oil so that farmers could
buy their paints cheaper But it
would take a lot o f 10 cent turkeys to
buy paint for a farm house or barn 
MERLIN HULL
Ed J Seymour o f California 
spent a couple o f days in town during
the end o f the week He had not been
here for 20 years and it was 43
years since he first shook the dirt of
Black River Falls from his feet and
began picking up other dirt And has
he picked! We could have a long
story on how our home town boy
made good Suffice it to say he has
won by his own efforts two or three
fortunes and when fortune turned her
face the other way he never faltered
in his stride but proceeded to forge
to the top again Right now he owns
and operates Big Sur Lodge a beau
tiful lodge with 80 cabins in connection
with it located on the famous
Carmel and San Simeon highway in

giving them that treat again
