FORTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN, THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 1939 NUMBER 46
Farm Foreclosures
The proposed farm mortgage law
by Republican Assemblyman Walter
Cook, Clark County, may never receive
legislative action. Tho bill introduced
late in the session is scheduled far another
hearing and from all reports it
appears that the legislators are ready
to call it “quits” and go home.
Cook’s mortgage proposal is termed
the most moratorium policy ever suggested
in Wisconsin and would change
nearly all of Wisconsin’s present moratorium
law. The author of the bill at
its first hearing last week claimed that
his bill is not aimed at private mortgage
lenders but at the federal land
bank, “ the policies of which are inhumane,
unsound, and unfair.”
The present state law provides for
mediation and compromise and extension
of foreclosure, scaling down the
interest and principle payments
through the discretion of the courts.
Cook’s bill would prevent any court
from allowing a foreclosure under the
following conditions:
1. I f the owner or members of his
fam ily reside upon or operate the
farm.
2. I f the owner pays current taxes
when they become due and payable.
3. I f the owner keeps up his insurance
as provided in the mortgage contract.
4. I f the owner pays the mortgagee
interest at the rate of 2 per cent per
annum on a monthly basis.
The Clark County assomblvn'nn
maintained at the hearing that his bill
was introduced with Governor Heil’s
support. He quoted Heil as saying
that the “ legislature should pass a law
to stop every foreclosure in Wisconsin.”
Opponents of the measure and some
of the assembly agriculture committee
doubt, if a Wisconsin law would
have any effect on the foreclosures
executed by the federal land bank. It
is their claim that in cases of conflict
federal laws would take precedence
over state statutes. Others again
offer the suggestion that perhaps ♦he
enactment of a state law would induce
congress to change the policies of the
federal land bank. The chief critici«m
of the federal land bank law was thati
it compels foreclosures with resulting,
fairs at sacrifice prices and bars thej
foreclosed farmer from bidding atj
the sale.
Senator Harry Bolens of Port Washington
appeared at the hearing urging |
consideration for the farmer. He
stated that he did not want farmers to
lose their property now when price* j
are rising because of the war. Ho[
said. “We are going to feed the world
and this poor devil has the right to
take advantage of it after long years
of struggle.”
Welfare Board Named
The policy making advisory board
for the newly created, important state
welfare department has been named by
Governor Heil and submitted to the
senate for confirmjftion.
The new state administrative division
will take over all the work of the
present board o f control, the pension
department, the welfare department of
mental hygiene and corrections. Five

welfare, mental hygiene, corrections,
and administration and research.
First job of the new board will he to

$7,500 annually. He in turn will name
heads of the five divisions of the department.

Capitol Notes
To aid in the enforcement of the 2
cent per package cigarette tax, the assembly
has passed a bill which prohibits
bringing in from out of the
state more than 1 carton of untaxed
cigarettes or more than 50 untaxed
cigarette tubes. The bill also permits
state treasurer employees, who must
enforce the law, to enter buildings or
search suitcases, trunks, trucks or
automobiles without search warrants.
Warrants must be had, however, to
search private dwellings or sealed railroad
cars.
A joint resolution has been introduced
in the senate which asks that
the state constitution be amended to
provide for the setting up of a conservation
commission under four commissioners.

The onen house at the public school
last night was a great success. H undreds
of people came to see the teachers
and children at work, and the new
class rooms and gymnasium. All
were impressed with the fine condition
of everything in and about the
buildings and how tho teachers conducted
their classes. It was one of
the finest advertisements of tho splendid
school plant that Wittenberg has
and of the fine faculty in charge.
Many compliments were hoard about
the new gymnasium and the new
class rooms in the addition recently
completed, which are modern in every
respect, large and well lighted.
It is hoped this will be an annual
event so as to give the parents the
opportunity to visit the school early
in the year.

Study Rehabilitation Programs
The joint assembly-senate legislative
committee appointed to study the)
rehabilitation problems of Wisconsin’s
cut-over areas, referred to as “ tho
problem area,” will not hear or consider
any new proposals until a thorough
examination is made of tho programs
and projects already in
progress, according to Senator A. B.
Coller, Necedah, chairman of the committee.
To do that he will ask the committee
to travel extensively throughout the
northern, western and central cut-over
areas of Wisconsin to look into such
projects as federal resettlements,
federal and state forest developments,
state forest crop areas, state recreational
projects, and state and^ federal
game refuges. Senator Coller explains
that all of the above program' were
designed to solve the economic plight
of the state’s “problem area.”
Teacher’s Tenure Referendum
Wisconsin’s voters will in 1940 decide
whether or not the teacher’s
tenure law passed by tho 1937 legislature
shall be repealed.
Several attempts to repeal the law
in the present session were blocked
by Progressives, but they failed to
stop nassage of a joint resolution in
both houses which will ask the voter
next year what he wants done about
the law.
Th'* law as it now stands provides
that a teacher, after serving a several
year probationary period, cannot be
discharged except for misbehavior or
inefficiency, and that he can demand a
public hearing if he is discharged.
Dr. Weswig to Speak Here
An opportunity has come foi the i
friends and members of the First
Lutheran church to hear Dr. Carl M.
Weswig. well known professor of
'’hurch history of Luther Theolog-;
;cal seminary in St. Paul. He is go-'
ing to speak in Immanuel congregation

“ F o llo w in g Congress**
Do you ever wonder what goes on in
the two halls of Congress in Washington
? Do you wonder what representatives
and senators are doing and saying
upon important matters?
O f course, the Congressional Record
gives a daily report of these transac-!
tions but very few of us have the time
or the desire to road all of this material
in order to keep abreast with what
is going on.
For busy homemakers, unable to
spend time in reading this offical
record, the staff of the state radio
stations, WHA and WLBL, have
planned a weekly summary which is
calk'd “Following Congress.” In it,
Mrs. Jennie M. Turner of the State
Board of Vocational Education, and a
corps of workers dramatize scenes in
Congress. They give pro and con
arguments by leaders in many of the
controversies. In this way, listeners
become acquainted with the attitudes
of different groups, and learn to recognize
the sectional partisanships, prejudices,
convictions, and statesman-
I ship which combine to bring about a
better understanding of what’s going
l on in Washington.
This is the third consecutive year in
which Mrs. Turner has arranged these
programs. Gerald A. Bartell, WHA
I director, and a cast of trained actors
present the productions. They are
given each Tuesday afternoon, September
to May, at 3 p. m.

improvements are noticeable on the
premises.
Larry Harry’s tavern a few miles
north of town is now presenting a

of tho now front is apple green and
the trimming is in black. The new
front was put in by Mr. Harry’s

school and employees buildings, laundry,
warehouse, pumphouse, icehouse,
and barracks. This last summer and
autumn he has reshingled and painted
the bungalow. In part of his work he
has been assisted by his son.
Romance and Reality
When future historians come to
study this present war, I think they
will be puzzled by one fact, namely,
that it is the Germans who boast and
threaten, while it is the British who
speak softly and cry for peace.
This is strange, because the Germans
are, by nature, a romantic people.
happiest when tranquil; while the
British are perhaps the most pugnacious
breed of man that has ever
roamed this planet.
Tho British are natural fighting
men. a warrior race if ever there was
one; and their allies, the French, are
so fa r from being pacifists that they
have gfffcn us practically the wrhole
vocabulary of militarism. Yet it Is
the German— singer, philosopher and
family man—who struts in armor and
hymns the glory of war.
I wonder if in all its fantastic history
the world has ever been quite so
topsy-turvy as it is now.— Howard

•re the astute international observers
who have called Russia's Josef
Stalin the shrewdest diplomat of Europe,
shrewder even than G e rm any's
Adolf Hitler who begged and
won Russia’s friendship a few weeks
ago. Like a remote control operator
who needs only to punch buttons.
Dictator Stalin sat in his Kremlin
palace and manipulated diplomatic
machinery that responded like onetwo-
three clockwork in a sequence
of events that sped westward from
Tokyo to Paris and London, leaving
the harried allies of Europe’s war
in miserable shape:
Truce. For five years stubborn

Eyes turned west.
ough welding of world totalitarianism.
Germany, already allied with j
Ja pa n, intervened to start conversa- I
tions between Soviet Premier Viacheslav
Molotov and Ja pa n's am- \
bassador to Moscow, Shigenori Togo.
Result: A Jap-Soviet truce, wel- |
corned in Tokyo because it m eant j
Nippon could not only push her conquest
of China but also oust pestif- |
erous French and British interests
from the Orient.
Conquest. Thus freed, Russia
turned westward. German troops
already occupied half of Poland, I
whose defense was collapsing rapidly.
While Dictator Stalin ran the
show from behind scenes, Premier
Molotov sent his troops, tanks and
planes wheeling across the frontier I
to “ take under their protection”
about 11,000,000 Ukrainians and '
White Russians in eastern and
southern Poland. Thus relieved (by
pre-arrangement) from conquering !
the rest of that nation, Germany 1
was in turn freed to turn westward. !
Result. Some observers believed
76 German divisions used against
Poland were rushed to the western
front, where silence still masked i
hostilities in the Saar basin. But
both France and Britain knew their
job was becoming more formidable
hourly as the Nazi juggernaut began
unleashing its full strength.
Questions, Forecasts
Unnoticed in this ghastly and
growing conflict were the fa tf and
fortunes of men-at-arms. Britain
had lost 2 2 ships including the veteran
airplane carrier. Courageous.
Three hundred thousand men fought
in the Saar, with thousands more on
the way. Gdynia fell. Brest-Litovsk
and Lwow were shambles. Warsaw,
in even worse shape, negotiated her
surrender. Paris heard the Russians
were invading Lithuania, also that
the Polish war had cost Germany
100,000 killed and wounded. (One
dead was a grandson of the ex-Kaiser.)
France's mine layer, Pluton,
exploded in Morocco.
But men were merely pawns in
the game of war. While they died, i
their leaders fretted over a future
which m ay make today's holocaust 1
mild by comparison. Nations with
far-flung territories (France and
Britain) suffer most when their enemies
(Japan, Russia, Germany and
Italy) are also far flung. While the
; harried allies had their hands full
i keeping mighty Germany at bay behind
her invulnerable West wall,
these things might happen:
Japan. Under German coaxing,
| Dictator Stalin might withdraw his
support of China’s long-suffering
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, thus
; paving the way for immediate completion
of Ja p a n ’s war. Meanwhile
the maze of European concessions
and settlements in China could be
wiped out because western nations
are too busy at home to complain.
Russia. With 600,000 men concentrated
on the Afghanistan border,
the Soviet could use this nation as a
jum ping off place in her campaign
to establish rule over India. Meanwhile
the K rem lin’s threat is luring
Turkey away from her alliance
with B ritain and France, thus closing
the Black sea outlet which has
been R u m a n ia ’s sole hope of independence.
Germany. Between them the
Reich and Soviet must divide Poland.
If Germany takes only her
pre-World war territory (See Map)
and Russia takes only the land Poland
took by force in 1919-20. a buffer
state would still remain between
the two powers— provided a settlement
can be reached in southeastern
Poland, whose rich Galician
; lands are coveted by both Berlin
and Moscow.
Italy. Shattered was the popular
; belief that Italy would not only stay
neutral, but might even come to the
| allies’ side. Observers still expected
Benito Mussolini to promulgate
a peace conference any day, but
they also knew he had an ulterior
motive. Italy wants the French-
Italian port of Djibouti, entrance to
Italian Ethiopia, made a free port;
she wants control of the Djibouti-
Addis Ababa railroad; she wants a

Next Case
When Dr. Jam es Monroe Smith
fled his Louisiana State university
for a Canadian haven last summer,
the U. S. lost no time sticking its
foot into a messy state political pud*
die. Resigned was Gov. Richard W.
Leche, succeeded by the late Huey
P. ("K ingfish” ) Long’s brother,
E arl. One after another of Louisiana's
politicians were caught in the
trap, including Seymour Weiss, alleged
political “ powerhouse,” and
finally Richard Leche himself.
Humor had it that U. S. Attorney
General Frank Murphy was merely
using Louisiana as a proving ground
to show the Democratic party was
equal in purity to New York’s racket-
busting state’s attorney and G. O.
P. presidential possibility, Tom
Dewey. Whatever the reason, the
U. S. got its first conviction. Five
Louisianians, including Dr. Smith
and Seymour Weiss, were found
guilty of selling hotel furniture to
the state university, not once, but
twice. Basis for the federal charge;
A check for the ill-gotten gains was
sent through the U. S. mails.
Immediately the federal prosecutors
went to work on their second
case, an open-and-shut matter of interstate
commerce and therefore
clearly under U. S. jurisdiction. In
this trial, prosecutors hope to find
Messrs Weiss and Leche guilty of
conspiracy to violate the Connally
“ hot o il” law for allegedly piping
contraband oil to Texas.

W ar Talk
In 1917 it was public opinion that
forced the U. S. into war. In 1939,
as in 1914, public opinion wants no
truck with Europe’s troubles. But
Am erica’s memory of the war is
still so vivid that its citizenry’s judgment
is more reasoned, less apt to
be colored by propaganda from
home or abroad. Even so, there is
no unanimity.
Representative of anti-war thought
was the unprecedented radio talk by
Col. Charles A. Lindbergh, whose
congressman father committed po-

Choice. The four totalitarian nations
might decide to strike first and
talk peace later. Or they may poise
their threats and then sue. Whichever
course they take, Britain and
France are on the spot; never in
modern history have their empires
been so completely threatened.
Probably the better part of valor is

litical suicide by voting against war
in 1917: “ As long as we m aintain
an army, a navy and an air force
worthy of the name, as long as
America does not decay within, we
need fear no invasion . . . If we
enter fighting for democracy
abroad, we may end by losing it
at home.”
This was a fine spirit, as was the
G allup poll finding that 84 per cent
of the U. S. wants to keep American
ships out of war zones (a tenet
of the proposed neutrality act). But
America was nevertheless plugging
for France and Britain. Another
Gallup poll showed 82 per cent of
them thought the allies would win,
while 44 per cent (dangerously near
a majority for so early in the war)
favored sending U. S. troops abroad
if it appeared Germany would win.
Amid such befuddled opinion congress
met to argue the President’s
neutrality proposal: To repeal the
present arm s embargo and sell belligerents
anything they want, provided
they pay cash and use their
own ships. Isolationist sentiment
was growing, but so was “ cash-andc
a rry ” sentiment, simply a result of
greater public interest. Most popular
objection to neutrality revision
was not that it would discriminate
in faVbr of the allies (because they
rule the seas) but that common
sense overruled changing legislation
after the war has started.
Closer to trouble, more realistic
in its attitude, the state department
knew it must move chessmen as
belligerents moved theirs. Ex am ple:
Russo-Jap rapprochement
meant the Philippines might fall
easy prey to Tokyo unless the U. S.
delayed independence plans.
No easy job awaited congress.
Administration forces moved to lim it
debate and the nation both booed
and praised. No problem ever deserved
more thought and discussion,
yet, paradoxically, this was a problem
which seemed only to grow
more confusing when pondered and
debated.

WASHINGTON.—Those who wonder
why so m uch more war news—
and views—are coming out of Germany
than out of B ritain and
France would be interested to study
the newspaper files of the first world
war, not only for the first few
months, but for the first few years.
There has been much wonder,
also, since Germ any struck at Poland,
why so little has been heard
of Hitler. Since his celebrated announcement
of the “ line of succession”
should he meet death, almost
nothing has been heard of him.
In fact, this tightening up on news
of the Nazi chief has resulted in
mysterious reports of his suicide.
The reason the Germans are pouring
out news, while the British and
French are keeping quiet, is that
the Germans want to impress the
world in general, and Italy, France,
Britain, H ungary and R um a n ia in
particular, with the notion that the
Germans are invincible, that they
have already obtained their objectives,
and that what remains is
merely a long deadlock on the western
front, with punishing a ir raids
and destruction of shipping. So
why not have peace ?
That is the German propaganda
strategy now. In 1914 and 1915 the
strategy was very similar. Germ
a n victories, first in France and
then against Russia, and prospects
of a very long drawn out and bloody
war with no victory for either side
at the end. So why not peace and
let Germ any have what she had
won?
Study of those old newspaper files
will show some remarkable
“ scoops” by various press associations
and newspapers. In nearly
every case of such a “ scoop,’* the
source was Germ an There was
propaganda in every line of them,
no matter what the personal sympathies
of the m an who wrote the
articles, nor the editorial leanings
of the newspapers that printed
them.
N e w s W a s G e r m a n P r o p a g a n d a
I n E a r l y D a y s o f W o r l d W a r
This was not only true of Europe.
It was true of Washington and other
neutral capitals in the period from
August 1, 1914, to the entry of the
United States into the war.
For example, the best news source
for writers who had to do the neutrality
and notes of protest stories
from Washington in those days was
not some official at the White
House, or in the state department,
nor in any of the Allied embassies,
but none other than Count Von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador.
The writer happened at the time
to be in charge of the Washington
bureau of a New York newspaper
which was strongly pro-Ally, as indeed
was this writer himself during
that period.
Yet this writer produced columns
of type, averaging, as a study afterward
showed, something liko four
every week, which emanated solely
and entirely from the G e rm an embassy
^ fr o m the spoken words of
the shrewd Germ an diplomat.
It was Bernstorff who would tell
us, one at a time and with the
strongest insistence that his name
m ust not be mentioned or hinted,
what the next Germ an note would
say about the Lusitania. Even more
surprising, he would tell us, shortly
after that note had been received,
w hat the reply that Wilson would
dictate and Bryan would sign would
be! And he was not guessing. He
was in constant touch with the state
department and White House. O fficials
would tell h im , but they would
not tell the reporters!
The man who tells the story gets
the breaks!
H i g h O f f i c i a l F i g u r e s i n
B e s t S t t t r y o f t h e W a r
It s a dark secret who the gentleman
is, but a very high official of
the administration figured in the
best hum an interest story of the
war—if the details could just be
told.
It so happens that a great many
men and women of importance from
the home state of this official were
caught abroad at the outbreak of
the war, and could not get steam ship
accommodations. Not a cot
was to be had without waiting much
longer than these men and women,
with their imaginations working
overtime as to what the German
bombers were going to do to Britain,
wanted to endure.
So frantic cables galore were sent
from British and Scotch towns to
this official. With his usual thoroughness,
for this p articu lar official
won his spurs in the business
world before the New Deal was
heard of, he went to work. Soon he
discovered that a very good, though
i little known ship, was about to sail,
and that his friends in the British
government would be very glad to
put him under obligations to them.
So without further to-do he booked
all his friends. Any one studying
the passenger list, with home ad dresses,
would have been amazed
at how m any people happened to
get on this ship who were from the
state back in America from which
the statesman irArolved hailed.
Which was fine, except that the
ship was the Athenia!
W r i t e r B o o s t s G a r n e r a n d
G e t s H i s E m p l o y e r i n B a d
A certain well-known Washington
columnist, whose articles appear in
one of the Washington newspapers,
took his customary vacation up at
Nantucket island during the weeks
that preceded the outbreak of the
war in Europe. While he was on
vacation he had various friends,
ranging in importance from cabinet
members down to friendly news
writers, do his column for h im , and
these were duly printed in the
Washington newspaper which normally
carried his dispatches.
One of these articles was written
by the Washington correspondent
of a newspaper in Texas owned by
Jesse H. Jones. It m ay be rem em bered
that back in 1928, when the
Democratic national convention was
held in Jones’ home town, Houston,
there was a sizable demonstration
for Jesse Jones for President.
But the article written by Mr.
Jones’ Washington reporter did not
mention Jones, despite the fact that
there has been a good deal of talk
about his availability, in the event
that the party should go conservative.
No, Mr. Jones’ able news writer
made his column, pinch-hitting
for his vacationing friend, an essay
on the qualifications of John
Nance Garner, who also hails from
Texas.
The writer, Bascom Timmons by
name, started off with the statement
that Garner would make the
best President this country ever
had, and was the best qualified m an
in the country today for the office.
But you wouldn’t believe the repercussions.
Friends of P aul V.
McNutt indignantly demanded of
Jones what he was encouraging this
sort of thing for, when McNutt, Mr.
Jones’ co-worker in the New Deal
vineyard, was an avowed candidate
in thfeevent that F ran klin D.
Roosevelt wm self should not run!
O u t b r e a k o f W a r U p s e t s
P l a n s o f S e c r e t a r y W a l l a c e
Virtually every plan of Henry A.
Wallace, secretary of agriculture,
has gone out the window as a result
of the war in Europe. Demand for
every conceivable food product, and
incidentally even for cotton, has
changed the whole picture. Even
since the war broke out the AAA
experts on wheat insisted that the
expected demand did not justify
an increase in wheat acreage for
next season. But there will be.
Everybody who has ever had
m any dealings with farmers knows
what will happen. With an advancing
price and crisp demand, Mr.
F arm e r will plant more—even if he
knew the whole world was doing the
same thing. There might, he always
reasons, be a famine somewhere
else in the world. In fact,
he may not reason that much. He
just knows that buyers want his
wheat and are willing to pay h im a
higher price than he has been getting,
so he gets busy.
No farmer ever approved the crop
curtailm ent program—for his own
farm . Some of them think it is a
good idea for the other fellow.
They like to follow nature’s own
plan of providing a lot more of everything
than could possibly be
used.
But this tim e the farmers will be
right, if the best m ilitary and naval
experts this country has are right.
For this war, the experts calculate,
will stretch on and on. Five years,
most of them are saying.
A g r i c u l t u r a l O u t l o o k W a s
B a d B e f o r e D i s a s t e r B r o k e
Before this disaster broke upon a
dreading world, the agricultural
outlook was very dark indeed.
Hence the various plans under incubation
at the department of agriculture.
In its September business letter
the National City bank said: “ One
aspect of the situation which has
disturbed business observers is the
low price of farm products, notably
the grains, hogs and fats and oils.
The outlook has been improved during
August by the rally in wheat
prices, and it is likely that the
pessimism as to wheat was overdone,
inasmuch as the government
loan, on the basis of 80 cents at
Chicago, was always certain to help
the market as more wheat began
to move into the loan stock. But
the hog supply for the coming
months is admittedly of depressing
size and the supply of fats and oils
is above normal, with lard and cottonseed
oil both selling recently at
the lowest prices in five years.
Dairy and poultry products are lower
than last year.”
This was written, of course, before
the outbreak of war. It was
written when most people did not
expect war. Yet the very upturn
in wheat mentioned was probably
due more to buying by people who
did believe in the danger of war
than any government loan factor.
Next year’s crops, assuming good
weather, will probably be prodigious.
But, if war continues, they
will be badly needed and prices will
not be low. The real problem will
come, as it came after the last
war, when the war demand suddenly
ends.

It voted 50 to 21 to reaffirm its passage
of a bill to require the state to
pay for the construction and maintenance
of state trunk roads where

State Tax $86,000,000—The federal
government, levying more than 70
different taxes, collected $86,406,220
in Wisconsin in the 1939 fiscal year,
or 1.67 per cent of this year’s $5,-

The collections were 10.9 per cent
less than the $96,981,214 collection in

Jo h n Wilson Hart, 89, immediate past
Wisconsin department commander of
the Grand Army of the Republic,
died at La Crosse after a long illness.
He was the last survivor of the La

He enlisted as a drummer boy from
the 23rd Iowa Volunteer Infantry at
the age of 13.
Alderman Fined S700 — Alderman
M artin M. Higgins, Milwaukee, was
found guilty of gross official misconduct
by the common council and was
fined $700 as punishment. The council’s

unsubstantiated charges made by
Higgins of a money deal in a tavern
license transfer.
Electric Bills Law—Wisconsin residents
are using more electricity and
paying less per kilowatt hour than
the average customer in the United
States, the public service commission
announced. Electric rates of state
utilities are the lowest in history,
and consumption of electric energy
has increased about 26 per cent in
the last four years.
Vote $250,000 for School—The senate
voted $250,000 to be used toward
completing the industrial school for
girls at Oregon. While about $450,000
is necessary to complete the school,
the $250,000 appropriation would
| provide for enough construction to
j make the school usable. Construc-
J tion on the school, to replace the
I present school at Milwaukee, was
1 started 1 1 years ago, but was stopped

I 98 per cent of the Wisconsin state
trunk highway system was surfaced

state trunk highways were to be
brought to concrete or black top surface
this year.
Cigaret Tax Two Cents—A revenue
b ill to raise $1 0 ,2 0 0 , 0 0 0 for the
general fund through a two cent
cigaret tax and retention of the 60
per cent income surtax was sent to
the governor after the senate concurred
in assembly amendments
stripping it of diversion and earm
arking features. The revenue will
aid in meeting the state’s estimated

While the provision for d iversion
of gasoline tax monies from

the way open for possible diversion
at a later date.

X T E W Y O R K —M ahatm a Ghandi
* ' has indicated that, in his opinion,
a world war against Adolf H itler
would be justifiable and possibly
necessary. The
U n d e r ttu d y o f British, with
G a n d h i C alm s ‘ heir impera-
Ta w a r d B ritish »*ve Job of keepmg
their great
In dian empire in hand, probably
aren’t worrying about Gandhi. More
im portant is the attitude and activity
of his vigorous and popular understudy,
the 44-year-old Pandit
Jaw ah h arial Nehru. The latter has
been boldly resistant to British rule,
spent six years in ja il, and has acquired
popularity and leadership as
G andhi reaches his seventy-second
year.
Meager news reports from In d
ia indicate that Nehru has
been calming down in his agitation
against British im perialism,
and that, a few weeks ago,
he was vehemently denouncing
fascism and the new German
aggression. London is reassured,
but watchful, as Asia
may become a balance of power
in the clash of world dominions
and Nehru has been an active
propagandist of pan-Asiatic doctrine,
summoning browns and
blacks to resist what he believes
to be the aggression of the
whites.
Born of a noble caste, Nehru was
educated at H arrow and Cambridge,
taking honors in the classics. His
father, the P andit Motilal Nehru,
was a lawyer and the richest m an
in Allahabad. He gave away his
mansion and moved into a shabby
little house when he became a convert
to In dian nationalism.
His son, reared in splendor,
had no such ideas when he came
home from England. He was a
strong supporter of the British
regime until the Am ritsar massacre
of 1919. Then he burned
his 50 British suits, donned native
dress, and became an ag itator
for the Nationalist cause.
However, he was no devotee of
loin-cloth asceticism. He was
all for fighting and it was as the
most belligerent of all the In d
ian leaders that he came to
the presidency of the all-Indian
congress in 1935.
Nehru was at times sharply opposed
to the non-resisting Gandhi,
but apparently their differences
have been resolved. He is handsome
and engaging, vigorous assailant
of the ancient caste system
of India.
IT WAS not until a year ago that
* Rom ain Rolland returned to
France, after more than 20 years’
exile in Switzerland. He had opposed

deep-set eyes, but still “ above the

conscience of mankind.
He dispatched to the New York
international congress of the American
Musicological society a message
of good will. It is quoted here
in accord with this department’s
i w artim e alertness to such men and
messages. He says:
“ In the field of art, there is

only combat worthy of us is that

It was this sun that illumined
“ Jean Christophe,” one of the greatest
books of all times, published here
ju st before the World war, profound-

| and aspiring spirit of man. Many
times in recent years, Romain Rolland
has written that the world had
little hope of escaping another and
‘ possibly last devastating war. But,
described as “ an old man, broken

“We love you and we will all do
owr best to make you happy,” said
the Maharanee. ‘‘But the astrologer
says this is a time of great crisis
for us. I believe you are a sending,
as we call it. There are many
sendings just now, and they are badly
mixed. They are contradictory
and in opposition to one another.
His Highness my husband is so anxious
to make a good impression on
Captain Norwood. It is so im portant.
Will you help us to make a
good impression on h im ? ”
‘‘But I might do the wrong thing!
I m ight say the wrong word. I

Am I in on an intrigue?” asked
Lynn.
‘‘Yes, dear, a very serious intrig
ue .”
“ Oh, what fun! Is it dangerous?”
“ The astrologer says that it might
become dangerous.”
‘‘Maharanee dear, this sounds
wonderful! Is it a real dark oriental
intrigue?”
The Maharanee laughed amiably,
after a second’s hesitation and with
noticeable effort:
‘‘Yes, dear, it is certainly dark.
It is secret, and it has to do with a
diamond mine, but I hope you won’t
mention that to anyone.”
“ I ’m glad you warned me. Of
course, I won’t mention it.”
C H A PT E R IV
Captain Carl Norwood’s tent faced
the Kadur River. About a mile
away, it resembled a moonlit irregular
ribbon of silver streaming
from the enormous temple; and the
temple was a citadel of mystery
that loomed against Indian night.
There was a stillness that seemed
like the womb of music, into which
the clatter and voices from the camp
kitchen fell naturally and the hoofbeats
of a cantering horse thudded
on dusty earth like calculated d rum beats.
A shadow that was a horse was
reined in with unnecessary vigor.
A palace messenger dismounted.
Norwood's servant, careful for his
m aster’s dignity, accepted a silver
tube with the a ir of conferring a
favor.
Norwood opened the tube, after he
had made sure that the servant had
withdrawn to a sufficient distance.
Then he went to the table and wrote,
inserted his own letter into the tube
and returned it to the messenger,
who cantered away.
“ Tell Moses I want h im .”
Moses O ’Leary came and stood in
the door of the tent. *
‘‘I ’ve been invited to the palace
for supper.”
“ I haven’t had time yet, sir, to
find out much about what’s doing at
the palace.”
“ Has anyone from the palace been
enquiring about m e ? ”
“ Yes, sir. Prince R und h ia’s servant
came asking if you’d need to
borrow a horse. He knew you d id n ’t,
because we were standing right under
our horses’ noses when he asked
the question. Besides, I weren’t
the right person to ask. But he
slipped me a box o’ the P rince’s
cigars and asked a lot about you.”
“ What did you tell h im ? ”
“ Me? I told h im you’re the mildest
m an on earth, and how nothing
interests you so much as running
surveys.”
“ What did you find out?”
“ Same as I told you—not much.
He had his orders, and he hadn’t
had time to forget ’em, and he’s
scared o’ the Prince. I got a line
on the Prince all right. His brains
are made o’ curry powder and red
pepper. He’s about as safe to tackle
as a she-cobra that has just laid
her eggs. He’s what they call a
steamer.”
“ What do you m ean?”
“ Nothing for nothing. Lavish—at
cent per cent. He’d give you anybody’s
money, if he knew what he
was getting for it.”
• I f I should hear of your taking
his money, you’ll find yourself in serious
trouble.”
“ Me?”
•'Yes. Y ob.”
“ I ’m incorruptible.”
“ What else did you find out?”
“ Nothing, excep’ what I ’ve already
told you. There’s a Mrs.
Harding and a Miss Harding at the
guesthouse. Mrs. Harding has a
hurt foot and has been attended by
Prince R und h ia’s doctor. Miss H arding
has already met Rundhia, and
they've talked.”
“ What about the doctor r*
•'He’* no good.”
**No good in what way?”
“ No self-respect. Scared. He lets
the Prince brow-beat h im —takes a
tongue lashing without answering
back—lets himself be treated like a
dog—no dignity excep’ when the
Prince isn't looking.”
“ Nothing new about Noor Mahla
m ? ”
“ No. I reckon they’ll call him off.
He was just a try-out, that’s all he
was—sort o’ skirmisher to feel out
the lay of the land.”
“ Find out all you can about Prince
R u nd h ia .”
“ That ought to be easy. I ’ll go to
the bazaar tonight.”
Nothing was ever quite like it in
K adur’s history. Plumbing, electric
light, modern furniture, and even
the will to do it can’t make an In dian
palace, dusty with tradition,
lend itself to what the Maharanee
kept insisting was a picnic. She
wanted to be so modern and unconventional
that even Rundhia would
approve. Sullenly defied by the outraged
head-steward, whose turban
almost rose from his hair with horror,
she dismissed h im and took
charge.
The eventual compromise was
something between a bean-feast and
a banquet, in the glass-roofed patio,
am id a forest of potted palms and
canaries in silver cages. There were
Chinese lanterns and an utter drunkenness
of flowers. The long table
was loaded with silver and gold.
Norwood found himself between
the Maharanee and Aunty.
But there were paper napkins (those
were Lynn’s suggestion).
The Maharanee summoned the
Keeper of the Jewels, selected a
cluster of the most famous diamonds
from the Kadur collection, and
pinned it artfully on Lynn’s black
silk. Lynn looked stunning in embroidered
black silk. It showed off
her eyes and her golden hair. Excitement
made her parted lips so
kissable that the Maharanee had
qualms of conscience.
“ Darling, my nephew Rundhia is
a bad boy! Be ca re fu l!”
Lynn laughed. The prospect of
annoying Aunty was delicious. Aunty
would be scandalized by high jink?
in a palace. Aunty was one of those
people who think that palace life
should be like one endless coronation
ceremony in Westminster Abbey.
She could count on Aunty to
keep Rundhia within bounds.
The first arrival was Rundhia, in
dinner jacket and turban of cloth of
silver, critical of the cocktails; he
introduced ingredients learned in
Europe. He watched Lynn. He
made apparently random remarks
to discover her system, in case she
had one.
“ Miss Harding, you look innocent,
gay and very beautiful. But I mistrust
you. Your emotions seem to
me to be too honest. You will go
home and laugh at us all.”
“ Going home soon,” Lynn answered.
“ Aunty didn’t laugh when
she said that. She meant it
“ Is that what amuses you?
“ No. I ’d rather stay here. *ove
it.”
“ 1 wonder what you mean by love
it. Do you love u s?”
“ I love the Maharanee. And I
love these pussy-footed eastern
nights. I ’m wild about it all. I
ean't bear the thought of going home
yet.”
Rundhia smiled.
The sheep-faced M aharajah entered,
toadied by attendants, who
arranged the cushir for him in a
chromium-plated arm chair at the
end of the long room. Too polite to
speak any other language than E nglish
in Lynn’s presence, he frowned
sullenly at Rundhia and refused a
cocktail:
“ Your Bengali d id n’t bring my
tonic.”
“ Sorry,” said Rundhia. “ He was
attending to Mrs. Harding. He
hasn’t forgotten it.”
Then came Norwood. Hot night
though it was, he was in full mess
uniform, not whites. Shorter than
Rundhia; but five feet eleven inches
is, after all, plenty, if it’s built right
and properly carried. Ru nd h ia’s six
feet one, and almost perfect features,
somehow weren’t so noticeable
after Norwood came into the
room. Norwood had red hair and
one of those bits of moustaches that
draw attention to the line of his
lips. His red shell jacket gloved a
vigorous torso. There was nothing
meek about h im ; nothing arrogant.
He was a British gentleman in uniform,
as unself conscious as a visitor
at the zoo.
He recognized Lynn instantly. His
expression changed to let her know
he recognized her. But he was im perturbable.
Nothing surprised him.
The palace chamberlain presented
him to the M aharajah and the M aharanee.
He was gracious to them.
The Maharanee introduced him to
Lynn. He studied her. He smiled.
He said:
“ How do you do. We have met,
I believe. I am very curious. Don’t
tell me. It might spoil the fun of
finding out. Am I to sit next to you
at dinner? I was always lucky.”
Then he walked up and shook
hands with Rundhia: “ Pleased.”
“ Yes. Nice to meet you.”
It suggested the well-oiled motion
of machine-guns getting ready. They
were enemies, at sight, as charmed
to meet each other as match and
powder barrel. Lynn knew it instantly.
Then Aunty arrived. After that,
there was nothing to do but to listen
to Aunty’s distant condescensions.
She was wonderful. Even Rundhia
• admired her spunk. Dressed in a
formal evening gown on purpose to
make Lynn feel ashamed of herself,
taped and strapped by the doctor
until she could hardly move, in
torture from the twisted ankle, she
proposed to dominate that company.
She did, until Norwood subdued
her. She wasn’t used to being
snubbed by mere captains.
‘‘W'hat do Engineer officers d o ?”
she demanded.
“ Nothing,” he said, “ except answer
questions. Why? I might lend
you a m an who can do things.”
The M aharajah was interrupted
by the arrival of the Bengali doctor,
followed by a servant with a big
blue goblet on a tray. The M aharaja
h swallowed the contents of the
goblet in one long draught and Norwood
noticed that he became im m e diately
more at ease. But Norwood
was also watching Rundhia, who
left off dancing with Lynn and accompanied
the Bengali to the door,
talking to h im low-voiced.
Norwood promptly commandeered
Lynn.
“ If I were you,” he said, “ I ’d
stick to champagne. The cocktails
taste phoney.”
Lynn wasn’t sure she liked him.
On the other hand, she wasn’t sure
she d id n’t.
“ Why were you rude to A unty?”
“ She was rude to m e ,” he answered.
“ She had an accident today, so
she isn’t herself.”
“ Who is? You, for instance? P rin cess?
Cinderella on her night out?
Or rebel? You know what happens
to rebels, don’t you, unless their
friends are reliable?”
A great gong boomed. It was as
ancient as the palace. It was the
bronze voice of memory.
“ P icnic!” exclaimed the Maharanee.
“ No formality. Lynn, dear,
lead the way. We will all follow.”
So the Maharajah came last, to
the servants* horror, and it was
Lynn who contrived the seating.
Norwood’s luck suffered a flat tire.
He found himself between the M aharanee
and Aunty. Rundhia and
Lynn sat opposite: the Maharajah
at one end of the table, the Maharanee
at the other.
The M aharajah only pretended to
eat. In theory, he had abandoned
caste restrictions, but in practice,
he lacked the Maharanee’s courage.
He wilted under Aunty Harding’s
barrage of remarks. Her vigor depressed
him . Aunty had no patience
with weaklings:
“ You’re a hypochondriac,” she
told him.
The M aharajah sighed. “ I am a
victim of public duty. Affairs of
state impose a sedentary life that
has ruined m y health. But I have
found that Ru nd h ia’s physician understands
m y ailment.”
The physician reappeared in the
doorway, nervous, unself-assertive.
He came behind Aunty’s chair and
whispered to her. Norwood couldn’t
hear what he said, but he saw him
lay two pellets on a plate at Aunty’#
right hand.
“ Drugs! No thank you!”
“ What are they?” asked the M aharajah.
“ Exactly the same that your H ighness
has been taking for your
nerves,” said the physician
“ I have iron nerves,” said Aunty.
The physician smiled. He separated
the two pellets with a fork
and held the plate toward the Maharajah.
“ Set her the example,” he suggested.
“ My monotonous life consists of
nothing else than setting good examples,”
said the Maharajah. “ If
it won’t hurt me, it won’t hurt you.”
He reached for a pellet.
Norwood noticed that the doctor
moved the plate so that the Mahara
ja h ’s fingers closed on the one
that had been nearer Aunty. If it
was a trick it was smooth. Rundhia
was paying rather witty attention to
Lynn; he was making her laugh.
“ As a compliment, but against my
better judgm ent.” said Aunty. She
swallowed the other pellet.
“ Thank you,” said the Bengali.
“ Thank you, m ad am . That relieves
my anxiety. You should not be
here. You should be in bed. There
is no knowing what people’s nerves
may do to them when they have suffered
a bodily shock such as you received
this afternoon.”
He bowed himself out.
Aunty used her napkin suddenly.
Norwood watched her. He was just
in time to prevent her falling from
the chair. Everyone, including the
Maharajah, jumped up. Lynn ran
to her. The servants formed a
scrimmage around Lynn and Aunty.
The M aharajah scolded the Maharanee
sotto voce.
Rundhia sent a servant running
for the doctor. The other servants
picked up Aunty and carried her
into the next room, where she
groaned on a couch and netrly fainted
from humiliation. Rundhia met
the doctor at the door. Norwood,
watching them, pretended not to,
wasn’t certain whether they spoke.
The doctor nodded, put on his most
judicial professional air, felt Aunty’s
pulse and shrugged his shoulders.
“ She has a temperature. It is
impossible to say, but I think she
is only suffering from nervous exhaustion
and perhaps, too, from
mental disturbance.” He turned
again to the Maharanee: “ I advise
that Miss Lynn Harding should be
moved into the palace, so that Mrs.
Harding may be quiet.”

“ White Streak in the Water”
He l l o e v e r y b o d y :
Bill Mogge says he has nothing to kick about, and that’s
a swell way of looking at it. And at the same time I ’m wondering
how many other people could go through what Bill did, and
suffer as Bill suffered, and lose as Bill lost and still take that
same attitude that Bill takes about what happened to him in the
dreadful hours that followed his seeing a white line shoot toward
him across the wind-tossed waters of the North sea.
That white line was a common sight on the North sea in
World war days. It meant bad luck to the ship from which it
was seen, and that was no mere sailors’ superstition either. Bill
saw it on July 29, 1915, from the Belgian steamer Princesse
Marie, on which he was working as an able seaman. And now
the Princesse Marie is at the bottom of the sea, several of her
crew are dead, and Bill Mogge has some terrible hours to
remember.
Bill lives in Nutley, N. J. He has a wife and a thirteenyear-
old daughter, and he says, “ Life is good, after all.”
But on that July day in 1915 his prospects for continuing that
life began to look as though they weren't worth a plugged nickel. Then
he was a young Dutch lad working on that Belgian ship for the extra
ten shillings that were handed out every month to the men who risked
death in the submarine-infested war zone. Bill and the boatswain were
I up on a scaffold washing the sides of the wheelhouse and the bridge
when Bill looked off over the water to starboard and saw that white
streak.
Streak Headed for Center of Ship.
Bill says he froze in his shoes. Every sailor knew what that
streak meant. Torpedo! And this streak was headed riijht for
the center of the ship— right for the spot below the wheelhouse
on which he and the boatswain were working.
“ Like a m an in a dream I watched that white mark grow longer,”
1 he says. “ It was almost on us, and I knew there wasn’t time to avoid
! it. Almost at the same instant I saw a periscope come out of the water.
I shouted to the bos’n, but I ’ll never know whether he heard me or not.
For at that same instant there was a terrific explosion, and everything
went black before my eyes.”
When R ill came to again he was lying on the deck in a lot of
debris—and a pool of blood. The ship had all but broken in two.
Water was rushing into it and it was sinking fast. Kill tried to
get to his feet, but he couldn’t move. His arm hurt, and his
head seemed to be spinning around like a top. “ I tried to
shake off that dizzy feeling,” he says, “ but it was no use. Blood
was running into my eyes from a wound in my head, and my
injured arm was useless. I thought I would go crazy as I lay
there, unable to move, while the ship sank steadily, threatening
every moment to go under.”
But at last Bill managed to pull himself together. He struggled to
his feet and looked about him. The decks were deserted. His right

O M Experiment Measures W eight o f Karth
The measuring of the mass or
weight of the earth is a fam iliar
astronomical problem. Other bodies
are weighed by measuring the
attraction of the earth upon them ;
the same end is accomplished in the
case of the earth, by comparing the
attraction which this globe exerts
upon some body on its surface with
the attraction exerted upon the same
body by a known mass at a known
distance.
There have been several methods
tried to accomplish this, the simplest
of which is that of observing the deviation
from the vertical of a plumbline
near an isolated mountain. The
volume of the mountain must first
be found, of course, by accurate
survey, and its density calculated
from the geological structure and
density of its component rocks. But
this plan, though simple, is not nearly
as accurate in result as that of
computation by means of the torsion
balance This method is known
to astronomers as the “ Cavandish
experiment,” from the scientist who
first applied it in 1789.
Cavendish’s methods consists of
measuring very accurately the attraction
exerted by two large
spheres o f metal, on two much
smaller metal balls. Two globes of
lead are attached to the extremities
of a large horizontal bar, movable,
horizontally, upon a center.
Above this center a light horizontal
rod, having on its ends two very
small balls of load, is supported by a
fine wire. When the rod bearing
the small balls is in equilibrium, the
ball having the globes of lead is
moved until these globes are brought
nearly in contact with the small
balls. The force of their attraction
then tends to draw the small rod
from its position of equilibrium, and
the amount of torsion thus produced
is measured carefully.
This experiment is repeated several
times, and the average of its results
taken, so as to be as nearly
accurate as possible. It is plain that
the attraction of the large globes on
the small ball is to the attraction of
the earth upon the sm all balls—i. e.,
their weight—as the mass of the
large balls is to the mass of the
earth.
The result of these experiments has
given the weight of the earth approximately
as 6.000,000,000,0 0 0 .0 0 u.u0 0 ,-
0 0 0 tons.
“ At the same instant there was a terrific explosion, and everything
went black before my eyes.”
arm was covered with blood and nearly blown off. Using his left arm,
he climbed the ladder to the boat deck—but there were no boats there
any more. His shipmates had gone, leaving him to drown.
Last Life Boat K cady to Shove Off.
Just as B ill was ready to give up he looked over the side, and that
look saved his life. Down there in the water was just one lifeboat—the
last one—getting ready to shove off. Bill knew he didn’t have a moment
to lose. Those lads in the boat weren’t going to wait for stragglers.
He had to get in that boat or go down with the ship, and the only way
to get into it in time was to jum p for it. Bill did jum p—right from the
boat deck. He landed in a heap on top of a bunch of cursing sailors
who wanted to know who he was.
“ I thought they were crazy to ask such a question,” says
Bill. “ D id n’t they know me—their shipmate—any more? Little
did 1 realize how I looked to them. I was just a black and
bloody mess that even my own mother wouldn't have recojjniied.”
L ife b o a t S t e a m s F u l l Sp e e d T ow a rd H a rw ic h .
The boat had no sooner pulled away than the ship sank with a groan
and a hiss of steam. B ill lay in the bottom while the others rowed.
“ My head was burning,” he says, “ and I thought I would go crazy. Off
and on I did go out of my mind. About an hour later we were picked
up by a British mine sweeper. They pulled me up in a canvas because
I was too weak to clim b aboard. Some officer put an emergency
bandage around my head, and they kept giving me coffee and cigarettes
to keep me alive. We steamed full speed toward Harwich, the nearest
port where there was a hospital.”
Kadio messages to shore had told the hospital of their coming,
and there was an ambulance waiting for Hill at the dock.
“ When I got to the hospital,” says Bill, “ I felt somehow that
I would be safe, and didn't fight any more against the darkness
that kept trying tc close down over my eyes. I don’t know what
happened after that, but when I awoke the nurse told me I had
been unconscious for two days.”
They did their best for Bill at that hospital—in spite of the fact that
he was a Hollander and the English had just about all they could do o
take care of their own wounded who were coming over every day from
France. One day a nurse started to teach him to'write with his left hand
—and then Bill knew he would never use his right arm again.
When his wounds had healed up the Dutch consul general
nent Kill to a hospital in Holland, and there he spent two more
years while the doctors performed flve operations trying to give
him back the use of his arm , and a little while after he was discharged
he came to America.
And after all he went through, Bill still says he has no kick coming.
‘‘The Belgian government awarded me a pension,” he says, “ and I arn
grateful to that country for the square deal it gjive me. I ’ll never
forget the wonderful treatment I got in the British hospital, and I am
thankful to America for the wonderful opportunities it has given me.”
And that’s from a bird who really got a tough break and has every
right in the world to complain about his luck.

Sorry, Mr. Heal, that you “jjot us
wrong,” as revealed in your editorial
in the Evening Leader on Saturday,
in which you hint that we are playing
Antigo*s game in its bid for business
in this territory. We were, in
the article alluded to, “plugging” for
Highway 45 on its old route and its
improvement per se and not because
of any benefits that might come to
Antigo in a business way as a result.
We have too much concern for the
welfare of Wittenberg to be working
along lines that might help either
Wausau, Antigo or Shawano in grabbing
off business that can be taken
care of here. As for those things not
supplied here, it’s all the same to us
where people get them. But if Shaw
ano really does have a sisterly feel
ing for Wittenberg, and we over here
in this end of the county become
aware of it, the fact of its being our
county seat is going to have a bearing
when we are obliged to go to some
larger own for what we can’t get here.

A Riddle— Hannah More—
I ’m a strange contradiction; I ’m new,I
and I ’m old.
I ’m often in tatters, and oft decked
with gold.
Though I never could read, yet lettered
I ’m found;
Though blind, I enlighten; though
loose, I am bound,
I ’m always in black, and I ’m always in
white;
I ’m grave and I ’m gay, I am heavy and |
light—
In form too I differ,— I ’m thick and
I ’m thin.
I’ve no flesh and no bones, yet I ’m
covered with skin;
I’ve more points than the compass,
more stops than the flute;
I sing without voice, without speaking
confute.
I ’m English. I ’m German, I ’m French,
and I ’m Dutch;
Some love me too fondly, some slight
me too much;
I often die soon, though I sometimes
live ages,
And no monarch alive has so many]
pages.

“ Please.” Said the Book
A Thought for all Wisconsin Children
“ Please,” said the book, “will you
handle me carefully,
Treat me with kindness and see that
I ’m neat?
Use me, of course, but I beg of you
prayerfully
Not to be rough like some people I
meet.”
“ Please,” said the book, “ W'ill yo u 1

U 7 P V E all heard of “killing two birds with one
stone,” but how many of us have ever killed
two foxes with one bullet from a gun "that wasn’t
loaded” ?
According to the report, Christopher Moederl, a
resident of Rosenheim, Germany, was taking his rifle
into Munich to have the sights adjusted when he
slipped, in climbing a fence, and the gun was discharged.
The bullet passed through the first fox,
ricocheted from a rock and killed the mate. The gun
was not supposed to have been loaded, according to
Moederi’s statement.

L J IS master traded a broken-down
* * race horse, worth about $300,
for George Washington Carver
when he was a little pickaninny
just before the Civil war. Today,
hc is the pride of the negro race.
A worn-out speller was the only
education available to him until he
was ten years old. w'hen he attended
a small school in Neosho, Mo. He
slept in a barn there and did odd
jobs to earn a living while learning.
The young negro boy’s thirst
for knowledge grew, and he went
on to finish his elementary school
education in Fort Scott, Kan., where
he worked as a hotel cook, a dishwasher.
and a housekeeper. Later
he bent over wash tubs night after
night doing laundry for people, to
pay his way through high school. He
worked as a hotel clerk for awhile
and then entered Simpson college
at Indianola. Iowa, where he earned
his tuition by doing odd jobs.
Three years later, George Washington
Carver went on to Iowa State
university, graduating with a degree
in agriculture. In two more
years he won his Master of S ience
degree, and was made a member of
the faculty, so impressive were his
accomplishments in agricultural
chemistry. In 1897, he took charge
of the agricultural department at
Tuskegee institute, ii A labama,
leading negro university.
The contributions George Washington
Carver has made to agriculture
of the South are outstanding.
He was among the first to advocate
crop rotation for worn-out soil and
he has developed hundreds of commercially
useful articles from the
principal agricultural products of
Southern states. F rom the peanut
alone Carver made 235 products and
from the sweet potato 118. Thomas
A. Edison once invited him to work
with him , but he preferred to concentrate
on problems of southern
agriculture.
In addition to his prominence in
science, George Washington Carver
is an accomplished enough musician
to have toured the Middle West as
a concert pianist. He has won laurels
as an artist in many exhibitions,
and one of his paintings is to
hang in the Luxembourg galleries of
Paris.

Amazing Reports of Relief With
Williams Formula Create
Sensation Here.
Men and women from far and near
are flocking daily to their druggist
to get Williams Formula,the famous
medicine which is attracting widespread
attention. People suffering
from acid indigestion, stomach gas,
sick-headaches, nervousness, dizziness,
“half-alive” feeling because of excess
acidity and lazy elimination declare
they can hardly believe the remarkable
relief they have experienced from
taking Williams Formula. Floods of
letters have been pouring in from
grateful users, praising this remarkable
medicine.
Typical of these letters is the
statament of Mr. Wm. Bonlander, a
woll known resident of Fond du Lac,
W'is., who says:
“ Some foods I would eat have both-
MR. WM. BONLANDER
ed to use Williams Formula and have
found that this medicine gives me
much relief from this gas and bloating
due to an acid stomach and lazy bowels.
I am very grateful to have thi9
ered me by turning sour and creating opportunity of endorsing such a fine
gas pressure in my stomach. I start-j formula as W IL L IAM S FORMULA.”

WITTKN BERG WIS.
Dear Friend:
Here is good news that may mean
happiness for you if you suffer from j
Rheumatic, Neuritic, or Neuralgic;
Pain Attacks.
You know what it means to your J
work—to your family—and to your |
own enjoyment and happiness, to find
relief from these pain attacks. That
is why we are Happy to bring you
this good news about RUX Compound.
Flocks of people come into our j
store every week, and ask us to take
time off to tell them about RUX. We
are glad to do this, and it is with tho ;
thought of passing information on to!
you who have not yet come to o u r !
store for this fine medicine, that we
are presenting this message.
Thousands of people over the coun- j
try are users of RUX, and words of
gratitude for the relief it gives in
Rheumatic, Neuralgic or Neuritic Pain
attacks are heard on every hand. We
believe the following letter from Mr.
Herman Koehler, 821* Christiana St.,
Green Bay, Wfis., expresses how others
feel about RUX and shows how they
praise it to their friends and neighbors.
Mr. Koehler says: "I am writ-
MR. HERMAN KO KIILBR
ing this statement for the purpose of
telling other Rheumatic Pain sufferers ’
how much RUX Compound helped me.
For some time 1 have been having!
Rheumatic Pains in my legs and
hands. At times it would feel as thol
some one were jabbing me with aj
sharp knife. I heard of RUX Compound
and decided to try it. I can say i
that RUX certainly help ~ l:
these pains fast. I can recommend
RUX highly for what it has done
for me.”
This is but one of the many, many
letters received by the makers of
RUX, praising this remarkable medicine.
and although this sufferer’s
experience may not be in the least
like yours, we want you to know that
his praise for RUX is sincere and is
given freely so that you and other
people will hear about. RUX and be
able to try R for yourself.
When relief from Rheumatic, Neuralgic
or Neuritic Pain may mean so
much to your happiness, and even
your success in life, surely you owe
it to yourself to at least learn more
about this remarkable medicine, RUX.
We are daily meeting people in our
store and showing them The RUX
and telling them about how its valuable
ingredients act. When you decide
to try RU X—today or tomorrow,
if possible—come into our store and
we will be glad to tell you about this
fine medicine which is bringing relief
and comfort to many other sufferers.

Sorry, Mr. Heal, that you “ j?ot us
wrong,” as revealed in your editorial
in the Evening Leader on Saturday,
in which you hint that we are playing
Antigo’s game in its bid for business
in this territory. We were, in
the article alluded to, “ plugging” for
Highway 45 on its old route and its
improvement per se and not because
of any benefits that might come to
Antigo in a business way as a result.
We have too much concern for the
welfare of Wittenberg to be working
along lines that might help either
Wausau, Antigo or Shawano in grabbing
off business that can be taken
care of here. As for those things not
supplied here, it’s all the same to us
where people get them. But if Shaw
ano really does have a sisterly feel
ing for Wittenberg, and we over here
in this end of the county become
aware of it, the fact of its being our
county seat is going to have a bearing
when we are obliged to go to some
larger own for what we can’t get here.
Books may be lost if they’re carelessly
le nt?”
“ Please,” said the book, “There is
almost no end to me!
Treasures I own that are better than
gold!
If you will love me and show you’re a
friend to me,
How I will cherish you when you are
old!”

A Riddle— Hannah More—
I’m a strange contradiction; I ’m new,
and I ’m old.
I ’m often in tatters, and oft decked
with gold.
Though I never could read, yet letter- j
ed I’m found;
Though blind, I enlighten; though!
loose, I am bound,
I ’m always in black, and I ’m always in
white;
I ’m grave and I ’m gay, I am heavy and !
light—
In form too I differ,— I ’m thick and
I ’m thin,
I ’ve no flesh and no bones, yet I ’m
covered with skin;
I ’ve more points than the compass,
more stops than the flute;
I sing without voice, without speak-J
ing confute.
I ’m English, I'm German. I ’m French,
and I ’m Dutch;
Some love me too fondly, some slight
me too much;
I often die soon, though I sometimes
live ages,
And no monarch alive has so many
pages.

Use me, of course, but I beg of you

Not to be rough like some people I

\ I/ ’E ’VE all heard of “ killing two birds with one
? * stone,” but how many of us have ever killed
two foxes with one bullet from a gun “that wasn’t
loaded” ?
According to the report, Christopher Moederi, a
resident of Rosenheim, Germany, was taking his rifle
into Munich to have the sights adjusted when he
slipped, in climbing a fence, and the gun was discharged.
The bullet passed through the first fox,
ricocheted from a rock and killed the mate. The gun
was not supposed to have been loaded, according to
Moederi’s statement.

L J IS master traded a broken-down
* * race horse, worth about $300,
for George Washington Carver
when he was a little pickaninny
just before the Civil war. Today,
he is the pride of the negro race.
A worn-out speller was the only
education available to h im until he
w’as ten years old, w'hen he attended
a small school in Neosho, Mo. He
slept in a barn there and did odd
jobs to earn a living w’hile learning.
The young negro boy’s thirst
for knowledge grew, and he went
on to finish his elementary school
education in Fort Scott, Kan., where
he worked as a hotel cook, a dishwasher,
and a housekeeper. Later
he bent over wash tubs night after
night doing laundry for people, to
pay his way through high school. He
worked as a hotel cJerk for awhile
and then entered Simpson college
at Indianola. Iowa, where he earned
his tuition by doing odd jobs.
Three years later, George Washington
Carver went on to Iowa State
university, graduating with a degree
in agriculture. In tv;o more
years he won his Master of S ience
degree, and was made a member of
the faculty, so impressive were his
accomplishments in agricultural
chemistry. In 1897, he took charge
of the agricultural departm ent at
Tuskegee institute, ii Alabama,
leading negro university.
The contributions George Washington
Carver has made to agriculture
of the South are outstanding.
He was among the first to advocate
crop rotation for worn-out soil and
he has developed hundreds of commercially
useful articles from the
principal agricultural products of
Southern states. From the peanut
alone Carver made 285 products and
from the sweet potato 118. Thomas
A. Edison once invited h im to work
with him , but he preferred to concentrate
on problems of southern
agriculture.
In addition to his prominence in
science, George Washington Carver
is an accomplished enough m usician
to have toured the Middle West as
a concert pianist. He has won laurels
as an artist in many exhibitions,
and one of his paintings is to
hang in the Luxembourg galleries of
Paris.

A mazing Reports of Relief With
Williams Formula Create
Sensation Here.
Men and women from far and near
are flocking daily to their druggist
to get Williams Formula,the famous
medicine which is attracting widespread
attention. People suffering
from acid indigestion, stomach gas,
sick-headaches, nervousness, dizziness,
"half-alive” feeling because of excess
acidity and lazy elimination declare
they can hardly believe the remarkable
relief they have experienced from
taking Williams Formula. Floods of
letters have been pouring in from
grateful users, praising this remarkable
medicine.
Typical of these letters is thc
statament of Mr. Wm. Bonlander, a
well known resident of Fond du Lac,
Wis., who says:
“Some foods I would eat have bothered
me by turning sour and creating
gas pressure in my stomach. I start-
MR. WM. BONLANDER
ed to use Williams Formula and have
found that this medicine gives me
much relief from this gas and bloating
due to an acid stomach and lazy bowels.
I am very grateful to have this
opportunity of endorsing such a fine
formula as W IL L IAM S FO RMULA .”

A PERSONAL MESSAGE for Every Man and Woman who is

or who ha.s friends who are. this Information mav be of VITAL
IMPORTANCE!
Dear Friend:
Here is good news that may mean
happiness for you if you suffer from
Rheumatic, Neuritic, or Neuralgic i
Pain Attacks.
You know what it moans to your
work— to your family— and to your
own enjoyment and happiness, to find
relief from these pain attacks. That
is why wo are Happy t-> bring you
this good news about RUX Compound.;
Flocks o f people come into our
store every week, and ask us to take
time off to tell them about RUX. We
are glad to do this, and it is with tho
thought of passing information on to
you who have not yet come to o u r!
store for this fine medicine, that we:
are presenting this message.
Thousands of people over the coun-
J try are users of RUX , and words of
gratitude for the relief it gives in
Rheumatic, Neuralgic or Neuritic Pain
attacks are heard on every hand. We
believe the following letter from Mr.
Herman Koehler, 821* Christiana St.,
(»ri*en Bay, Wis., expresses how others
feel about RUX and shows how they
praise it to their friends and neighbors.
Mr. Koehler says: “I am writ-
MR. II Fit MAN KOI IIL I.lt
injr this statement for tho purpose of
tolling other Rheumatic Pain sufferers
how much RUX Compound helped mo.
For > »rno time I have been having
Rheumatic Pains in my legs and
hands. At times it would feel as tho
some one were jabbing me with a
sharp knife. 1 heard of R l'X Compound
and decided to try it. I can say
that RUX certainly helps relieve
these pains fast. I can recommend
RUX highly for what it has done
for me.”
This is but one of tho many, many
letters received by tho makers of
RUX, praising this remarkable medicine,
and although this sufferer’s
experience may not be in the least
like yours, wo want you to know that
his pm'so for RUX is sincere and is
given freely so that you and other
people will hear about RUX and be
able to try it for yourself.
When relief from Rheumatic, Neuralgie
or Neuritic Pain may mean so
much to your happiness, and even
your success in life, surely you owe
it to yourself to at. least learn more
about this remarkable medicine, RUX.
We are daily meeting people in our
store and showing them The RUX
and telling them about how its valuable
ingredients act. When you decide
to try RIJX today or tomorrow,
if possible—come into our store and
we will bo glad to tell you about this
fine medicine which is bringing relief
and comfort to many other sufferers.

DON'T T HESE LOOK AWFUL GOOD?
(Recipes Below.)
My Favorite Recipe*
Lucky, indeed, is the homemaker
who has among her treasured recipes
Aunt M artha’s “ receipt” for soft
molasses cookies. Mother’s rule for
old-fashioned apple pan dowdy, or
grandmother’s instructions for m aking
home-baked beans. Those old,
favorite recipes are the mainstay
of many a tempting meal.
Each one of us has our own prized
collection of just such recipes—some
old, some new, but all of them tried
and approved by a critical family.
The recipes I ’m giving you today
are some of m y own favorites—fam ily

excellent cooks.
When you're a “ seasoned” or experienced
cook you may take liberties
with a recipe or with directions,
but if you’re a beginner, or
if you're trying a new dish for the
first time, it's better to stick to a
proven recipe and the accurate
measurements it calls for.
Accuracy in cooking means level
teaspoons and tablespoons and cups
in the amounts the recipe specifies;
it means sifting flour once before
measuring; combining ingredients
by the method given, and cooking or
baking according to time and temperature
recommended.

• MISTAKES WILL HAP■
jH'ti and children often regret
them as much as their
jtarents. Confidence comes
much easier if child is sure
he will receive fair treatment
for self-admitted mistakes.
By MA RION B R OW N F IE L D
T) ETTY, aged 11, was in the kitch-
^ en washing the dinner dishes
while her father and some relatives
were visiting in the breakfast room
adjoining. Betty often “ did” the
dishes alone. She now proceeded
methodically to stack them as she
had been taught to do. Then she
prepared the soapy dishwater and
placed a second pan to rinse the
dishes in. All the time, however,
one ear was straying toward the
pleasant conversation nearby. Mother
was across the hall putting the
last stitches on a dress Betty was
I to wear on the morrow, and the little
girl was dawdling in order to
enjoy the chat Daddy was having
with the “ company.”
Suddenly. Betty breathed a prolonged,
“ Oh— ! ”
Daddy’s head appeared in the
kitchen doorway. “ Break something?”
he inquired.
“ The hot water d id !” explained
Betty replacing a tea kettle of hot
water on the stove.
The guests in the breakfast room
smiled at the explanation. But Betty
bravely held up a cracked tum bler.
“ Too bad,” said Daddy sympathetically.
“ I ’d better go and tell Mother.'*
Betty marched gravely out of the
kitchen.
“ I ’d give anything if my boy,
George, would own’ up when something
like that happens,” remarked
Cousin Harriet. “ I scold him and
scold him , but it doesn’t seem to
make any impression.”
“ H ’m,*’ said her husband, " it
makes him afraid to confess.’*
Betty, back in the kitchen, approached
the breakfast room door,
holding the cracked tumbler. She
smiled at her father. “ Mother says
I must be sure to have the rinsing
water cool enough to put my finger
in. But she says not to worry about
this particular glass, because it was
a cheap one.” Betty resumed her
dishwashing humming softly to herself.
“ Well, it’s a sort of habit, I think,’*
her father said in an undertone to
his relatives, “ this ‘fessing up,’ but
Betty’s mother never makes it hard
for a child to tell her anything. She
says confidence is the one thing she
wants from the children. And we
find that they themselves are as
regretful over a mistake or an accident
as we are. We simply talk it
over and sometimes, not too often,
use it as a basis for a future reminder
to avoid repetition.
Honesty Is Natural for Ted.
“ When we gave Ted his new bi-
1 cycle I told him to be careful where
he parked it—not to leave it long in
u nfam iliar surroundings. He was
pretty careful the first month. Then
he forgot one day and left his wheel
in a vacant lot down near the railroad
tracks, while he pitched an
impromptu ball game.”
“ And it was stolen?” inquired
Cousin Harriet.
“ No; when he went for it, apparently
it was all right. Then he discovered
about half a dozen of the
parts were gone!”
“ Well,” said Cousin Harriet’s husband,
“ I expect he d id n’t relish telling
y o u !’*
“ No,” said Ted’s father with a
laugh, “ he didn’t. He commenced,
though, by saying, ‘You were right,
Dad, about my bike.’ ”
“ It ’s expensive,” complained
Cousin Harriet, “ the things these
youngsters do; I would whip George
if he disobeyed me like th a t!”
Ted’s father shook his head.
“ That's out of date, Harriet. I said
to Ted, ‘W hat happened, Son?’ He
then told me just what had happened
and what was missing. Well, I told
. him it was his job to earn back those
• missing parts.
“ ‘I ’ve been thinking it over, D a d ,’
he said, 'so I asked Mrs. Clark,
down the street, if I could mow her
I lawn, and she said she would like to
! have her car cleaned. I t ’ll be every
two weeks. D a d !’ ”
“ To have to work for something,
like that, will make a man of h im ! ”
approved Cousin Harriet’s husband.
“ We must go.” Cousin Harriet
I arose.
Betty hurried from the kitchen and
soon returned. “ Mother wants you
to see my new dress!” she said.
Cousin Harriet looked around the
kitchen. It was unmistakably in order.
“ Your wife must take a lot of
time nnd trouble training the children.”
She sighed.
Betty’s father hesitated. How
much dared he say? “ Well, an
! ‘ounce of prevention—’ ” he ventured.
“ But after all, children are
people—they are seldom intentional
miscreants—that is if you treat them
as if you expected them to be responsible—
If you—well—take it for
granted, you know.”

Susan was a domestic help and
her middle name was inefficiency.
Her long-suffering employer decided,
reluctantly, to discharge her, and
the girl had asked for a written
character. For some time nothing
was heard but the scratch of the
pen; then her employer paused, as
ii in doubt.
“ Well, Susan,” she said, “ I ’ve
mentioned that you’re clean, honest,
and truthful. But how to explain
why I ’m parting with you,
without putting in something detrimental,
I really don’t know.”
“ Why, that’s just the thing,

Correct Fashion
Guppy—My wife is always complaining
that she has nothing to
wear.
Pometto—Great Scott, m a n ! Tell
her she’s right in the height of fashion
without knowing it.
IT IS intensely interesting to note
* the comradeship, the spirit of
mutual endeavor and co-operation
that exists these days between m erchantman,
designer and the college
girl as to the planning of a program
of clothes that must be practical
first of all, at the same time they
must date smartly for the varied
types of activities that crowd the
life of Miss Modern.
It was a happy inspiration that
moved merchandiser and style creator
to call into consultation groups
of typical college girls, to take these
young people into partnership, so to
speak, in their efforts to assemble
wardrobes of smart apparel that
would meet the demands of every
occasion in a thoroughly practical
sense as well as a highly fashioncorrect
way.
In the illustration we are showing
three apparel choices of a typical
college girl who considers these
clothes classics as indispensable for
her a lm a mater. To be sure they
simply represent the initial numbers
that lay the foundation of a well
organized wardrobe.
Centered in the picture Miss Collegiate
is properly attired in a twin
sweater set topping a circular plaid
skirt plus the inevitable commonsense
oxfords. And here’s something
about plaids to keep in mind,
you can't wear ’em too bright this
season, the more red in their color
scheme the better.
To the right in the picture this
fa ir co-ed is wearing a skirt and
sweater combination topped by a
classic water-proofed clan plaid coat
with gabardine lining. Her sports
hat of felt is a perfect college-girl
type. She wears the typical saddle
oxfords and wool ankle sox. Have
your sox initialed is fashion’s latest
message. You can know that the
coat here pictured will attend football
games this fall, which was in
the mind of the designer who styled
it with an idea for w arm th and comfort
as well as good “ looks.” This
coat is likewise the type that will
go to town often, will stand the test
of motoring and prove a friend indeed
throughout wind, rain, sunshine
and the vagaries of weather
that m ark autum n and winter days.
Miss College G irl's choice to wear
on a date with her best beau is a
trim , very sm art, very practical
outfit in black as illustrated to the
left in the group. Her crepe frock
has the pinched-in waistline such as
fashion demands this season; also
the new back fullness. In her trunk
she has tucked away one of the new
detachable bustle bows which she
wears now and then to add an extra
note of chic to her frock. Her felt
beret (sm all, it won’t slip out of
pose in dancing) has the new forward
tilt and she brightens the
whole with a flamboyant necklace
and matching bracelet set in eyethrilling
colored stones.
Not that choice must be restricted
to a black dress with massive gold
and colorful stone-set jewelry for
keeping dress-up dates. To be sure
the big idea is black for your
autum n “ first,” but the gorgeous
colors on the way are simply breathtaking.
The new wool dresses and
the very chic and fetching velveteen
dresses make striking color their
theme.

Jeweled Buttons
Elegance is the keynote to fashions
this fall and winter. Feminine
whims and fancies add infinite
charm to the mode. Seeing that
we have gone back to the gay nineties
for much of our inspiration it
was inevitable that the vogue for
big glittering jeweled buttons should
be revived. And here they are
glorifying the bolero suit of chartreuse
wool crepe as here pictured.
The jeweled buttons of amethyst

ornament.

Latest Lace Tint
G l i d e r white, which has a pale

favorite colors for evening gowns in
the most recent Paris showings,
w’hile Molyneux showed a vivid
bright shade of blue. Molyneux
not only did the new pencil-slim
silhouette in lace, but made quite
a sensation with his double-swing
skirts for dance frocks, which were
often ankle length. One of these
in black lace had three flounces at
the hem, with a deep square decolletage
at the back edged with three
ruffles. Another gown in the fullskirted
group was in black net with
a lace top.
In a gown by Patou with long,
slim lines, fullness in the back was
achieved by means of godets, and
the effect was quite sophisticated in
lace over a silver princess slip.

Elegance Is Word
For New Handbags
Handsome is the word for the new
handbags. Even the bags carried
with practical daytime costumes
will sound a note of elegance in
their general finish and fine mountings.
Emphasis is on suede bags in
interesting shapes and expert workmanship.
The more formal types announce
revival of ornate frames, and many
trim m ing touches in way of braiding
and embroidery.
Evening bags are all aglitter with
sequin handcraft, bead embroidery
and other “ whimsies’* that tune to
a song of elegance that will be heard
throughdut the winter social season.

New life for an old rocker
'T 'H E R E were rocking chairs
* hanging from the ceiling of a
certain second-hand furniture
store. “ Nobody wants them any
m ore,” mourned the dealer. “ I ’d
sell any one you see for 50 cents.”
The little bride with me promptly
chose one. Perhaps she would
paint it for the porch.
What she actually did is shown
here in the sketch. The result was
the small but comfortable, modern
looking chair at the upper left.
The bride raided mother’s attic
for two things that went into the
m aking of this chair. One was an
old quilt that she used to pad the
back. The other was feathers
from an old bolster w'hich were
used to stuff a seat cushion tightly
so that it would raise the seat
which had been lowered by removing
the rockers. Cotton basted
to muslin could have been used
for the back padding and a cotton
substitute for the cushion filling.

Spears contains 32 other useful

clearly illustrated. You
will be delighted with it. The
price is only 10 cents postpaid.
