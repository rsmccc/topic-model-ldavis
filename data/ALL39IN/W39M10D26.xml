The Red Cross Roll Call committee
for Wittenberg and this vicinity, headed
by Mr. and Mrs. Melvin Schlytter,
is looking forward to the time when
the greatest humanitarian drive in
history gets under way on Saturday,
November 11, the annual Red Cross
Roll Call.
Last week a group of county Roll
Call leaders attended a state conference
at Madison. They reported that
the proceedings were more than interesting
and will be of great benefit in
putting the 1939 Red Cross Roll Call
into the history books as the most successful
Wittenberg has ever staged.
Mrs. Walter Schmidt, county Roll
Call chairman, issued a speeial set of
instructions to community leaders, informing
them that the Roll Call is
purely a voluntary venture. ' I f a person
is unable to give,’ Mrs. Schmidt
said, it will be no personal reflection
on them, but if they are able to give,
they will have that personal satisfaction
that comes only from the true
spirit of benevolence.
“ Red Cross takes much of the burden
of social relief off the hands of the
government,” Mrs. Schmidt pointed
out. “ A common argument against
the Red Cross Roll Call is that worn
out statement, “let the government
take care of the needy.”
In event of a major disaster,
thousands left homeless in the wake of
a flood or tornado, the Red Cross is
always on the scene performing great
humanitarian acts. This is one angle
of relief work that would not only
work hardship on the unfortunate victims,
but probably be left undone if it
were not for the Red Cross.
“ Disaster could hit Wittenberg just
as easy as anywhere,” Mrs. Schmidt
pointed out, “and if that tjme ever
comes, Red Cross will be ready.”

One Thousand Per Cent in 1939
S oftball Conference
The game Monday. October 23, con
eluded the softball conference of 1939,
and what a wonderful finish it was
We licked Tigerton, the strongest
team in the league, five to ten. Dur
ing the fifth inning it was anybody’s
game until Derrow hit a homer. Dur
ing the same inning Harold Bessette
our catcher, was knocked out by i
foul ball.
That game gave us a perfect record
of a thousand per cent. We started
with Tigerton and made a clean sweep
of all the teams in the league. Our
winning the conference was due main
ly to the cooperation of all our men
and the enthusiasm which they showed
when they played. The good coach
ing of Mr. Torbenson helped a lot
toward the winning of the conference
We owe a lot to Ida Larson who was
always ready to be of service in taking
the boys to the g am o in her car.

MANY WIL D RUMORS ABOUT
REPUTED $175,000 MANSION
Elderly Woman Building Huge
Residence East of Gresham
By DON HICKOK
Shawano, Wis., in Antigo Journal.
You drive along a town road parallel
to and just north of the Red river,
until you come to a huge “Keep Out”
sign. Then you turn left, past the
sign, and drive until a fellow yells,
“ Hey. didn’t you see that sig n?” Then
you are at the site of a construction
that has caused more rumors than any
other single thing in Shawano county
for some time.
The site is on the Red river, about
three miles east of Gresham, and that
is where a wealthy, elderly woman is
building a residence reputed to cost
$175,000, in an effort to secure “peace
and privacy” for herself and a semiinvalid
daughter.
Reportedly, the residence itself will
cost an estimated $140,000, and landscaping
will add the additional capital.
Reportedly, the residence will include
over 40 rooms and 11 baths— one bath
for each bedroom excepting the ser
vants’ quarters, which will occupy
seven rooms on the third floor.
Actually the basement— a basement
into which an auto can be driven—and
the first floor have already been built,
of structural steel and concrete. A
completely fire-proof construction,
even to the unpractical eye. Before
you are chased out, it may be possible
to go to the south side of the building
and view the ravine and Freboume
Falls’ scene, that makes the land, to
the almost legendary owner, "Worth
such a residence.
But in approaching the building
from the ‘Keep Out* sign in, you will
notice that the road was filled in to
make what is practically a causeway
through a swamp. You will notice
that the timber, such as it is, is mainly
second-growth that will have to be
removed for any sort of landscaping
at all.
You have heard, up to now, that the
building will be used for almost every
purpose, from a Volksbund headquartters
to a sanitarium for the sick. It is
impossible, in the village of Gresham
or the city of Shawano, to continue
a conversation for any length of time
without eventually turning to that
“ Freebourne Falls mansion.”
The contractor from Green Bay, *
Shawano architect, and Gordon Feld
hausen. Green Bay associate architect,
all maintain that they have instruc
tions that no information, not even the
name of the owner, shall be given out
to the general public.
An entirely innocent and inadvertent
source disclosed that the owner is
wealthy widow who has an estate in
New Rochelle in New York state, and
another in a Chicago suburb; that she
has a dfuighter in an invalid condition
who will benefit by the peace and
quiet.
One report, made known in Gresham
some time ago. is that all unemployed
men in the town of Herman shall be
employed when ever possible, under
the contract. From that time on. all
the unemployed men who actually
sought work took dinner pails each
day and camped at the site, day after
'lav, until it was apparent that no
help would be employed that day.
Many of them eventually did get tem
porary work, but when the steel and
concrete work reached the skilled
stage, only skilled help was employed
and at this writing, only about 25 men
i are at work.
Until more definite information is
forthcoming— if it is at all—Shawano
county will continue to speculate
about the residence. In certain “Gold
Coasts” such a building would cause
no comment at all, but in Shawano
county, where such a building is un
heard of, $200,000 is just that, and
bound to cause comment.
From time to time, visitors tell of
going through the site for a complete
survey of the construction as perform
ed up to now. Such inspections, however,
were apparently made when the
contractor and his chief satellites were
not there—and none of them by the
persona-non-grata members of the
prep*. Meanwhile. Shawano county
mtinues to speculate.

E U R O P E :
War of D ip lom acy
Biggest news on the diplomatic
front was wishful thinking in London
and Paris to the efTect that
Italy was swinging away from Berlin
to form a strong Balkan peace
bloc, meanwhile adopting a policy
of “ benevolent neutrality” toward
the allies. There were good reasons
for such a move because Italy
has strong trade interests in the
Balkans, where Russia is trying to
win an upper hand.
Backing the rumor, Ita lia n newspapers
continued heaping insults on
Communism. P artially spiking it,
however, was authoritative Editor
Virgina Gayda, wrhose II Giornale
D'Italia termed P rim e Minister
Cham berlain’s refusal to call off the
war “ a dangerous no.”
Meanwhile Germany continued
last-minute efforts to avert war, having
waited until the final heartbreaking
moment in the hope that
Prime Minister Chamberlain would
capitulate. U. S. aid, asked unofficially,
was not forthcoming. Such
desperate efforts could only mean
that Germany had been surprised,
perhaps to her ultimate ruin, by allied
determination. For recourse
Der Fuehrer redoubled his efforts to
cement trade relations wuth Russia,
now busy elsewhere after getting all
she wanted from Germany. Biggest
question: Now that the allies
had shunned peace, where was the
“ co-operation” Germany and Russia
had threatened only two weeks before?
(Proclaiming Armistice day, President
Roosevelt re ine d Europe's intervention
hopes by asking Americans to look for•
unrd to “a time when a just nnd enduring
peace shall be established.")
W ar on L a n d A- in Air
On the western front 65 German
divisions were massed from the sea
to the Rhine. Significantly, 30 of
them stood opposite Holland and
Belgium, satisfying the experts that

tactics. Intensified German pressure
was not long in coming. In a
single day it drove the French back
to their own soil on a four-mile
front in the Moselle valley, but at
a cost of 500 to 1.000 casualties and
the loss of 20 tanks.
But bigger news came from the
air. Berlin’s first bombing scare
arrived one evening as Nazi housewives
were meditating on lard sandwiches
for next morning's breakfast
(included in the week's suggested
ration menu). Twenty thousand
feet up, anti-aircraft artillerymen
spotted a “ raider.” Shot down in
the panic, the plane turned out to be
a lost German bomber.
Britain had a genuine scare next
day. Fourteen German bombers in vaded
English soil for the first time.
Their objective: The huge naval
base and bridge at Firth of Forth,
near Edinburgh, Sc otland. When the
melee was over Britain counted 52
killed or wounded, and slight d am age
to one cruiser. Four Nazi bombers
had been brought down.
If ar at Spa
In 1651 B ritain’s fugitive King
Charles II hid in an oak tree at
Boscobel, Shropshire, after the battle
of Worcester. A few years later
proud Britons named a warship after
their revered ‘‘royal oak.” The
ship was promptly sunk by the
Dutch in 1667. Ten more "R o y al
O aks” carried the ill omen, the last
going into action at Ju tland less
than a month after being com m issioned.
Weathering this battle, she
was damaged at Valencia in 1937.
Last year the $10,000,000 craft was
“ sunk” in a British film labeled
“ Torpedoed.” This month the Royal
Oak was really torpedoed and sunk,
carrying to the bottom her ill omen
and some 785 men.
This wras only one part of a weekend’s
terrific warfare at sea. Berlin
claimed the same submarine which
sank the Royal Oak also damaged
Britain's battle cruiser Repulse, but
the adm iralty said it couldn't be
bothered “ denying all these reports.”
Six other British and French
freighters went to Davy Jones’ locker
within three days, but on Friday
the Thirteenth the British navy sank
three U-boats.
At Rome, the official paper Vie
dell' Art a “ revealed” an ambitious
Nazi scheme to blow B rita in’s navy
off the sea by allotting 200 planes
to bomb each warship. Fireside
fighters of the long-theorized war of
airship vs. warship agreed the Nazis
had made a good start.
Russian E ducation
In the U. S., John Public discovered
for the first time that Soviet
Russia had a president. To Michael
Kalinin, who i» Dictator J o .^ f
Stalin's No. 1 puppet, Franklin
Roosevelt expressed a hope for continued
peaceful Russian-Finnish relations.
Many another nation was
also learning about Soviet Russia, a
20-year-old bear which has just begun
to feel its strength:
Scandinavia. Having won domination
of the Baltic states, Lithuania,
Estonia and Latvia, the Soviet
turned to Finland and demanded
military-naval bases. A Finn named

It was expected the Finns would surrender
a few islands, but not the
strategic Aalands which Russia covets.
Baltic. Estonia’s Gen. Johan Lai*
doner assured the people their n a tion
was still free, but there were
signs to the contrary. Among them:
The premier resigned and a new
cabinet was established. Meanwhile
Lithuania, which received a
better break from Moscow than either
Latvia or Estonia (winning rule
over the former Polish city of Wilno),
decided to demand that Germ
any grant her extra - territorial
rights in the harbor of Memel, which
Adolf Hitler seized last spring. The
Lithuanians hoped Russia would
back their request.
Balkans. Hungary feared that
Russia’s Baltic conquest would be
followed by demands for Ruthenia,
the Ukrainian province seized from
Czecho-Slovakia early this year. R u m
an ia had s im ilar worries over
Bessarabia, the petroleum-rich area
she took from Russia after the World
war. Moreover. R um an ia heard reports
that Russia might try to settle
Balkan troubles at her expense,
taking both Bessarabia and Ruthenia,
and placating the Hungarians
and Bulgarians by giving each a
s^ce of land they lost to R um ania
after the last war.
This, it was reliably stated, held
a top place among demands Russia
tried to force down the throat of
Turkey's Foreign Minister Sukro
Saracoglu. Acting as mediator for
all Balkan states, Saracoglu had reportedly
refused not only to sell R u mania
short, but also to recogn>ze
Russia's Polish grab, create a neutral
Balkan bloc under German-Russian
domination, or break Turkey’s
alliance with Britain and France.
Russian troops were masred on
her borders, but the Turks stood so
firm that many a diplomat felt she
held the balance of European power.
Her position: Turkey would stay
neutral if the allies fought Russia,
but she would join the allies if Italy
took sides with Germany. With
2.000,000 troops under arms, controlling
the strategic Dardenelles
and holding considerable influence
over other Balkan states, the Turks
were not to be slighted.

C O N G R E S S :
Peace?
Neutrality was making a bum this
month out of many an otherwise
efficient statesman. Each day the
low'er house of congress assembled
half-heartedly, listened to a few
pointless speeches and went its way
to Washington’s cocktail rooms and
bars. There was nothing else to do
until the senate finished wrangling
with neutrality and sent the bill
over. Meanwhile that happy day
was drawing nearer.
Senators passed the 300.000-w’ord
m ark in their debate on isolationism
vs. casU-and-carry. Though they
were still going strong, compromise
was in the air to replace the prem
ature victory song of embargo re-
| pealists. Some of the incentive came
j from outside, such as Col. Charles
| A. Lindbergh’s second radio speech
| in which he plumped for retention
! of the arms embargo. Howard Cooni
ley, president of the National Association
of Manufacturers, pointed
out that industry is opposed to war
and realizes the falseness of war
profits. This gave North Dakota’s
Sen. Gerald P. ( “ Neutrality” ) Nye
a new talking point.
Thus far, isolationist propaganda
has tried to convince the nation
that cash-and-carry neutrality will
get America into war. But the cam paign
failed to je ll, so isolationists
found a more potent weapon by
d ram atizing the post-war depression
that will inevitably follow if U. S.
industry expands to serve warring
Europe. Sa:d Mr. Nye with pretty
fair logic: “ I dare the senate to find
10 (of 50 leading industrialists) who
will wish to repeat the experience
of the last wrar boom.”

Nye returned to the old song that
administration neutrality proposals
are a “ step” toward war, he found
himself confronted for the first time
with Nebraska’s 78-year-old Sen.

(Consolidated Feature*— WNU S erv le t.)
W A SHINGTON.—T hurman W. A rnold,
and his trust-busting proclivities,
are a problem not only for
business men worried about what to
do in the war emergency, but to
certain other officials of the government.
The whole question revolves
around the fixing of prices.
The government as a w-hole, from
President Roosevelt down, is determined*
that there shall not be
profiteering, either at the expense
of the belligerents or of the Am erican
consumers. There is no disagreement
about that, and, to be
fa ir about it, there is no important
dissent by most of the m an ufacturers
and retailers represented in
Washington through their trade
groups. •
The business men say that they
cannot control rise in cost of the
raw materials, or of labor, but they
have no desire to push prices higher
than these two elements of expense
require. They are remembering the
deflation that foliow’ed the last war.
B ut when it comes to how to prevent
unreasonable advances in cost.
Old Man Worry walks in the door.
There are two obvious ways to
accomplish it. One would be by government
price fixing, as was done,
in part, by the Lever act in the last
war. Chief objection to this, strangely
enough, comes not from the business
m en involved, though they
don’t like government price fixing,
but from the government. Few on
the government side who rem em ber
how the Lever act worked last
tim e would be willing to risk it
again.
W o u l d P e r m it B u sine ss to
R e a c h P r ic e A g re em e n ts
The other solution would be to perm
it business itself to reach price
agreements in its various lines. That
appeals to the business men, naturally.
It also appeals to some of the
adm inistration executives, especially
in the department of commerce.
B ut not to Mr. Arnold.
In fact, the department of justice
is waving the big stick on anti-trust
prosecutions as never before, threatening
to prosecute all and sundry.
Arnold gets a lot of publicity for
his speeches and his gestures
against “ combinations in restraint
of trade.** There is perfectly good
legal precedent in high court decisions
that it is ju st as contrary to
the letter and spirit of the anti-trust
laws for competitors to agree to reduce
prices as it is for them to
agree to raise prices.
There is more logic in this, incidentally,
than sounds possible if one
is thinking only about the problem
which now confronts the government
—the prevention of profiteering. But
when the law was framed its designers
also had another practice in
m ind which was, at that time, very
much in the public m ind with regard
to the alleged practices of the
wicked monopolies.
The problem remains, however,
how to regulate without anyone doing
the regulating, and especially
not the folks regulated!
U n it e d S tate s F a c in g
B ig D e c lin e i n E x p o r ts
O ur European competitors for
South Am erican trade have left
Am erican manufacturers a market
crying for wares, but without much
of the wherewithal to pay for them.
And the European m arke t for many
of our products has dried up because
of the war.
Take the automobile makers, for
example. They find that their m a rket
in Scandinavia, which was pretty
good, has disappeared, to all
practical purposes, because of the
shortage of gasoline. Rigorous restrictions
on the use of gasoline
have played havoc with practically
every corner of Europe, with Australia,
South Africa and many other
parts of the world. It is not a question
of world shortage of gasoline, or
of war demands for this precious
fluid. It is purely, so far, a question
of ships to carry the gasoline to
would-be purchasers.
The worst phase of this is that
there is no silver lining to the cloud.
There is no prospect of the world
having enough shipping again until
after the war is over, and perhaps
for some little time after that. Ships
are being destroyed at a prodigious
rate.
Britain hopes to surmount this d ifficulty
by convoys, but it is a real
optimist who figures that there will
be convoys to get gasoline to Sweden.
Norway and Denmark. It would
not suit the purposes of the British-
French high command to have an
ample supply of gasoline so close to
Germany anyhow. Some of it might
trick'e through in response to Germ
an demands.
Besides, there is real fear, though
the submarine extermination battle
may go well, that bombing planes
will also be a menace to shipping,
neutral as well as vessels flying belligerent
flags.
So the Am erican auto makers are
figuring on foregoing all foreign
markets where the trouble with selling
new cars is that there is nothing
to put into their gas tanks.
S o u t h A m e r ic a Is A ls o
A D is c o u r a g in g M a r k e t
But that is only part of the bad
export picture for the motor companies.
There is no gasoline shortage
in South America. At any rate
it w’ould be comparatively easy to
supply any of the South American
countries with oil. Tugs and barges
could do the trick if necessary. But
South America is almost as discouraging
a m arket at the moment
as Europe.
The trouble there is exchange.
Most of the countries south of the
Rio Grande were caught by the outbreak
of the w ar w'ith a lot of bad
debts from Germ any. The Nazis
had been taking their exports, in
considerable volume, paying for
them with blocked m arks—marks
which could be spent only in Germany.
It is not just a question of losing
the money, temporarily or permanently.
One has to see why Latin
Am erica was willing to indulge in
this form of barter to realize how
serious it is now. The reason was
that the countries to the south of us
did not have the cash to pay for
goods they were buying from Germ
any. They had to pay for them
with exports. The United States was
just as good a place for them to
buy, if they had had the money. But
they d id n ’t, and their credit in this
country was very poor because of
those defaulted bonds and their
own restrictions on exchange.
Now they are worse off than they
were before, having parted with
huge amounts of exports for which
they have received no payment,
their no rm al export markets cut off
so fa r as central Europe is concerned,
B ritain buying only necessities.
Then there is great difficulty
in increasing exports to the United
States to pay for what they*want.
An increase of United States im ports
of Latin-American products
would solve the problem.
L it t l e A t t e n t io n Is G iv e n
T o P r o b le m o f Im p o r t s
So much attention is being given
to the alleged war possibilities of the
neutrality battle in the senate, and
so much oratory is centered on the
export of arms, that very little attention
is being given to imports.
Yet imports are of the essence so
far as American trade and American
business are concerned.
Before the first World war the
United States exported more than
she imported. That was sound, then,
because the United States actually
owed money, and the excess of exports
over imports paid the interest
on that debt. (This was mostly in
the form of foreign holdings of United
States stocks and bonds, but it
works out the same way.)
Today the world owes the United
States, even if one eliminates the
debts that we suspect will never be
paid. So the United States, to m a in tain
a sound equilibrium, should im port
a little more than it exports,
so that the foreigners can pay us
the interest, at least, on the debt
they owe us.
That is part of the picture. The
idea of building up a United States
m erchant m arine is another part.
Many people under the pressure of
more exciting events regard these
two as academic. But there is a
third phase. How are we going to
get imports that we actually need
brought to us.
By its mandatory provisions preventing
American ships from carrying
cargo to belligerents, the pending
bill virtually hands over to foreign
shipping all transport to French
and British territory. This means
not only exports but imports as well.

T r a d in g W i t h B r it is h P o rts
Curiously enough, the original
agreement provided that British
ships should haul half the cotton
and half the rubber. This was
changed, later, at the request of the
British, so that now the agreement
provides that all the cotton is to be
hauled in British ships, and all the
rubber in United States bottoms.
But the neutrality act would bar
United States ships from trading
with the British ports in the East
from which the rubber is exported!
Moreover, the bill has plenty of
teeth, if no change is made to recog-
| nize these practical conditions. For
I instance, an American ship stopping
at Singapore for rubber, or Sidney
for wool, would make her owners
liable to a fine of $50,000, not to mention
imprisonment for up to five
years!
The tragic part of it all is that in
recent years, after decades of stupid
bungling and terrific waste of
money and effort, the United States
had really been building up a good
merchant marine. Moreover, many
additional ships are under construction
or contract. Regardless of how
trade with L atin America is developed
— remembering that of
course all British and French possessions
in that part of the world
would be barred to our ships by
this bill if enacted in its present
form—it w ill not be sufficient to
I m aintain the present, and building
| United States merchant marine if
j our ships are to be barred from the
rest of the world.

C H A P T E R V II—Continued
When Lynn glanced at Rundhia
again, he had his back to the iron
chest and he was staring at her,
dark-eyed, not smiling—noticeably
not. Lynn accepted the unspoken
challenge:
“ I am sorry I let you kiss me this
morning. I shouldn’t have. It wasn’t
fair. It may have given you a
wrong impression.'*
'T h e correct one being—”
“ Oh, I was just being mischievous.
It meant nothing.”
“ N o?”
Rundhia eyed her for several seconds
without speaking. She d idn’t
feel afraid of him , but every fiber
in her being was aware of crisis.
Sim ulating calmness that she did
not feel, she almost unconsciously
moved the tennis racket from one
hand to the other.
“ Careful with that,” he advised.
“ Put it down. You might break
something. Come over here and see
the emeralds.’*
She did not put down the tennis
racket. That would have been obedience.
She was obeying no one. It
was not obedience that made her
walk toward h im around the overloaded
table. She was walking
straight into danger. She didn’t deceive
herself about that for a moment.
Neither did Rundhia try to
deceive her. Passion, confident and
self-avowed, glowered in his splendid
eyes. They were more arresting
than the diamonds in the glass
case. He looked bold, experienced,
and m uch more masculinely beautiful
than any human being she had
ever met. She could feel her heart
pounding. And she felt as sure of
herself as if she were about toplunge
into a warm inviting sea.
She d id n ’t hesitate.
“ Lynn, I love you!'*
“ Weren’t you going to show me
the emeralds?”
Strange, how such tactics checked
h im . He behaved as he did in the
garden the previous night when she
mentioned the British Resident and
Norwood. It seemed to make him
nervous—to remind him of some insufficiency
within himself. He
glanced past her, at the eyehole in.
the door, then turned and opened
the iron chest. He took out two
handfuls of huge emeralds.
“ Thousands,” she said, “ I suppose,
are like me. What is it about
precious stones that—”
“ Thrills you? Sensuous things,
aren’t they? Feel their magic! Press
them against your face! E n jtv
them! One of these days they’ll be
mine. These emeralds are not State
property. Lynn! Love me and I ’ll
give them to y o u !”
“ Thank you. I don’t want them .”
“ Maharanee Lynn of K adur! How
would that be? Lynn—”
He moved both arm s toward her.
She poured back the emeralds into
his hands. He had to take them,
or they would have crashed to the
tiled floor and that might have
brought in the guard. Rundhia
dumped them back into the chest.
Lynn spoke before he could:
“ Show me the diamonds. Captain
Norwood—” Rundhia flinched. Lynn
noticed it—“ wouldn’t show me those
that he has.”
Again she had sent R u n d h ia’s
thought off on a tangent. His eyes
weren’t steady any longer. Lynn
followed up:
“ They looked like big ones, but
he’s carelessewith them. I f I had n’t
noticed them fall he might have lost
them .”
“ D iam onds?” said Rundhia. “ In
Norwood's pocket? When?”
“ This morning He let them fall
while he was talking to me.”
She was already sorry she had
said it. R u nd h ia’s eyes darkened
with what looked like cunning. Lynn
felt safer. Rundhia was running
wild along a new line, for the moment.
But Lynn felt guilty. She
should not have defended herself at
Norwood’s cost. She hadn’t meant
to. But she guessed now that she
had. It made her self-contemptuous
and angry.
“ Rundhia, what are you thinking
•b o u t? ”
“ You! You o n ly !’* His eyes sought
hers again. “ To hell with Norwood!
Lynn beluved, beautiful, glorious
Lynn laughed. “ Ask Aunty H arding
what I am ! She saw u s !”
“ Dam n her, what do we care?”
“ Captain Norwood also saw us.”
“ Any of his business?” Rundhia
checked again. His eyes darkened.
“ Look here, Lynn, I don’t like to
tell tales about people—”
“ Why do it then?”
“ You ought to know this. Norwood
has been talking .”
“ About m e ? ”
“ Yes. While he was waiting to
enter the audience room just now
he asked a palace official where you
slept last night.”
“ I don’t believe it.”
“ The official told me.”
“ Captain Norwood never would do
such a thing.”
“ Don’t you know he’s a spy for the
British Intelligence? Such fellows
havent a scruple. Do you think I
would lie to you?”
“ Yes! I know you would! Let’s go
now, Rundhia. I ’ve seen enough. I
want to talk to the Maharanee.”
“ Merciless! You want to tantalize
me? I ’m already m ad about you!
Mad, I tell you! Lynn, do you be-
“ Lynn, Lynn darling, 1 am too
ashamed to tell you how I feel. Has
he hurt you? Are you all right? I
have told h im I will neither pay his
debts nor speak to h im again until
he has your full forgiveness.”
The Resident decided to take
hatred by the horns.
lieve this love that sweeps me like a
storm can’t conquer you? Do you
suppose you can fire m y veins, torture
my heart—and not burn in the
same ecstasy? I said burn! You are
as passionate as I am ! You are no
cold beauty. Come here.”
She was against the table. He
was pushing her backward. Things
were falling off the table. He was
kissing her. His face was buried in
her hair. She freed her right a r m -
groped—seized the tennis racket and
struck h im hard in the face with its
edge. Blood. Blood on her frock.
Lots of it. Rundhia let go then. He
found his handkerchief and held it
to his face. Blood.
Lynn gasped, breathless: “ What
have I done?”
He didn’t answer. With the handkerchief
to his face he turned away
from her.
“ R u ndhia,” she said, “ I wouldn't
have hurt you for worlds.”
“ You have broken my heart,” he
answered.
“ R u n d h ia !”
It was the Maharanee’s voice. The
great teak door had swung open.
The Maharanee stood in the doorway,
staring, with the guards behind
her. She turned and dismissed the
guards.
“ Rundhia, what have you been doing?
There is blood on Lynn’s frock!
Lynn! Darling, what has he done
to you?”
“ No h a rm ,” Lynn answered. She
turned to hide the blood and the rip
in her frock.
The Maharanee spoke to Rundhia,
in his own language, vehemently,
for about a minute. She was at no
loss for words. She let him have it
with the governed directed anger
that cuts like a whip. Then, in E nglish.
for Lynn’s benefit:
“ Don’t play for sympathy! That is
no more than one of your usual
nose-bleeds! Let your doctor attend
to it. G o !”
Rundhia strode from the room.
The Maharanee came and p ul ber
arm around Lvnn:
CH A P T E R V III
Norwood could almost physically
feel those diamonds in his tunic
pocket. He should have asked
Lynn not to mention them. He knew
that. It was too late to turn back.
And besides, she was having a row
with her aunt and it wouldn’t be
cricket to butt in. He wished he
hadn’t seen Lynn kiss Rundhia.
There were two things that Norwood
ached to do that minute. One was
to punch Rundhia. The other was
to go to the temple and throw those
diamonds at the high priest.
But that was just the kind of
thing that Norwood could be trusted
not to do. He knew exactly what he
should do. But the M aharajah and
his court were waiting to give him
official audience. He glanced at his
watch. There remained only five
minutes in which to reach the palace
in time for the appointment, so
he mounted his horse at the gate
and rode up the long drive to the
front door, where he arrived exactly
on the minute. The sais wiped the
dust from his boots and he strode up
the palace steps, expecting to get
away within fifteen minutes. But
time, in India, is one of lethargy’s
dimensions.
As a captain, Norwood wasn’t entitled
to be received from the
throne, so the M aharajah sat on a
gilded chair at one side of the room,
with officials of only second-grade
importance on smaller chairs to
right and left. The chamberlain
stood and read aloud from the instruction
for the reception of British
captains:
“ His Highness now enquires after
the visitor's health . . . The visitor
responds . . . His Highness is pleased
to welcome him . . . His Highness
begs him to be seated . . . The visitor
sits . . . His Highness . . .”
He was met and importunately
detained by the M a h a raja h ’s m inister
of state and four other im portant
members of the Council.
Silently cursing his luck, he did
his best to escape. But servile
wretches in silken liveries flung open
the door of an anteroom.
“ Look here, Diwan sahib, I ’d be
awfully glad to talk things over with
you now, but I have urgent business
at the Residency.”
“ Oh, but Captain Norwood, we
could phone the Residency.”
“ That wouldn’t help. I ’m afraid.
I ’m not expected there. I need the
Resident’s advice.”
“ Ah, but Captain Norwood, is not
our need greater? Documents, arguments.
some witnesses, are ready
now! His Highness has postponed
important business to be present. He
is waiting in the Council room.
This boundary dispute is so urgent
and its implications so important,
that we feel our importunity is
justified. We beg you.”
“ Oh, well.”
Norwood could almost feel those
diamonds, burning him through the
lining of his tunic pocket. Tension
crept into his normally easy m anner.
The ministers detected it. Tension
became mutual.
“ I hope you’ll bear in mind I ’m
in a hurry.”
Two cars started from R und h ia’s
palace door within two minutes of
each other. Having brought Rund
h ia’s nose-bleed under control, the
Bengali doctor drove away first, in
the smaller car, for a professional
call on Aunty Harding. If he had
been going to his own execution, he
might have looked equally comfortless.
Perhaps he dreaded Aunty
H arding’s temper, perhaps something
else.
Rundhia, a moment or two later,
climbed into the new Rolls-Royca
and laid his head back on the cushions,
to prevent the nose-bleed from
recurring. He was still bleeding
slightly. He kept dabbing with a
handkerchief.
“ The British Residency!”
The Russian chauffeur drove like
fury, but Rundhia made h im slow
down near the Residency gate.
Though he affected to despise all
ceremonial, Rundhia took cynical
pleasure in m aking sure they should
turn out the guard. He had phoned
to say he was coming, so he was
shown into the dim library, where
the shades were drawn against the
brazen sunlight, and the Resident
didn’t keep h im waiting more than a
couple of minutes.
“ How are you, Rundhia. How is
the new Rolls-Royce behaving?”
Rundhia dabbed at his nose with
the handkerchief. “ The car is quite
well, thank you. How are you?”
They sat in armchairs eyeing each
other in comfortless silence for nearly
a minute. The Resident, who was
feeling drowsy, tried to look firm,
but fatherly and cordial. Rundhia
was very good indeed at looking insolent
without giving actual grounds
for offense. He did his best, until
the Resident decided to take hatred
by the horns:
“ Of course, I ’ve no inkling of the
reason for this unexpected visit,
Rundhia. However, I ’m glad you
came. There are no witnesses, and,
of course, this is off the record. I
am taking the opportunity to remind
you. once more, privately, that
our treaty with this otherwise independent
State of Kadur gives to j
His Majesty’s Indian Government
the right to veto the succession to ,
the throne of any heir in whom His ;
British M ajesty’s advisers may lack
sufficient confidence.”
“ I have always been civil to you. |
But you couldn’t like me, even if
you tried, could you!” Rundhia retorted.
“ I take exception to that,” said
the Resident. “ I have my duty to
consider, not m y personal likes and
dislikes. As a matter of actual fact,
I could easily like you, if you would
give me the opportunity. When you
choose, you can be charming, and
you are very intelligent. But on
several occasions 1 have deplored
your conduct and have had to speak
to you about it. You have recently
returned from Delhi. Rumors
reached me. Without revealing confidences,
I may say they were more
than rumors. There are limits beyond
which an heir to a throne
should not trespass in quest of
amusement—or for any other reason.
I remind you that your cousin
Jodha comes of age this week.’’
“ Jodha is such a crock he couldn’t
cut up if he tried,” said Rundhia.
“One leg in the grave. The other’s
rotten. Why drag h im in? He’ll be
dead soon.”
“ F ailing acceptable heirs, the
throne of Kadur can be escheated.
I am warning you, R u n d h ia .”
“ Thanks! 1 have heard you. Now
it’s my turn and I ’ll warn you. It ’s
what I came for. Who is this Captain
Norwood? I notice you didn’t
present him at the palace. He came
alone. Why? Are you keeping your
hands off? Why does he carry d iamonds
in his tunic pocket? Why is
he nervous when someone happens
to see them? Is he one of your B ritish
gentlemen who never-never under
any circumstances, never take
a bribe? From a priest, for instance
—to report, according to his honorable
conscience, in the priests’ fa vor

If all the national, provincial and
com m unal roads in Italy and in its
empire were laid end to end they
would circle around the world almost
five times.
The highways in Italy, Ethiopia,
Lybia and the various island possessions
total more than 110,000
miles. A ll of this mileage represents
modern, wide, surfaced
roads.
In Italy there are 105,000 miles of
highways. Of this total 12,000 miles
are national highways and the rest
provincial and c om m u ral roads.
There are 2,000 miles .of completed
roads in Ethiopia and another 1,000
miles will be ready for use within
the next 12 months. In Lybia there
are approximately 2,000 miles of
roads, 1,250 miles of which skirt the
seafront, extending from the Tunisian
to the Egyptian frontiers.
Italy claims that its roads are the
highest, the most beautiful and the
most fascinating in Europe. The
highest road climbs over the Stelvio
*ito Switzerland. At its highest
point it reaches an altitude of 9,050
feet above set level. The most
beautiful, according to Italian
claims, is the winding, picturesque
road in the pastel-tinted Dolomites.
The most fascinating is the Gardesana,
w"hich runs along the west
i side oi Lake Garda it i* a marvel
of engineering, as most of its length
is carved out of solid stone mountains
and long stretches run through
galleries.
Italy has eight superhighways
(autostrades), reserved exclusively
for high-speed motor traflic. They
pass through some of the most beautiful
regions in Italy and form d irect
connecting links between
places of artistic and historical interest.
Work of keeping Ita ly ’s
highways up to date has been entrusted
to the autonomous road
board. Through its labors the
greater part of the Italian road
system has boen reorganized.
The inconveniences of the old
thoroughfares have been reduced.
Dirt roads, which meant mud in
rain and dust in dry weather, have
disappeared, and road surfaces asphalted
and paved. Dangerous
curves and steep gradings have
been eliminated. Trees and fences
alongside roads have been painted
with white bands to aid nig ht driving.

Wash crystals away from side of

slowly during latter part of period
so that syrup will not darken. Remove
from flame and set saucepan
into boiling water. Note: A double
boiler may be used for this. Add
coloring and flavoring and stir just
enough to mix well.
Holding apple by skewer, plunge
it into hot syrup. Draw it out quickly
and twirl it until the syrup runs
down to the stick and spreads
smoothly over the apple. Stand
skewer in a small glass or cake
rack so that apple will not touch
anything while cooling.
Apples should be made the day
they are to be used because moisture
from apple will soften candy
and make it sticky. Dipping must
be done rapidly or syrup will become
too stiff for coating.

D e i’red Extra Bathroom
Need Take Little Space
Few houses are being built today
without two bathrooms, or at
least a bathroom and extra lavatory.
In the modernization of an
old house, consideration should be
given to this feature.
Plumbing authorities have found
that the essential fixtures of a bathroom
can be installed in a floor
space which measures five feet one
way and six feet the other. Space
at the unused end of the hallway
often may be converted into an extra
bathroom, and in some cases

Contributed Hit 'Spud
Quilp of Dicken’s “Old Curiosity
Shop” has a modern counterpart in
Emil Celia of Baltimore; and begging
your pardon, before we explain the
similarity ’twixt Quilp and Celia, nicknamed
Feet, let us digress and tell a
tale about the word “counterpart".
(This is purely a stream of consciousness.)
To a newspaper man it happened—
as it generally does sooner or later to
all men if they marry—a son was
born. The excited father dashed off
an ode for his paper dedicated to “My
Son, My Pigmy Counterpart.” The
paper was duly published and contained
the ode with this caption: “ My Son,
My Pig, My Counterpart.” Was his
face red ?
Now as you remember, if you’ve
read “The Old Curiosity Shop,” Quilp
was a dreadful dwarfed creature who
terrified his wife and little Nell by
eating boiled eggs— shells and all—
drinking boiling water and bending
tenpenny nails with his teeth. Today
we read that one Celia likes to eat
hard crabs with the shells on, and
claims the world’s beer-drinking: record:
one-half gallon in 16 seconds
Some record! and he’s welcome to that
record for swilling! I t ’s nothing to be
proud of!
* * *
And speaking of crab— we warned
you this was purely stream of consciousness—
we read recently how an
otter eats a clam. Crab—clam—there
is some similarity: both sea food; both
start with c— ; both four letter words;
well, let’s find out how an otter eats
a clam as described by Dr. Edna H.
Fisher to a Pacific Science Congress.
(And a fisher should know, and how!)
Here’s how: “After catching a clam
the otter dives to the ocean floor,
picks up a hefty rock, rises to the surface,
floats on his back, balances the
rock on his belly, clasps the clam between
his forepaws, brings it down on
the rock with a mighty whack. Shell
broken, otter eats.” Just like that!
Try it some time! You might be surprised!
# * #
By the bye—did any of you see
Ferdinand? He likes to smell flowers
— remember? He likes to eat corn
meal too. In New Orleans, Ferdinand.
1,000 lb. Jersey bull, pushed half way
through a fencehole. devoured a 100 lb.
sack of cornmeal, got stuck. To Ferdinand’s
rump, Owner William Lackley,
lacking a bee, applied the live terminals
of an electric battery, shocked
Ferdinand free. Nice work.
Incidentally on Long Island. American
bull fighter Sidney Franklin, resplendent
in cerise cape and a sheathed
wooden sword, gnt ready to put on a
bull-dodginj? act for a New York
Fair's Rodeo. On hand were representatives
of the S. P. C. A., 200 spectators
and a bull in a corral. When
somebody opened the grate to the corral.
nothing happened. To attract the
bull’s attention cowboys did a dance
in front of the gate. The bull didn’t
budge. Steers were driven down the
chutes as decoys. The bull looked the
other way. Twenty minutes later,
after considerable prodding, the bull
ambled down the chute. Fighter
Franklin’s act, described by the S. IV
C. A. as eminently humane, got under
way.

And now with Hallowe’en so close
here’s hoping that our well hc-haved
young people will give us no window
cleaning jobs and no house raising
parties. After all there are ways of
having loads of fun without soaping

all that sort of thing. Here’s for a
'pierrier, saner, less destructive Hallowe’en
than we’ve ever had before!
RESOLUTION
Whereas we the undersigned members
of the W’ittenberg Townsend Club
listened to the speeches of the politicians
last year and our present Governor
said that if he was elected to
office he would see that the old people
got a liberal pension and his actions
during the last Legislature was directly
opposite to everything he said last
year, therefore be it resolved that we
will remember this at the next election.
Resolved that a copy of this be
printed in The Wittenberg Enterprise
and also in the Shawano, Antigo and
Wausau papers and one copy sent to
the Governor.

HE A D L I N E S F R OM THE LI VES
OF P EOP L E LI KE Y O U I S E LFI
“The Tale of the Galloping Tooth”
He l l o e v e r y b o d y :
You may have been in France during the unpleasantness
that went on there in 1914-1918. You may have seen towns shelled
to a crumbling ruin. You may have seen regiments decimated
by poison gas. You may have seen men torn to pieces by bursting
grenades a n d families pauperized and turned out of their
homes by the onward plunge of the great German war machine.
You may think you know all about the horrors of war, but Don
Aspinwall of Rochelle Park, N. J., will tell you you haven’t
| seen anything.
Don was somewhere in the Villers Cotteret area on special
d u ty with the Second division. A deafening barrage had been
rolling back and forth across the lines for more than two hours.
The Germans were tossing every form of pyrotechnic display in
their bag of tr ic k s . Huge 9.2’s roared overhead like great express
trains. Machine-gun bullets zipped by. An occasional ash
can from a miniewerfer battery would tumble lazily through
the early morning haze to spread itself with a devastating roar
in front of the barbed wire. It was a swell time to be someplace
else. But horror? Horror, nothing! The real horror was going
on right inside Don Aspinwall’s face.
Don Had a Toothache.
It w a s u n d o u b t e d ly the o u t s t a n d in g d is a s t e r o f th e w h o le
w a r . It h a d been g o in g on fo r 24 h o u r s a n d Don w a s c o n vinced
that if it went on two hours longer nothing could keep the
Germans from taking Paris. And Don was miles away from any possible
agency of relief. The only thing that could have stopped that
ache would be a well-placed bullet, and Don was all in favor of that.
“ I tell you,” he says, "the actual Gospel truth. I poked my head over
Uncle—John. I hear you’ve chosen
a good profession—are your prospects
good?
A irm a n—Well, I ’ve made a flying
start at least.
Double Trouble
"The trouble with you is the same
as with another patient of m ine ,"
said the doctor. "H e worried and
got nervous dyspepsia. He was
worrying himself to death about his
tailor's bill. Now he is cured."
"B u t how did you cure h im ? "
asked the patient.
“ Told him to stop worrying, and
he’s done so," replied the doctor.
" I know," was the doleful answer.
'1 know he has. But I'm his tailor.”
"H e says he's a big gun in the city
government."
"D o n 't believe It—the reports
from his department are too sm a ll."
There are two races of the periodical
cicada—the seventeen-year
race and another that appears ev
■ry 13 years. Scientists haVe found
io differences in the two except
hat one remains underground in the
arva sand pupa stages four years
on iter than the other.
Kvery year is locust year In some
iart of the country. There are 17
lifTerent broods of the 17 yenr race

A man dashed into the police station
at midnight.
"M y wife,” he gasped. “ I want
to flr.d my wife! Been missing since
eight this evening. Oh, find her for
m e !”
" P a r tic u la r s ? " asked the sergeant.
"H e ig h t? "
" I —I don’t know.”
“ Do you know how she was
dressed?"
"No, but she took the dog with
her.”
"W h at kind of dog?”
"B rind le bull terrier, weight 53
pounds, four dark blotches on hia
body shading from grey to white,
three white legs, and right front leg
brindled all but the toes. A small
nick in his left ear.”
“ That'll d o !” gasped the sergeant.
“ We'll find the d o g !"
Good Reason
Two women were taking a stroll
near Hollywood when a m an with a
red flag rushed out and waved them
away. “ Don’t go there,” he shouted;
“ you’ll spoil it— a movie is being
shot."
"W e ll,” retorted one of the women,
icily, “ if it’s the one I saw last
night it deserves to be shot."
AS USUAL
'J
“ He had no anesthetic, but glancing behind me I knew the worst.
A stolid-faced six-foot Yorkshire orderly had sneaked in/*
the top of the trench several times and gave Jerry the Bronx Salute in
the sincere hope that some Germ an officer might take offense and
order me erased with a machine-gun, field battery or some other similarly
effective weapon.”
Attempts at Suicide Came Back Labeled, “ No Dice.’9
But no Germ an officer would have been sucker enough to
halt such an effective blow to the Allied cause. All Don's attempts
at suicide came back to him labeled. “ No Dice.’* He had to
wait until he was relieved from duty and then, in a semi-delirium
he lit out for the nearest British medical unit two miles away.
Eventually he got there and was ushered into the presence of a
brass hat who turned him over to a young medical lieutenant.
“ It took him five minutes to diagnose the case of acute
toothache.” says Don. and then he seated me in an improvised
dental chair and looked worried. It seems there wasn’t any local
anesthetic in that part of the country and—well—what to do?
Don told him what to do. He told him to get that tooth out of
there and to hell with the anesthetic. That d id n’t seem quite cricket to
the young Englishman. He demurred for a moment. Then he seemed
to have an idea and said, ‘‘All right, Yank. But I say, it will bally-well
hurt you more than it does me "
“ With those words of comfort,” says Don, “ he stepped out for a
minute. When he came back I watched him open a shabby black bag
and produce a none-too-clean pair of ordinary gas pliers. He had no
anesthetic, but glancing behind me I knew the worst. A stolid-faced
six-foot Yorkshire orderly had sneaked in. He stood at my back toying
with the barrel of a massive British Webley navy type revolver and
gauging the distance to certain sections of my skull with a practiced
eye. I didn’t have long to think about that though.”
Don didn't have any time to think about it at all. The minute
he turned his head he felt something hit it that felt like a nudge
from a howitzer. There was a blinding flash and a million stars,
pin-wheels, constellations and blue lights danced before his eyes.
“ I began to fall into a deep, black void,” he says. “ At last,
I thought, the Germans had planted a nice, juicy shell under the
dental chair, and I was all ready to put forth my hand and
receive my harp and halo. Then I began to be aware of a disconcerting
fact. I could still feel a dull throb where my toothache
had heen. and now there was another dull throb in the back of
my head.”
Gradually both old and new throbs increased in intensity. The black
before Don's eyes faded to a gray haze, and through it he began to see
the features of the young British medical attendant. There was a large
moving blur behind the attendant. The haze cleared a little more and
Don could see it was the Yorkshire orderly. The orderly was calmly
wiping the butt of his Webley and Don distinctly remembers noticing that
several brown hairs still adhered to that butt. Don’s hair is brown,
too. He says that might, or might not, have been a coincidence.
And What a Climax.
And then the doctor spoke.
Don couldn’t hear what he was saying very well, but the picture of
what happened was beginning to take shape in his brain. That Yorkshire
orderly had been the anesthetic. He had socked Don on the coco
with the butt of that revolver. And now the medical attendant seemed
to be apologetic about it.
Don stopped h im . . “ Don’t worry, doc,” he said. “ It's all right
with me. It was a swell job, even if your anesthetic was a bit
rough.”
The attendant shook his head and began to repeat his words. “ Then,”
says Don, “ my confused brain began to function as I heard that E nglishman
say, *0h, I'm sorry, Yank, but I haven’t done anything yet,
you know. You see m y orderly worked too fast and I had to wait until
you came out of it SO YOU COULD T E L L M E WHICH TOOTH IT W A S!’ ”

Lim it Taverns to 2,198 — Henceforth,
Milwaukee w ill have a legal
limit of 2,198 taverns. For the present,
however, there will be 2,202—
until four licenses are withdrawn or
revoked.
It Finally Happened — This accident
had to happen sooner or later.
Carl Kroessler of Chicago was hitchhiking
on a road near La Crosse.
As a truck came along, he put out
h ii thumb. The truck struck and
fractured Kroessler’s hand.

Holstein Sets Record — In making
an official record of 742 pounds of
butterfat from 18,952 pounds of milk,
a two year old purebred Holstein,
Wis. Ormsby Lass, owned by the in dustrial
school for boys at Waukesha
produced more than four times the
production of the average American
COW'.
Give Pennies for Trees— Approximately
28,740 Wisconsin school children
have contributed 71,851 pennies
to plant 287,404 trees in a new Nicolet
national forest near Eagle River.
The U. S. forest service provides the
seedlings at the rate of four for a
penny in order to interest children
in conservation.
No Salary Raises— The Milwaukee
city service commission came to the
assistance of the board of estimates
by proclaiming that it would not
hold any job reclassification hearings
this year. The decision means that
requests for new titles, carrying with
them substantial pay increases, w ill
not be allowed.
Order Tree Seedlings Soon—Farmers,
who want tree seedlings for oneacre
plantations next spring, should
place their orders before November
10. County agents throughout the
state w ill be in position to receive
the orders. The limit of the number
of trees which any one person may
obtain is set at 1,000, additional trees
may be obtained b> purchase.
Du Pont Enlarging Plant — E I.
Du Pont de Nemours  Co. has
started construction of a new TNT
unit at its explosives plant at Barksdale,
near Washburn. The new* plant
will replace a smaller one now in
operation and will require employment
of approximately 100 men,
bringing the total pay roll to 400.
The construction was ordered because
of an increase in business.
A dult Students Increase—The U niversity
of Wisconsin extension d iv ision
recorded off-campus instruction
to adult students in every Wisconsin
county, every state in the Union and
some foreign countries. A total of
339,577 have enrolled since the
founding of the extension division.
Of this total, 148,766 took correspondence
courses and 190.811 attended
classes. University class cen-
‘ers have been established in 55 Wisonsin
cities.
1940 Fair Aug. i7 to 25— A bandoning
the proposal to lengthen the fair
from 9 to 12 days, the 1940 Wisconsin
state fair has been set for Aug. 17
through Aug. 25. Because of the
congestion on the more popular days
of the fair, which set an all-time attendance
record of 630,954 this year,
the fair management considered
stretching out the exposition three
more days. The idea was given up
because there were too many objec*
tions to a longer fair.
August Relief Load Higher — Foi
the first time in five years the n um ber
of Wisconsin persons receiving
general relief increased between
Ju ly and August, it was announced
by the state department of public
welfare. It reported 567 more caser
in August as compared with Ju ly foi
the highest August relief load since
the federal works program began
operation. It was 11 per cent higher
than last August and 56 per cen4
higher than August 1937.
State Finances Low — Unless the
state holds up payments due in December
to counties and municipalities,
the state will be virtually
“ bankrupt” by the first week in December
and unable to meet its pay
roll and other expenses, State Treasurer
John Smith announced. Smith
said that the treasury now held approximately
$4,000,000 and that he
believed revenues that could be anticipated
/or the remainder of the
year would fail to cover expenditures.
Traffic Deaths Decrease -With fatalities
reduced 15 per cent, August
of 1938 was the safest August for
Wisconsin motorists and pedestrians
since the state reporting law war
adopted in 1935. State highway commission
records show 61 traffic
deaths this August, compared with
72 fatalities in the same month of
1938. Serious accidents dropped
from 905 to 77^. and injuries from
884 to 711. With Trempealeau county
reporting its first traffic death of tho
year in September, only five counties
were left on safety’s honor roll
of death-free counties

Exercise Is Important.
Rest and exercise must be prescribed

just as important as is exercise to
the easy-going, overweight individual.
Fresh air and sunshine are good
for both. Most individuals with high
blood pressure eat too much and exercise
too little.
The second cause of high blood
pressure to be prevented or corrected
is infection. The infection may
come from tonsils, teeth, gall bladder,
intestine or other parts of the
body. With each infection may come
just a slight inflammation of the lining
of the blood vessels, w-ith the
result that the muscular or elastic
coat of the blood vessels is replaced
by a hard tissue.

Liver Acts
As Natural Filter
A few years ago I found that I
was writing about the liver so often
that I practically stopped writing
about it. To mo it is still king of
the organs, and the old saying “ life
depends upon the liver’’ is replaced
by “ health depends upon the liver.”
We are not apt to think of the liver
as the organ most important to life,
because stopping the heart beat
means immediate death, whereas
stopping or sluggishness of the liver
still allows life to go on for a considerable
time. But from the health
standpoint, the liver is your most
important organ.
Why? Poisons entering the body
by way of the mouth or directly
into the blood are immediately
seized by the liver cells, and the
great majority of them are held by
the liver and thus prevented from
doing damage. Harm ful substances
are brokfcn down by the liver, are
rendered harmless and pass out of
the system in the urine. The liver
is nature’s great filter.
Dye Test Often Used.
Thus, in testing the “ health” of
the liver and its ability to remove
poisons from the blood, what is
known as the dye test is made
whereby a dye is taken by mouth
or into a vein and the blood is examined
at intervals to see how long
it takes the liver to remove these
poisons. A definite amount of the
dye should be removed within a definite
time.
What can you and I do in the
way of keeping the liver in good
condition to do all its jobs, including
filtering out poisons from the blood?
The two ways to keep liver healthy
and active are (a) by bending exercises
(knees straight) and breathing
exercises, both of which
“ squeeze” this large, soft organ, and
(b) by eating small meals (even if
four a day are eaten), thu? not overworking
the liver. A little fat—
j cream, butler, bacon — eaten at
i breakfast time is a good stimulator
i of the liver pr esses ard helps
empty the gall bladder, thm prei

0 A General Q uiz
F A S H IO N is growing in-
* creasingly lace-inspired.
As the style picture for the
winter social season unfolds
the importance of
lace is emphasized throughout
every phase of the
mode.
Time was when lace was
considered a special-occasion
item but as regarded today,
lace becomes a positive fashion
“ m ust” in every well-planned wardrobe.
I t ’s as good style to wear lace
in the daily routine of affairs as it is
to array in lace for those dram atic
highspot moments when every woman
seeks to look her loveliest and
most alluring.
To be sure in the interest of good
taste discrimination must be exercised
in choosing the right lace for
the right place.
With suits as popular as they are
this winter the call for a collection
of blouses becomes imperative. Of
course there should be at least one
lace blouse included in the list and
several of varied-type lace will
prove none too many. The lace
blouse pictured to the right in the
foreground of the illustration herewith
is styled to a nicety, with a
softly draped front, wide full sleeves
end a peplum which has a slight
bustle treatment in bark. Wear it
with a velvet skirt and a cunning
velvet toque for any afternoon occasion
which calls for a dress-up
costume.
The new metallic embroidered
laces make up beautifully into fitted
jacket-blouse types such as you see
centered in the group, and if you
are going to dinner dances this winter
or banqueting with socialites,
a formal jacket and skirt dress
becomes a necessary luxury these
times. Perhaps the charming
model here shown will help you in
making a selection when it comes
to “ looking up” a correctly styled
evening dress. A truly beautiful
lace is this in creamy beige embel-
Evening Glamor
There is no lim it to the wealth
of jewelry fashion urges ladies
who are style-ambitious to wear
this season, especially when it
comes to attending night-time functions.
In the picture hand fashioned
gold plated beads strung on
heavy knotted silk cord, designed
by Simonne Gerli, as new as the
world of tomorrow, contrast d ram
atically with the old world elegance
of an evening bag of ancient
Egyptian silk brocade which is reembroidered
in gold thread. The
dynamic young designer medallions
the hundred-year-old Egyptian
frame w-ith butterfly motifs in Ita lian
mosaic. The story of handbags
for this season promises to be a
thrilling one.
The Q u e stio n s
1. Does a ship m ade of steel
weigh more or less than one of
wood of the same size?
2. From what did Lake Erie
get its name?
3. How recently were bows and
arrows used in warfare?
4. If a bullet is shot through a
board, which gets through first,
the bullet or the hole?
5. What is the greatest degree
of longitude a place may have?
The A nsw e rs
1. One of steel weighs Ms less.
2. From the Erie or Cat tribe
of Indians, which once dwelt along
the south shore.
3. Bows and arrows were used
as recently as in the Napoleonic
wars. When Napoleon invaded
Russia the latte r’s armies included
Tartars who used bows and arrows
and were dead shots up to
100 yards.
4. The hole.
5. The greatest degree is 180.
lished with metal threadwork
achieving that air of elegance so
characteristic of this season’s fashions.
The classic simplicity of the
handsome flared skirt of monotone
net sets off the glory of the superbly
beautiful metallic embroidered lace
basque to perfection. The resplendent
bib necklace and wide bracelets
are just such as fashion decrees
shall be worn on gala occasions
with one’s handsomest gown.
When a very voluminous skirt is
of black lace with a deep flounce of
matching lace about the very wide
hemline, when the bodice blouse
worn with it is of cerise red satin I
with a mantilla-like lace fichu en- i
veloping the shoulders as pictured
to the left in the group, you sense,
and rightly so, that the costume reflects
Spanish influence. You know
also that the ensemble interprets
tne “ lest word” in high fashion.
Also the message of exquisite black
lace for evening wear is conveyed
to you in unmistakable terms. The
separate little shoulder cape or
fichu is a decided feature of evening
dresses this season.
The flair for lace is, however, not
confined to formal dress. On the
doytim * program lace is assigned
a leading role. One of the cleverest
uses of lace is to trim sheer black
wool or crepe afternoon frocks with
black lace edging in exactly the
same manner as val lace edging is
used on lingerie dresses and blouses.
You will find these lace-trimmed
blacks very flattering and youthful
in aspect as they are styled with
naive simplicity.

Eyeleted Pique Is
Important Style
The new eyelet embroidered piques
now showing are creating a sensation.
The simpler eyeleted patternings
are ideal for the smart tailored
shirtwaist to wear with your suit.
The eyelet embroidered edgings
make up beautifully in collar and
cuff sets. Boleros to wear over dark
crepe frocks or linen tailleurs are
ever so chic in eyelet embroidered
pique. Milliners are also doing
clever things with the new piques.
Taking it all in all it promises to
be very much of a pique season
