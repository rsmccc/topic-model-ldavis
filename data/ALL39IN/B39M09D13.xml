         <p>THE COUNTY FAIR
WAS REALLY GOOD
The Jackson County Fair closed
Tuesday night It was a mixture of
the good with the bad A combination
o f the excellent with medium
and inferior The bad and the inferior
refers strictly to the weather
and that was by no means all bal 
The Black River Falls Alma Center 
Hixton and Melrose high school
bands were there and furnished inspiring
music as per schedule ine
people o f the county have every reason
to be proud o f these four groups
o f well trained musicians Sunday
the Winona Municipal band took part
in the parade and later gave a drill 
This band was led by a pompous
drum major who knew how to strut
his stuff and to twirl and toss his
baton He was followed by three
girls o f uniform type and dress who
also were skilled in twirling the
batons and changing position while
marching The music o ft h is b a n d
was fine and more o f a martial order
Saturday morning it rained but
that did not appear to dampen the
ardor nor the enthusiasm o f the ex
hibitors certainly not the 4 H exhib
itors They began coming in early
and by the middle o f the afternoon
practically all o f the exhibits were in
5 5 ? The sky had cleared and
everything was ready for a big day
 UThe day was ideal for fair going 
and some say 8 000 peop e were at
the day and night exhibitions they
found the largest and best showing
in the livestock departments cattle
predominating The cattle barn
filled and so was a large tent secur
ed from La Crosse and several he ad
had to be put in the hog andsheep
pens In the open classes there were
Holsteins Guernseys Brown Sw ss
Shorthorns and Jerseys Probaby
the Holsteins were best certainly
there were adult animals o
breed good enough for any company 
There were a lot o f classy heifers
e x h ib it ? d w t a t
o f greater importance from the
breeders standpoint were the 28 P re
bred bulls owned and exhibited by the
4 H members When the progeny of
those 4 H bulls and 4 H heifers are
shown there will be a stock show in
Jackson county second onl 
best o f the State fairs The improve
ment in Jackson county tock the
nast few years has been remarKaDie
and it means far more th an th em ost
o f our citizens realize both to the
farmers and to the county as a whole 
The exhibits o f horses was also
outstanding More animals on display
than for many years and the
quality exceedingly high A P eas
Sir feature was the large number o f
suckling colts The well matched
teams o f heavy horses were a delight
to the horse lovers eye and how
some o f those teams could pull Paul
Casoer s team won first m the lign
team pull and Fred Drecktrah s team
won first for heavy weights 
The hog exhibit also was good 
Poland Chinas f e s t e r Whites Berkshires 
Durocs and Hampshires were
 hown Among them were more than
a dozen mothers with their ?merou 
and lively families of
brought many squeals o f delight fro
the children who never tired o f watcn

In showing t h e results of careful
selection in breeding stock There
was hardly room enough to show aU
to the best advantage but they were
there and their merits plainly to be
seen 
In the Woman s building many declared
the exhibit o f needle work and
the educational display to be the big
and th b ? t I W *?
T  m e ? p ? c per 
S is building both attracted a lot of
merited attention 
The most and the prettiest flowers
ever shown was the undisputed verdict
There was also a great display
of culinary articles but the space and
the facilities in that building are entirely
inadequate to make a creditd

There were also a number o f tra er*

probably many other articles which
missed the wondering eyes o f the u J
scribe 
Underneath the grand stand the
booths on the south side w ereall occupied
by the twenty 4 H clubs The
names o f these different clubs making
such attractive displays will be
given elsewhere The entries probkblv
covered a greater number of
articles than ever before and all were
o f commendable merit and o f a high
unless it were the field and
garden products These were neither
as large nor o f good quality as usual 
f fact due to unfavorable growing
conditions 
On the north side the miniature
wild life refuge with its m anyspec es
o f forest trees shrubs that will produce
winter feed for birds :it 
tic grasses and other plants lt~ 
terfalls and ponds containing trout
and pike and its many vaneties o l
mounted game birds was a really
worthwhile exhibit It gave far
clearly than is possible by jpok en or
written words a clear and definite
idea o f what a wild life refuge really
is The exhibit was the result o f
many hours o f labor by Wm A 
MR AND MRS W ILL COLBY TO CELEBRATE 50TH ANNIVERSARY

A TRIO OF AUTO ACCIDENTS
Yesterday evening Tuesday Mrs 
Sophia Rudd who lives near Hiway
12 just beyond the Oak Ridge church 
was crossing the road carrying a long
stick o f wood when two autos approached 
Mrs Rudd waited until
one auto had passed and not seeing
the other started across the road 
The driver o f the auto a California
car avoided striking Mrs Rudd but
struck the pole she was carrying 
knocking the woman down She was
picked up and brought to the Krohn
hospital ?where she was found to have
suffered a broken leg and a fractured
skull Mrs Rudd is almost 80
years o f age a widow who has been
living alone Her serious accident is
greatly regretted by her friends 
Monday night two cars collided on
Hiway 12 just south o f Merrillan 
One auto belonged to W W Beebe
o f New Richmond the other to Harry
Dunlap o f Rochester N Y Mr Dunlap
is a cousin o f Charles Dunlap o f
Alma Center and is visiting him his
first visit to this section in 26 years 
With him in the car was a friend 
Goldie Hamon also o f Rochester It
is reported that the Beebe auto ran
into the Dunlap car which was smashed
and thrown into the roadside ditch 
Mr Dunlap called from Merrillan
j notifying Officer Bernie Finch who
went at once and investigated the accident 
No one was seriously injured 
The auto was brought to the
Hardy Garage Tuesday morning 
Sunday Leo Printz and Lyle Posvic
o f Melrose attended the County
Fair driving in with the Printz car 
About 10:30 Printz being tired went
to sleep in the back seat o f the car 
An hour or so later Posvic decided it
was time to go home and started out
without wakening Printz Just past
the Harvey Meyers farm on 54 Posvic
also went to sleep The car plunged
into a 7 foot ditch Posvic was cut
up a lot and badly bruised He got
out o f the wreck and went to the
I Meyers home for help A tourist came
along and hearing Printz hollering
for help he got him out and took him
to the Meyers home Posvic was cut
about the head face and legs Traffic
Officer Finch was notified and
also Posvic s parents and Printz aunt
with whom he lives The young men
were brought to the Krohn hospital
where their injuries received surgical
attention Fortunately neither was
seriously injured and both are now
able to be out 
Schunke who mounted the many
birds 
Right along with the wild life refuge
was a miniature farm showing
vividly just what is being done in
the way o f erosion control This was
well executed informative and educational 
In connection with these was
the display o f protected forest trees
and a strip o f burned over land w ith
all trees and vegetation killed This
was by the state conservation commission 
prepared by the local ranger
station 
Frank Smith o f Melrose had a
large exhibit o f furniture; Waughtal
showed an auto and a device for testing
auto wheels; Homstaad s Lumber
Company was represented and Gilbertson
showed refrigerators The
radio controlled airplane made by the
Neillsville boys also attracted attention 
The Jackson County Safety
Council had a booth for testing the
sight and other qualifications o f auto
drivers The force was busy testing
applicants all o f the time Another
booth arranged by County Nurse
Johnson showed maternity and baby
clothing and other articles connected
with nursing service 
A large tent covered the display
o f the county Co operatives which attracted
a lot o f attention from a constant
stream o f visitors and the adjacent
movie show was crowded at all
i times The midway contained more
separate stands than ever before and
there was a noticeable absence o f
cheap and questionable shows Many
of the stands catered to the wants
o f the inner man while the Melrose 
Hixton and Lutheran Ladies Aids provided
more substantial meals 
The special attractions were good
and came up to expectations formed
by reading the advertisements Perhaps
the greatest disappointment to
the Fair goers was when the rain
Monday afternoon interfered with
the ball game The teams B R 
Falls Merchants and the Trempealeau
County All Stars are two as good
semi professional teams as can be
found in the state They were in the
pink o f condition and all keyed up
for a battle royal The game was
called at 4:45 under a dark and
threatening sky A fter five innings
rain stopped the game with the Merchants
leading 1 to 0 
Rain continued until midnight or
later Tuesday morning the sun
came out and it was not only clear
 but warm The fair grounds soon
dried up and a good crowd assembled
to see the double shows both afternoon
and evening They were pleased
with the fireworks and the 1939
Fair closed in a blaze o f glory 
So many o f our citizens have been
so favorably impressed with the clear 
cold water coming from the well at
the Castle Mound park and so manyfervent
wishes have been expressed
that just such clear cold water should
come through the pipes o f the city
water system that rumors have become
rife that the city authorities
would put down a test well in that
vicinity and see if an ample supply
could be obtained there There is
really no truth in the rumors as it is
well know that an ample supply o f
just such water could be secured
much more cheaply and conveniently
from the big springs near the old iron
furnace Chemical analysis shows that
all o f the water from these different
sources although clear and cold is
heavily impregnated with iron and is
quite hard and would not prove satisfactory
in the long run for household
purposes Something will soon have
to be done to give Black River Falls
an ample supply of better water but
it is hardly probable that it will come
from the vicinity o f Castle Mound 
This community suffered from the
intense heat and humidity last Thursday 
All previous records were
equaled or beaten as in Chicago 
where a record o f 98 established just
50 years ago was topped by two degrees 
A cool wind from the north
came down about six o clock bringing
fresh air and the night was delightful 
WISCONSIN S OLDEST
BLACKSMITH
The La Crosse Tribune o f Sunday 
September 3 carried an interesting
story and a fine picture o f a man
who was said to be The state s oldest
blacksmith Through the courtesy
o f the Tribune we are this week
carrying the picture and many o f our
readers would at once recognize the
profile o f Peter R Olson even if no
name was used in connection therewith 
The typical blacksmith as portrayed
by picture prose and poetry is
a large husky man with bulging
muscles Peter R Olson is not of
that type Slightly less than five and
a half feet in height he seldom if
ever weighed more than 145 pounds 
Early in his apprenticeship he acquired
a skill in the handling of
heavy horses which enabled him to
stand up under the strain o f horse
shoeing that would have broken the
back of many a larger man 
When southern Jackson county was
a large producer o f grain and this
grain was hauled into Black River
Falls over frozen roads and much ice 
was the time when Mr Olson was
called upon to shoe a lot o f heavy
horses While his record day s work
was the shoeing o f ten full span of
horses he approached that record
many and many a day Usually a
horse shoers record is stated in the
number o f shoes nailed on in a single
day In those terms Mr Olson s record
is 80 shoes 
Incidently the reason why the story
o f his activities was published in the
La Crosse Tribune was because he
was 92 years o f age September 7th 
1939 Mr Olson spent his birthday
at his home in this city greeting his
children grandchildren and greatgrandchildren 
He is enjoying good
health and is active for one o f his
advanced years 
Mr and Mrs Thorn E Grae left
Monday to return to their home at
Wilbur Oregon They came here at
the time o f the Centennial and during
their sojourn here also visited
relatives and friends in La Crosse 
Ettrick and other places in the county 
They also attended the funeral
o f Mr Gray s brother Charles Trondson 
at Black Duck Minn several
weeks ago and before their return
here visited in Minnesota for a couple
o f weeks or more While in the city
they were guests at the home o f his
brother and sister Dr A S Trondson
and Mrs Emma McCallum and their
nephew C F McCallum 
Mesdames Margaret Hentschel and
Edward Mertis o f Chicago spent last
week in a cottage at Lake Arbutus 
Mrs Hentschel and her husband operated
a store and farm in the Bohemian
settlement in Komensky for
many years The store and other
buildings have been razed by the federal
forces opening up the Central
Wisconsin wild life refuge 
I OUR POST OFFICE HAS
TEAR GAS EXPERIENCE
Last Saturday afternoon at 5 :20
 o clock while the government travel 
I ing mechanician W A Straus was
{installing tear gas bombs in the vault
[of the new post office building as a
precaution against burglary three of
the cartridges exploded due to defective
part in the mechanism The gas
quickly filled the entire building 
routing out the entire force Naturally
Mr Strauss knew how to protect
himself although the explosions
were right at his feet and he advised
the others to get O lt as quickly
as possible Even then some o f them
had all o f the tear gas they ever want
to experience 
A fter a time some o f the more
daring ones entered the building with
damp towels across their faces to
open windows and start electric fans 
Business was resumed at 6 :30 p m 
although there still was considerable
gas in the building Even today 
Wednesday they could not enter the
vault until the doors were left open
and the big fan kept running for
quite a time and the odor and effect
o f the gas upon the eyes and throat
was quite noticeable 
This is said to have been the first
time such an accident has occurred
while the installation has been going
on and practically all U S post
offices are so protected It was fortunate
that the accident occurred
when an expert was at hand to handle
the situation and doubly fortunate
that no one suffered more than
they did 
Erwin Moen has been spending the
past couple o f months in a very quiet
j way for him for he usually has a
whole bunch o f things ahead that he
plans to do He has been laid up as
the result o f injuries and returned to
Madison last FYiday for a check up at
the hospital Last July he had the
prospect o f a job in Yellowstone Park
for the summer and hitch hiked out to
get it He took longer on the way
than he had planned and arrived too
late to get a job About July 5th he
started for home The next day he
was standing on the outskirts of
Glendive Montana talking to two
fellows that he and Sid Strasburg had
worked with in the mines in Nevada
two years before His bag with his
top coat lying on it were beside him
on the ground A tramp snatched the
two articles and jumped on a passing
freight Erwin after him He was running
along the top o f the train and
not used to it lost his balance and
fell He was then four or five miles
from Glendive and the train going
better than 40 miles an hour Erwin s
fall resulted in a shoulder out of
joint and tore the ligaments o f his
leg loose at the knee besides injuring
the knee cap He dragged himself up
on the road and for a couple o f miles
back toward Glendive without being
able to get any help from passersby 
Then a truck stopped and Erwin asked
the driver to send out the police 
They were there in a short time took
him to the hospital and notified his
parents Mr and Mrs B I Moen o f
this city From here on there are
rays o f light on Erwin s experience 
The police were grand to him so
were the doctors and nurses A week
later he was put on the train for
home and arrived safely He spent a
week in Madison and has since had
his leg in a cast and been able to stay
at home where he is more than appreciative
of the thoughtfulness o f
1 his friends although the inaction of
his present condition irks him Now
comes some more good parts o f the
story A couple o f weeks after he
arrived home here came his bag and
coat The railroad officials Glendive
and Dickinson police picked up the
; tramp who snatched them and recov 
1 ered the bag intact Nothing was lost
: and it contained a lot o f articles valj
uable to Erwin 
Mr and Mrs Herman J Gebhardt
and the Misses Agnes and Sylvia Emerson
drove to Prairie du Chien last
Sunday and greatly enjoyed several
hours at Nelson Dewey park at the
confluence o f the Mississippi and
Wisconsin rivers

THEY HAVE A LOT OF
MUSIC TALENT
Black River Falls has a bevy o f
young ladies who have outstanding
music talent and who will be greatly
missed while they are away completing
their higher education They
have all given freely o f their time
and talents to school religious and
civic activities 
Leona Pratt s talent runs to the viola 
Prof Dailey was attracted by
her skill with that instrument while
Leona was still in high school and he
visited here with his friend and coworker
on the music faculty o f the
state university Paul Jones When
Leona first entered the university
Prof Dailey took her into his office
for special work Now that Prof 
Dailey has resigned his position at
I Madison to accept one o f the State
; Teachers College at Emporia Kansas 
Leona will attend that College for
her senior year s work and will con 
 tinue her services in Prof Dailey s
office 
Betty Jean Perry plays the piano
and has made a reputation for herself
as an accomplished pianist in
Madison as well as in Black River
Falls However her inclination runs
strongly to law a profession followed
by three generations o f the Perrys 
and she has had that idea in mind
during her two years at the state university 
She will return to the university
at Madison with music a little
in the ascendancy over law 
Verna Carlson has talen for both
the violin and piano although the
violin is her favorite instrument She
will enter Downer College at Milwaukee
with the purpose o f specializing
in music This will be her first year
away at school and her friends are
confident that Verna will make aname
for herself in music circles 
Last but only because she is the
youngest is Alene Trask During her
time in high school she has given
more time and study to the violin
and her talent with that instrument
is generally recognized but she has
a splendid voice that has shown remarkable
development during the past
year and to which she will give more
attention in the future Alene will
attend Stevens College at Columbia 
near St Louis Missouri Stevens
College has the reputation o f being
one o f the very best colleges o f its
class in the United States 
Perhaps in this connection mention
should be made o f Rose Mary Green 
who lived here tor a number o f years
quite recently Rose Mary has also
been a favorite pupil o f Prof Dailey
while attending the school o f music
at Madison She too will follow Prof 
Dailey and Leona Pratt to the State
Teachers College at Emporia Kansas 
While these young ladies will be
greatly missed Black River Falls has
a reputation for the development o f
music talent We are informed that
; there is a lot o f latent and partly
1 developed talent among the boys and
1 girls right now attending our high
school

Alfalfa Seed
Prospects for seed from secoAd
growth alfalfa are
This is the report o f L F Graber 
agronomist at the Wisconsin College
o f Agriculture He finds the prospects
particularly promising where
the first crop was not cut too early 
Where the first cutting was taken too
early considerable leaf hopper damage 
he reports developed in second
growth 
In regions where the second crop
is producing seed Graber is suggesting
that the crop can be harvested in
much the same manner as is red clover
seed The fields should be cut
he says when about two thirds or
three fourths o f the pods are brown
or black Either a combine may be
used or a mower with a bunching or
windrowing attachment With abundant
rainfall the ripened pods split
open and much o f the seed is lost 
Where alfalfa seed is cut with a
mower that has a bunching or windrowing
attachment the alfalfa is allowed
to dry in the field and then
run through a clover huller If there
should be delay in getting the hulling
done Graber cautions that the alfalfa
should be carefully handled in
a dry bam because with abundant
rainfall the pods open and the seed
is lost 
Swine Disease
Swine erysipelas is rapidly becoming
o f serious concern to Wisconsin
hog raisers 
The infection sometimes confused
with hog cholera threatens to become
a close second to that disease Dr 
B A Beach o f the College o f Agriculture 
reports that swine erysipelas
is widely prevalent in Wisconsin and
that it is causing considerable loss in
state herds 
 Animals suffering from the disease
refuse to eat and like to hide
themselves away in their bedding 
Beach says in describing the symptoms 
 High fever develops and o ften
large red spots appear over an
animal s body particularly on the
underside and on the ears and snout 
In Wisconsin joint swellings frequently
accompany infection 
Housing Important
 Little can be done for an animal
which the infections gets a foothold 
the veterinarian says Even though
the hog does recover it is many times
left in a weakened sickly condition 
unable to return much o f any profit
to its owner In the worst cases the
animal dies in from three to five
days 
Warm dry clean quarters are the
best protection against infection he
explains A serum has also been developed
which will check early cases
o f the disease and which will make
well animals immune 
Where the disease breaks out sick
animals should be isolated and the
herd closely watched for any further
signs o f trouble he recommends 
Newly purchased stock should be isolated
for two or three weeks before
being placed with the rest o f the
herd 
All Ages Get It
 Contaminated houses need to be
thoroughly cleaned by being scraped 
brushed and then scrubbed with boiling
hot lye water one pound o f llye
to 30 gallons o f water according to
Beach He also warns that the organisms
causing the disease can be
carried over in the ground on which
the hogs range 
Cool wet fall months just ahead
will bring more casrs o f erysipelas 
he feels Resistance then o f hogs kept
in drafty damp quarters is at a low
point and the animals are more likely
to succumb Weak unthrifty animals 
too are less resistant 
Swine o f all ages are subject to
attack by the disease although shoats
and suckling pigs suffer most he
said Erysipelas has also been observed
in lambs ducks and turkeys
and it can be transmitted to human
beings

CIVIL W AR LETTERS
The Civil war was brought to a
close at Appomattox Virginia seventy 
four years ago last April The
great majority o f its veterans have
long since gone to their reward but
only last week several hundred of
them gathered at Pittsburgh Pennsylvania 
at the annual national encampment
o f the Grand Army o f the Republic 
All the veterans attending
were over 90 years o f age and some
few had reached the century mark 
The survivors were filled with their
old time spirit even though most of
them were physically feeble 
Mark W Merchant o f Merrillan is
the only surviving Civil War veteran
o f the hundreds who lived in Jackson
county during the years following the
war Now 93 he keeps remarkably
well 
The present generation is far removed
from the disastrous civil conflict
in which the existence o f the nation
was at stake But for the valor
and patriotism o f the young men who
fought and won that war the good
old U S A might now be a dozen
countries probably as handicapped by
constant bickering as Europe continues
to be The passing o f the great
Grand Army therefore will not lessen
the interest all should feel in what
they did that those o f this time might
have a country like our own Interest
in the Civil war and its soldiers increases
as time goes on 
Recently we received from Martin
Torkelson copies o f several Civil war
letters writted by his good father 
Veteran Iver Torkelson who fought
in the Union army soon after he came
to this country from Norway 
Mr Torkelson was living with his
parents and brother Haldor in what
is now the town o f Franklin when he
enlisted in the service o f his adopted
country He made a fine record
as a soldier Upon his return from
the war he purchased what is now
known as the Robert Morgan farm in
Franklin which he continued to own
until 190? 
In 1881 Mr Torkelson was elected
register of deeds for Jackson
county and moved with his family to
Black River Falls He served several
terms in the register s office and was
prominent in the political affairs o f
the county and district Later he served
as postmaster o f this city during
the administration o f President Benjamin
Harrison He resided here
until his death an able conscientious
citizen who had the esteem and confidence
o f all 
During his war experience he wrote
home to his family and friends frequently 
His letters were in the language
o f his native land Several o f
them are treasured by his son Martin 
who has made the translations
which enable us to publish them in
English in the Banner Journal They
are interesting from an historical
standpoint as a portrayal o f the life
and times o f the soldier boys in the
great conflict The letters will be
published in installments as space
permits 
His first letter was written as the
Army o f the Cumberland o f which
his regiment the Fifteenth Wisconsin 
was a part was resting after the
bloody battle at Murfreesboro Kentucky 
and preparing for the campaign
which culminated in the severe
defeat o f the same army at the battle
o f Checkamauga Tennessee Apparently
he was invalided not long
after that as he was recovering from
an illness at Camp Dennison Ohio 
when the battle o f Checkamauga was
fought It is as follows:
Army life in camp Gen Rosecrans
was a very deliberate soldier The
bloody battle o f Murfreesboro had
been fought December 31 1862 and
January 1 and 2 1863 The Army
o f the Cumberland had remained
quiet during the interim 
Camp near Murfreesboro Tenn 
April 3rd 63
Dear Parents and Brother with W ife
and Children:
I find it again my duty to send you
some lines since I know that you
long to hear from me as I to hear
from you I am very well as regards
health and feel myself entirely well 
I can not have better days than now
while I am with the army and I am
so glad since I get letters from you
so regularly Yesterday I received
your letter o f March 26 which like
all o f your writings put good courage
into me so I will not let myself be
sold for a trifle now for many days 
We are now working with the saw
mill but just now we could do nothing
since we had no saw blade that
which we had brought to the blacksmith
to be sharpened was broken in
two another was sent for but it has
not come Last week it was quite
cold here so I was glad to use my
overcoat but now it is warm again
and I sit in my shirt sleeves writing
this letter in my tent 
Rosecrans army is still here near
Murfreesboro and it will hardly move
for a while since the forts are not
ready The rebels are said to be
gathered at Shelbyville in great
strength but so much is said here
that you can t believe anything unless
you see it 
The Scandinavian regiment is
camped not far from here since I
saw it in the daily marches through
Murfreesboro on its way to work 
General Rosecrans gave this regiment
more praise than any when he held a
review o f Davis Division He said
that he honored them because they
were soldiers through and through 
and not just half like many other
Regiments and once when Rosecrans
came into this Regiment s camp he
said that he was convinced that the
Scandinavians knew how to build
their campfires a simple thing but
generally overlooked in the Army 
I have taken such a big piece o f
paper that I must fill it with a little
story It is about a little Negro boy 
14 years old owned by Mr Lytle 
He often comes down to camp and
gives some kind o f performance that
we pay him for One day he came to
camp and offered to butt us (with his
head) He was soon taken up One
o f the boys undertook the combat
with him but every time the Negro
came running he dodged and grabbed
his head I told the Negro to take
them when they were not expecting
it This he did and many gave his
head a blow o f their fists but this
didn t bother the Negro I saw several
who rubbed their knuckles as if
they had struck a stone W e had both
pleasure an danger over the Negro
boy and it seemed as if things were
about to play out so I wondered how
we could liven things up a bit I
wanted to try if the wooly head was
as hard as it seemed I whispered to
him and pointed to a tent and asked
him if he couldn t butt the tentpole
down It was an oak plank an inch
thick He took a run like a buck
sheep into the plank with his bare
head so he bounced back Well
done cried many but knock it
down and then he took a longer run
than before and this time split the
plank and our jo y was renewed He
began backing up for another trial 
but I told him he had done enough 
and he stopped The next stroke
would have overthrown the tent and
that we didn t want because I was
sure his head was just as hard as a
buck sheep Here came Hermand
Pederson who owned the tent home
from the woods tired and ugly and
when he saw that the plank war; split 
he wanted to know what kinc o f a
rascal had done it Some sa d the
Negro boy had butted it to pieces 
Hermand flew after him threw him
down and gave him two goods kicks
in the head with the heel o f his
boots here s something for your
head you troll he said The Negro
got up his white teeth shining but
I think he laughted he certainly did
not cry Later I saw him butt a
board fence so that the splinters flew
around his ears This is almost unbelievable 
but true Sometimes we
coax this same boy and another a little
smaller to sing and dance for us 
which is very easy for all Negroes to
do among others we have persuaded
them to sing rebel songs which are
rarely heard since the white people
don t dare for their lives to do it In
such ways we find something to have
fun with otherwise the time would
be too long 
I see by your letters that there is
organized a new town up there and
idents since they must all be officers 
but these must also be all o f the residents 
since they mus tall be ocicers 
I would like to know the name o f this
new town please tell me the next
time you write You say that Father
is going to Sparta after the money ( I
am sending) when he gets a letter
from the Express Office but as the
package was addressed to Sparta he
will get no letter and I would wish
you to enquire about it as soon as
possible I know that the Express
was captured by the Rebels a while
after I sent my money and they got
hold o f 20 000 dollars Probably the
Company makes use o f its chances
and steals more than the enemy captures 
but think my money won t be
lost I rely on my luck 
You have not yet told me how high
the taxes were this year on us and
this you must do I wish to know
this since it is one o f the country s
important matters I do not remember
any more this time except to ask
you my broher to be so industrious
as to write as you have begun to do 
In closing I greet you all most
kindly and God give that these lines
may find you in good health Live
well IVER TORKELSON
(In English)
Don t forget the News and you
must try to find out all you can about
the courting matter and tell me
what you did with those letters which
I sent in your care You must not
t e ll o f anything or she will spoil
my fun

SECRETARY W ALLACE URGES
NO CHANGE IN FARM PLANS
Secretary o f Agriculture Henry A 
Wallace issued the following statement:
American farmers like all our citizens 
abhor war and will pray for a
speedy peace 
First o f all o f course the primary
effort o f the Department o f Agriculture 
together with all other
branches o f the Administration will
be to keep this country out o f war 
Secondary to that will be the effort
to protect American farmers and
consumers as fully as possible against
the effects o f war aboard 
War causes economic repercussions
in all countries It is only natural 
therefore that our farmers at this
moment are considering whether
they should modify their production
plans to meet the new situation 
I urge American farmers to proceed
with their production plans as if
the outbreak in Europe had not occurred 
American agriculture is in a much
better position to meet the shock of
war than it was 25 years ago As we
have kept pointing out the very machinery
which farmers have used to
adjust production to decreased demand
in peacetime can be used in
wartime to increase production if and
when that becomes advisable 
Some farmers remembering high
wartime prices may wish to discontinue
cooperation in their farm programs
in order to expand the acreage
o f wheat and other crops I would remind
them that the average prices of
wheat corn hogs and beef were lower
a year after the World war started
than they were in 1914 
The course o f prices for months
just ahead may not follow the pattern
o f 1914 and 1915 But present
supplies o f cotton wheat com meat
animals and many other commodities
are large There is little likelihood
that any substantial increase in production
o f the major crops will be desirable 
certainly not in the immediate
future In any case the need for
increases in supplies can be anticipated
in ample time to make any necessary
increases in acreages The
production o f large quantities o f agricultural
commodities for which
there is no satisfactory market could
prove just as demoralizing in wartime
as in peacetime 
I would remind American farmers
that the loans which are a part o f the
ever normal granary are available
right now to prevent price collapses 
ITiey can prevent such a disaster to
farmers as befell cotton growers for
example in 1914 15 
I would remind American farmers
o f these facts: This year s wheat
carry over is estimated at 254 million
bushels in comparison to 115 million
bushels for the five years from
1924 to 1928 
A slightly smaller production of
corn this year than last is expected 
but the present large carry over probably
will make the total 1939 40 supply
even larger than the 1938 39 supply
o f two billion nine hundred million
bushels 
Much o f the carry over o f both
corn and wheat is being held by farmers
under loan as part o f the evernormal
granary Through the granary 
in fact our carry over o f corn
has been increased from an average
o f less than 200 000 000 to over
450 000 000 bushels These added
supplies will be available for feeding
if the demand for pork and other livestock
products rises sharply in the
near future They remove the necessity
for increased planting that might
ultimately be ruinous Furthermore 
the com supply is a protection
against any food shortage that might
be caused by drought in 1940 or succeeding
years 
Supplies o f meat animals are expected
to be larger next year Inspected
slaughter o f hogs in 1939 
40 probably will be 7 million head
greater than during 1938 39 The total
number o f cattle on January 1 
1940 is expected to be about one
million head larger than a year earlier 
although the total slaughter for
1940 may be the same or slightly
smaller than for 1939 
Combined supplies o f cottonseed
oil lard and soybean oil available
for home consumption will be largeT
during the rest o f this year and 1940
than for 1938 
Continued heavy production o f
milk this fall is expected On August
1 cold storage holdings o f butter
were 35 000 000 pounds above the
1934 38 average Supplies o f rice 
canned fruit and fruit juices canned
vegetables potatoes and beans also
are substantially above normal or
prospective consumption 
The Ever normal Granary and the
stabilization of supplies o f meat and
mlik and eggs which it makes possible
serve also as a protection to the consumers
against exorbitantly high
prices 
Today we have a Commodity Exchange
Act In 1914 no such powers
were available for protecting producer
sand the public from excessive
market fluctuations and harmful
speculation 
Since 1933 in contrast to the
World War period farmers in almost
every county in the United States
Vave organized themselves for quick
action in dealing with problems of
production o f conservation o f credit 
and o f rural welfare These farmer
groups democratically elected to help
carry on the Agricultural Adjustment
Administration the Farm Security
Administration the Soil Conservation
Service the Bureau o f Agricultural
Economics all working in cooperation
with the State Extension Service 
have had invaluable experience
and training Whatever the demands
upon agriculture the organized
groups o f farmers now in existence
can move swiftly in co operation
with government to deal with
them For example the AAA committees
are eouipped to act quickly to
bring about either an increase or decrease
in production and to administer
whatever program o f action is
called for 
Not only are we organized better
in the field o f production; we have
also gained valuable experience and
improved organization in the marketing
field The marketing programs
for milk fruits and vegetables the
purchase and distribution programs 
and the food stamp plan can meet
the needs ahead much better than
they were met in 1914 There can
now be better planning more effective
farmer co operation and more
efficient results in whatever action
has to be taken 
These facts must convince farmers
that it will be possible to meet
all demands for farm products; that
it will be possible to avoid an overexpansion
o f our farm plant such as
occurred during the World War period
; and that it will be possible to
cushion the shocks o f the readjustment
which will be inevitable if the
present conflict continues over any
lengthy period and on any large scale 
So again I urge our farmers not
to be swayed by the developments
overseas Their greatest contributions
right now to their own welfare and
the national welfare is to carry on
just as before 
Henry s W ife: Dear did you notice
that Mrs Blank had another
new hat  
Henry dramatically: Yes darling 
but if she were as attractive as you
are she wouldn t have to depend so
much on millinery Ex

is in size and volume In each instance
the issue is who is going to get what
they want But the wars over seas are
upsetting our peace time plans and
programs Some think the upsetting
may mean prosperity for everybody
but the fighting nations while others
point to the experience o f twenty
years ago when everybody everywhere
went in to a great tailspin
called depression 
Commodity prices are on the jump 
and millions o f folks are trying to
avoid higher costs o f living by buying
heavily for future needs thus aiding
in bringing about the higher
prices they are seeking to escape for
themselves We folks o f the world are
so chock full o f the human nature
that in emergencies traveling in circles
becomes very common Two
* weeks ago the talk was about the
huge surpluses o f food stocks for instance 
The government was buying
and giving away food stuffs to relieve
those surpluses Also it was tapping
the pockets o f tax payers to subsidize
shipments o f wheat and cotton
to other countries which would not
buy them at our market prices Proclamations
were issued warning farmers
to cut down production for next
year Now our big city cousins are
fairly loading up their larders in the
fear that our surpluses may turn into
shortages Certainly nobody is going
to eat more at meal time because rival
armies are burning up the wealth
o f Europe to determine which country
has the biggest cannon and the
largest number o f them but that fact
does not allay the panic 
Sugar and flour seem to be in particular
demand for hoarding Some
house wives are said to be tucking
away 500 and 1000 pounds o f Cuban
cane stuffs Others are buying less 
But the speculators are harvesting
plenty o f dollars as prices advance 
There s plenty o f raw sugar more o f
a surplus than our country could use
up in a year if no more was produced 
but the buying spree has taken
up so much refined sugar that the
refineries are working night and day
to supply the demand 
We have been told over and over
again for months that there is wheat
enough on hand to make at least 75 
000 000 more barrels o f flour than
our people can possibly eat in a year 
That is why we sent 3 000 000 bushals
to warring Spain as a Red Cross
gift to save the starving children 
while 5 000 000 more bushels were
sold at a discount to be hauled over to
Germany and stored away Still the
rush for flour has cleaned out the
stocks o f thousands of groceries and
bakeries claim they can t obtain their
regular supplies Some flour mills
have had to reduce the volume o f
their out put because o f a lack of
wheat supplies temporarily suspended
because speculators are holding back
wheat in anticipation o f much higher
prices It s a grand world to live in 
sometimes because it s so interesting
when something upsets the ordinary
trend 
The cause for advance in costs is
rather remote in many instances The
big boat companies on the Great
Lakes ordinarily anxious to obtain
larger grain shipments at this season
o f the year have suddenly advanced
their freight rates on grain Their
explanation is that the eastern steel
mills are booming business in manufacturing
steel for war purposes and
the shipping lines can obtain higher
rates for hauling ore to the furnaces
from the iron mines o f Minnesota 
hence the extra charge for carrying
western grain The steel mills are
working over time on war supplies 
nothwithstanding the president s proclamation
that we are going to be
neutral and not ship war materials
abroad to fighting nations Seemingly 
that proclamation should have slowed
down steel production making less
ore necessary serving to reduce shipping
rates on ore and also on grains 
but things are not working out that
way Anybody has a right to figure
out their own solution as to the whys
and why nots even the lake shippers
who have advanced their rates

POINT MILITARY ACADEMY
The U S Civil Service Commission
will hold an examination at the
government post office building Eau
Claire Wisconsin at 9 o clock a m 
Saturday October 7 1939 for those
desiring to be appointed as cadets at
the United States Military Academy 
West Point New York 
There will be two vacancies to be
filled from the ninth congressional
district o f Wisconsin in the West
Point Militapr Academy 
The examination to be held on October
7th as above stated will afford
a preliminary test o f those desiring to
be candidates for cadets The appointment
will be made from the eligible
list obtained from the examination 
The regular mental and physical examinations
o f the academy will not
be held until the appointment is made 
Applicants for appointment to the

least one year beyond the high school

Criticism o f profiteeering and
objections to price advances is plentiful 
When the Department o f Agriculture
chips in its guess that the
price o f farm products has advanced
a billion dollars or more in ten days 
the eastern press wants congress
called into session at once to pass a
law The stock speculators have
pushed up prices on the stock exchanges
to the tune o f several billion
dollars the big banks furnishing 75
per cent o f the money for the boom 
The same eastern press boasts o f the
advance o f stocks in Wall street as
a big business revival but fails to
ask congress to pass a law to stop
that Possibly if we all were wiser 
we could get a lot o f fun in watching
our own inconsistencies but why seek
so much wisdom when we can get
just as much fun out o f noting the
inconsistencies o f others 
The president has been holding up
his call for a special session o f congress 
but states that one will be held 
The call may come any day and senators
and congressmen are unable to
plan their recess activities beyond a
few days ahead The principal reason
fo r the call will be to obtain the repeal
o f the embargo provisions in the
neutrality law thus opening our ports
to the foreign countries which want
to buy further supplies for destruction 
Some allege that a poll o f congress
is being taken to ascertain in
advance what the vote will be on the
proposition It is rather doubtful that
such a movement is underway Th 
eastern munition plants are preparing
to open up their branch factories in
other parts o f the country many o f
which have been closed since the close
o f the World war While it may be
questioned at the President will sound
out members on their attitude before
asking them back to Washington one
cannot help but wonder if the powder
and bullet makers have been busy in
such manner before getting busy with
the expansion o f their factories

Last week Main street from the
river bridge to the court house corner 
and Water street from Main to
Town Creek were given a surface
coating o f heavy oil and sand When
these streets were paved some 24
years ago concrete mixing and laying
was not the fine art it is at the
present time In some places the surface
o f the concrete has become rough
with the heavy traffic and hard freezing 
The mixture of heavy oil and
sand makes an effective and a quite
durable covering where ever placed
and will materially lengthen the life
of the paving 
Mr and Mrs Oscar Halvrson went

Before the World war our regular
army was about the smallest standing
army in the world When it was increased
to 50 000 folks back home
wanted to know about it Our army
still is small compared to those of
other countries It now numbers 210 
000 Our naval forces have alsc
grown in size and 110 000 men are
required to man our fleets with also
18 500 marines The president has issued
an order adding 17 000 more
men to the army 35 000 more to the
navy and 7 500 to the marine forces
Recruiting these additional forces will
start at once and nearly 60 000 recruits
will be added to the several
armed forces 
Secretary Wallace combats the cry
against increased prices for farm products 
and states that they are still
far too low to make farming profitable 
The whole program from the
days o f Hoover s Farm Board ha 
been to put farmers on a better level
and restore agriculture to a parity
with industry Billions have been
spent for that very purpose The advance
thus far has brought no farm
product to a parity price On the
other hand the great advance in the
prices o f other commodities probably
has prevented the farmers obtaining
much additional buying power from
such increases as have occurred

CURB AND GUTTER WORK
Last week end work commenced
at laying the curb and gutters along
the frontage o f all o f the lots in the
new Mills sub division There are 15
lots and it will require 1 500 feet o f
curb and gutter to complete the job 
The city is doing the work on the usual
basis as such work has been done
elsewhere in the city 
These lots have been platted on
what is generally referred to and
what is best known as The Dick
O Heam place although it is nearly
33 years since Mr O Hearn disposed
o f the property During the palmy
days o f lumbering Mr O Heam erected
a fine residence on the knoll near
the center o f the nearly five acre
tract For years next to the Price
residence it was the show place of
the city It was destroyed by five
several years ago Later Ed Mills acquired
the property and the platting
has been done according to his idea
o f what ideal residence lots should
be 
A new street North Ninth Street
Court runs from Harrison street
with a curve to near the center o f the
tract where it ends in a circle 100
feet in diameter the street being 55
feet wide Eight o f the lots have
frontage on this court four on Harrison
street and five on North Tenth
street two being corner lots TTie
curb and gutter will be laid all
around the court along the north
side o f Harrison and the east side o f
North Tenth streets 
Mr and Mrs Vem Button are building
the first residence in the subdivision
and the basement walls are
finished Several other fine new
homes appear to be assured on lots
there within the next year 
Chris Olson Chas Aldra and Will
Winter whose home is in Milwaukee 
went trout fishing on the south fork
o f Levis creek the last day o f the
open trout season The result was the
finest mess o f trout brought into
Black River Falls for several years 
After trying in vain to get trout angling
with worms flies and grasshoppers
they resorted to small live minnows
and how those trout did bite!
Seventeen were taken in a little over
an hour s time and not one o f them
was under 10 inches in length running
from that to one o f 16 inches 
They were remarkably uniform in
size and attracted much attention
when shown Mr Winter took the
trout with him to Milwaukee that
night

JACKSON COUNTY HAS A
N YA PROJECT
Jackson county has a National
Youth Administration unit established
last Thursday by Le Roy G Trowbridge 
district stipervisor o f Menomonie 
Mrs Esther Peterson is in
charge o f the office which is located
on the top floor o f the new court
house unit 
On June 26 1935 President Roosevelt
said: I have determined that
we shall do something for the nation s
unemployed youth because we
can ill afford to lose the skill and energy
o f these young men and women 
They must have their chance in school
and their turn as apprentices and
their opportunity for jobs a chance
to work and earn for themselves 
The objectives o f the National
Youth Administration is:
A To provide further educational
opportunities to needy high school 
college and graduate students;
B Part time employment on work
projects for the out of school youth
who has not yet found his place in
industry;
C Guidance and counselling on
the educational and vocational prob
lems o f youth 
Since the start o f this movement
representatives have visited Black
River Falls several times trying to
have a unit established here Recently
the county judge s office has
been interested and the establishment
o f the unit is the result 
All county youth this means girls
as well as boys from ages o f 18
to 25 years who are interested 
should interview Mrs Peterson at the
office and she will give them full instructions
what procedure to take 
While youth will be assisted to procure
private employment no financial
responsibility will be incurred unless
the youth are given employment on
some public project The unit will
continue indefinitely in charge o f
Mrs Peterson 
Miss Helen Thomasgaard o f the
high school faculty was taken ill

RELICS OF FLOOD DUG UP
Work on the W PA project which
put in the sewer and water main
connecting the fourth ward with this
side o f the river was carried on during
the winter months under considerable
difficulty as there was high
water every day and building under
the river was not such a snap as it
might have proved during the past
weeks when the water was so low 
They constructed a coffer dam and
continued their work finally crossing
and connecting with the other side 
George Northup was foreman o f the
job The last step was to connect
with the main sewer at the corner of
Water and Main street and during
the work o f excavating many interesting
articles lost since the flood of
1911 were unearthed 
A marble table top knives and
meat saws from the famous old Adam
Best meat shop were identified by
John Carisch who worked in the
shop They were taken over to John
Best brother o f the late Adam whp
lives at the Odey home The marble
top table was broken in digging the
sewer but apparently was in first
class condition 
Other interesting articles were an
Osborn hay tedder on which the paint
still showed the name plainly It was
from the storage house o f F B Dell
and Abe Benson who were in the
implement business at that time and
stored their machinery where the
Wadham station now stands Dell 
Benson also bought blueberries and
made berry boxes upstairs 
Other treasures unearthed were
two rifles and a considerable quantity
o f ammunition thought to be
from Tollack s hardware store dozens
o f bundles o f hack saws with the
string still on the bundles 
Among other articles were a disk 
two scoop shovels a bottle o f champagne
and across the river o f the
east side a bottle o f 188 proof alcohol 
both as good or as bad as ever 
One can imagine the many souvenirs
that could be found in that section
when one small trail o f a sewer
unearths so many things 
The old water main crosses the
river just below the dam The new
one that crosses a short distance
above the new river bridge is an
eight instead o f four inch and includes
the sewer 
The crew is now working on a project
extending the eight inch main to
the Jackson Box factory

IN MEMORIAM
For our baby girl Marcella May
Simplot who passed away two years
ago Sept 3 1937 
Nothing but memories as we journey
on
Longing for a smile from a baby who
has gone 
None knew the depth o f our deep regrets 
But we remember where others forget 
It is not the tear at the moment shed
That tells how beloved is the soul
that has fled 
But tears through many a long night
wept
And loving remembrance lonely kept 
Sadly missed by her parents Mr 
and Mrs Art Simplot and five brothers 
grandparents aunts and uncles

SAFETY
While Death s main theatre o f operations
seems to be in Europe at
the present time the grim reaper is
taking its toll o f traffic victims in
Wisconsin 
The State Highway commission reported
the official list o f traffic dead
for last month at 59 and the toll for
the first eight months o f the year at
399 
Five more counties were erased
from the state s safety honor roll in
August because o f automobile deaths
 Ashland Bayfield Crawford Vilas
and Marinette Not only six o f Wisconsin s
71 counties have succeeded
in keeping Death from snatching the
lives o f any o f their motorists or pedestrians 
Burnett Kewaunee Lafayette 
Pepin Taylor and Trempealeau
Of the 59 persons killed in August
traffic 12 were pedestrians the highway
commission points out This
brings the number of walkers killed
during the first two thirds o f the year
1939 to 101 
Counties having pedestrian deaths
last month were Ashland Clark 
Dane Kenosha Milwaukee Outagamie 
Sauk Sheboygan Vernon and
Wood Only two o f the walkers were
women 10 men or boys 
Pedestrians over 60 bore the brunt
o f the attack against those on foot 
Two were in their 80 s three in their
70 s and three in their 60 s Two
youths nine and 12 died 
Eight walkers were killed while
crossing city streets in Appleton 
Baraboo Kenosha Madison Milwaukee 
Sheboygan and Viroqua Four
were struck down fatally on highways 
in Ashland Clark Dane and
Wood counties

Post No 200
With things getting pretty well
steamed up across Commander
Chadwick has taken a strong stand
for neutrality In a letter to Secretary
o f State Cordell Hull he states
 The die has been cast in Europe 
May I repeat my assurance to you
o f last Fall anything that I can
do either in my official capacity or
as an individual to keep America
from the malestrom I stand ready
to do My prayers are with you 
* * *
And on another occasion: A
state o f war has existed at some
place in this troubled world almost
every day since the World war 
The American Legion for the entire
period o f its existence has
counselled the nation to a policy
o f neutrality to the end that we
may not again become involved in
another holocaust seemingly as futile
for the ultimate peace o f Europe
as was our participation in
the World war

CONSERVATION NOTES
James A Corcoran Webster 
chairman o f the conservation commission 
has wired Conservation Director
H W MacKenzie an outline for a
drive on noxious weeds to assure this
state as a haven for hay fever sufferers 
The campaign is to be carried
on through the cooperation o f the
forestry board of the Conservation
Department and the Civilian Conservation
corps 
Mr Corcoran s telegram follows:
 As you will recall I have discussed
the noxious weed situation in Wisconsin
which is causing a great deal o f
discomfort to a great many o f our
citizens who are afflicted with hay
rever 
 As the forestry board will meet
very soon I have written to Mr Anderson 
director o f CCC camps requesting
him to cooperate with the
department in the extermination o f
these weeds I believe that the department
will have full cooperation
o f every citizen in the state in giving
relief to those affected by hay fever
and in time will bring many citizens
from other states who are seeking relief
from the hay fever disease to
spend the months o f August and September
in Wisconsin 
 Will you kindly urge the members
o f the forestry board to give
the cooperation necessary in setting
up machinery under CCC guidance
to exterminate noxious weeds in this
state 
Hunting Season
Hunting regulations for 1939 are
now definitely established Unless
something unforseen happens within
the next few weeks the upgrade o f
the cycle on native Wisconsin game
o f many species two successive mild
winters and favorable nesting and
rearing seasons together with the
most comprehensive stocking program
in the United States will give Wisconsin
its best upland game hunting
in many years The 1939 hunting regulations
have been fixed accordingly

include a fourth consecutive season
on white tailed deer in 30 northern

 A LETTER TO THE HUNTERS 1

River Falls Gun Skeet Club has decided to hold a Hunter s Special Shooting
Program This will give the hunters of this vicinity an oportunity to compete
against shooters of like ability 
The tremendous turnout 229 shooters at the State Hunter s Special this spring
fully justifies the Gun Club s prediction and hopes as to the hunters response
It showed that the beginner and hunter enjoys competition as well as the crack
shots of the game Many shooters have begun to ask when they will have another
shoot Women and Juniors were entered and did a fine job 
The Gun and Skeet Club is endeavoring to make this shoot the biggest in Central
Wisconsin s history and will spare no effort The entry fee has been cut as
low as possible and the estimated profits returned as trophies 
W e invite you to this shoot and to our grounds at any time W e shoot every
Sunday morning and if we can help you in your shooting we will be glad to do

DRIVERS CLINIC TESTS
Nearly 3500 visitors to the Wisconsin
State Fair took drivers clinic
tests more than double the number
who went through the clinic last year
the State Highway Commission announced 
Jackson county was represented
at the clinic by one person 
Tests actually were given to 3 420
persons for brake reaction time eyehand 
steering co ordination color
blindness resistance to headlight
glare and general vision deficiency 
The clinic was sponsored by the State
Highway Commission cooperating
with the Milwaukee County Safety
commission and the county safety
councils 
Last year 1603 motorists went thru
the clinic This year 1125 persons
from the city o f Milwaukee alone
spent from 15 minutes to a half hour
each discovering how they rated in
comparison with the average driver
on Wisconsin highways Each person
discussed his record with a clinic operator
who analyzed his scores and
advised on how to overcome driving
difficulties revealed by the tests 
Sixty o f Wisconsin s 71 counties
were represented the highway commission

CORNMEAL BATH
CLEANS WOOLENS
Cornmeal is almost as good for dry
cleaning as it is for johnny cake 
Maybe you have a light colored 
knit wool suit or a sweater that has
begun to look a bit dingy Try
grandmother s method for cleaning it
 a bath o f cornmeal suggests Miss
Cecelia Abry o f the University o f
Wisconsin home economics department 
Cornmeal is one o f those
homely old time dry cleaning materials
that was discovered by homemakers
years ago but it s still going
strong 
 Spread the cornmeal over the
garment and rub it in explains the
home economist Then brush off the
meal The cornmeal absorbs the
grease or oil and when it s brushed
off the dirt goes with it 
There s another way to clean with
cornmeal too Put your light woolen
garment in a big bag or a pillow
slip Then shake in a generous
amount o f cornmeal draw up the
bag and shake it thoroughly so the
meal will reach every inch o f the
garment Next take the garment
out put fresh meal on the more soiled
spots and rub them with your
hands Finally shake the meal off 
That s all there is to the cornmeal
bath 
 Of course this cleaning method
works only with light colored wool
clothes because the meal will show
against dark colors explains Miss
Abry Also it is most successful on
slightly soiled garments so be sure to
do the cleaning before your clothes
show too much o f the wear and tear
o f use 
CLEAR JELLIES ARE
GOAL OF HOMEMAKER
Clear shimmering mounds o f jelly
are the precious gems o f cookery 
For they add color sparkle and zest
to a meal 
Jellies are a disappointment to the
homemaker if they aren t clear Mrs 
Charlotte Clark Buslaff extension
nutritionist o f the University o f Wisconsin 
says there are several reasons
why jellies are cloudy or foggy 
Sirs Buslaff gives as the first reason
the fact that the juice may not be
properly clarified before making into
jelly She says it is much easier to
strain the juice if it is hot Pressing
the jelly bag containing the pulp
forces small portions o f the pulp
through and this makes the final
product foggy 
A second reason is that the jelly
may be cooked slightly beyond the
finish point If this is done the
product will be sticky and gummy 
and will not clear after pouring 
If the jelly is allowed to cool too
much before it is poured into glasses 
it becomes viscous and sometimes
lumpy the nutritionist points out 
The jelly is always cloudy 
The spout o f the pouring vessel
should never be more than an inch or
so above the top o f the jelly glass 
Mrs Buslaff cautions Because if
poured from too great a height large
quantities o f air are carried into the
jelly These escape with difficulty if
at all in a well made jelly 
A fruit that is too green will give
a cloudy appearance For green
fruits contain starch and this does
not dissolve according to the nutritionist 
Then finally there may be too
much pectin Mrs Buslaff explains If
this is so the pectin may settle out or
may not be dissolved and the jelly
will not be clear

It is so natural that we fall asleep 
Like tired children when the day is

When death has kissed the living lips

have donned
The purple shadows and the gray of
the night 
Because we know the morning lies
beyond
And we must wait a little while for
light * * *

 MEMORIES THAT BLESS 
The Banner Journal is in receipt of
a beautifully bound copy o f a book 
 Memories That Bless recently published
by Amalia Caroline Baird of
Eau Claire It is a little volume in
tribute to the memory o f her good
mother Mrs Caroline Oulie Olson 
who is fondly remembered by many
old friends in the Trempealeau Valley 
It is wonderfully written and
the daughter has combined with her
expression o f love and devotion to
her mother s memory a literary gem
which will long serve as a model of
what a memorial volume can be in
true heartfelt interest 
Mrs Baird wife o f Dr J C Baird 
prominent Eau Claire physician is a
daughter o f the late Hon and Mrs 
George Olson who were residents o f
the Taylor community for many
years living on a fine farm south o f
the village In their advanced years
they went back to childhood scenes
in Norway where they spent the remainder
o f their lives Mr Olson
was a very active man and o f great
ability He was a successful traveling
salesman and business man He
devoted much time to religious activities
and he had a warm interest in
politics He served as member o f the
Wisconsin Assembly from this county
in 1899 Mrs Baird in her volume
relates stories of family life and incidents
and includes photos o f several
members o f the family and home
scenes A double page photo of the
Olson homestead near Taylor is shown
on the cover and opening page 
Mrs Baird has so well written it
that all who read it will find interest
in the skillful manner in which she
has interwoven her recollection o f the
events o f her earlier years wTith her
affectionate tribute 
Mrs Baird familiarly known to
many Jackson county friends as
 Amalia Olson still seems a part of
our county life after an absence o f
years After finishing her education
and training course she became superintendent
o f the Luther hospital
at Eau Claire She was very successful
in that work and the hundreds
o f Jackson county folks who were
patients there during her superintendency
wiil always recollect her as a
ministering angel one whose heart
was wrapped up in her devotion to
them 
The publishers o f Memories That
Bless have included a cover piece
with a photo o f Mrs Baird in her
home it Eau Claire A brief biographical
sketch appears on this
cover which we reproduce It will
be o f much interest to our readers:
 Memories That Bless is a magnificent
tribute to all motherhood and
will touch a responsive chord in the
hearts o f all readers 
It is written with deep sincerity
and the heartfelt appreciation o f a
daughter who has watched the changing
midwestern scene with keen and
intelligent eyes 
The author Mrs Joseph C Baird 
was born in Chicago but lived on a
farm in Wisconsin during her childhood 
The death o f one sister and four
brothers during the family s stay in
Chicago due to contagious diseases
that were uncontrollable in the cities
at that time prompted the parents to
seek the clean open air o f the country
to rear the remainder o f their
little flock 
It was this move that developed all
o f the great latent abilities o f the
mother in this story 
Mrs Baird s academic training included
a special course in art and
music which was originally intended
to prepare her for her life s vocation
but she became interested in charitable
work instead and entered the
Lutheran Deaconess Hospital o f Chicago
where she received her three
year nursing course taking up an additional
course in hospital management
before coming to her present
location Eau Claire Wisconsin She
was Luther Hospital s Superintendent
and director of its nursing school for
thirteen years Ten o f these years
were devoted to the deaconess cause 
She is married to a physician and 
though a homemaker is still keenlyinterested
in public health work as
evidenced by her recent appointment
to the Wisconsin State Board o f
Health the first lay person to be so
honored 
This is Mrs Baird s first publication
in book form although she has
written numerous articles on various
subjects especially in the field o f
public health In her home city she
is well known as a clubwoman and
takes an active part in all civic and
club events 
RYE SOWN NOW FOR PASTURE
IS BIG CORN PROTEIN
SUPPLEMENT SAVER
The time is rapidly approaching
when rye may be sown for fall and
early spring hog pasture observes E 
L Quailfe extension service animal
husbandman at Iowa State College 
Two or three acres o f good rye
pasture will furnish pasture for 20 to
25 gilts during the fall and will provide
early pasture for the sows and
their litters next spring 
Quailfe says that the greatest value
in a rye pasture comes in the spring 
Such a pasture would be reasonably
clean ground for the sows and little
pigs to run upon when other pastures
might not be available or the hog
lots muddy 
The amount o f grain saved by a
rye pasture and its contribution to
health and faster gains are very important 
At the Illinois Experiment
Station one acre o f rye pasture saved
approximately 1Q0 bushels o f corn
and 560 pounds of protein supplement 
In this test the hogs were put
on the pasture April 4 and had access
to it for a period o f 36 days The
sows on the rye pasture actually gained
in weight while suckling the pigs
and the pigs gained faster and ate
less feed than the pigs suckling other
sows kept in a dry lot 
After a rye pasture begins to shoot
heads it had better be plowed and
put to corn or soybeans suggests
Quaife Seldom does it pay to let
rye mature for grain The same piece
o f ground might be used the next fall
as rye pasture 
Quaife recommends sowing about
six pecks to the acre any time from
now until late fall The earlier it is
sown however the more fall feed
there will be Rye is sometimes sown
broadcast in the corn in late August
and is harrowed in by dragging brush
or a light harrow between the rows

COUNTY W IDE CONSERVATION
DISTRICTS
Erosion control programs are going
to be simplified 
Procedure under which Jackson
and other counties may act in setting
up erosion control programs has
been made easier by a revision of the
state soil conservation law which has
just passed the legislature and which
has been approved by the governor 
This is the announcement made by
Warren F Clark associate director
o f agricultural extension at the Wisconsin
College o f Agriculture 
Clark explains that the county
board now has power to declare the
county a soil conservation district 
He points out that this authority is
given the county board in counties
where soil erosion is clearly a public
problem and where land owners are
substantially in favor o f establishing
such a district 
Under the changed law the process
o f organizing districts is speeded up 
he said Formerly farmers wanting
to take advantage o f the assistance
which the law provided were compelled
to go through a tedious and costly
organization process involving
sometimes more than a year s time 
The revision eliminates the need for
holding preliminary hearings for
holding referendums for filing nominating
petitions and for electing supervisors 
Administration and soil conservation
districts created under the
changed law will be carried on by
county agricultural committees acting
as a board o f supervisors Clark indicated 
Where such a committee does
not exist the county board is directed
to create one 
Provision is made for continuing
those districts which have already
been established under the original
1937 law Clark reported He explained
that these areas were not set
up on a county basis and that in some
cases one district may include parts
o f two or more counties Six such
districts are already organized and
carrying on erosion control programs 
Four others are in the process o f organizing 
Districts included entirely in one
county will became a part o f their
county district whenever that is established 
he said A district extending
through more than one county
will continue as it is until all o f the
counties in which it lies become organized
districts It will then be dissolved 
Other changes in the 1937 law include
enlarging the state soil conservation
committee from two to three
farmer members Present members
are George Nygaard Chaseburg and
Paul Weis Barnum Clark as director
o f the agricultural extension
service and Noble Clark director of
the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment
Station are members ex officio 
Tracing the history o f the state soil
conservation law Clark indicated that
originally the federal Soil Conservation
Service through demonstration
projects had provided assistance to
individual farmers This aid took the
form o f laying out fields on contour
lines and for strip cropping controlling
gullies reforesting steep hillsides 
and similar activities 
Then a ruling by the Secretary of
Agriculture confined such activities
to districts or areas having governmental
authority to cooperate in erosion
control and to direct soil conservation
programs he said Since
no such districts existed in Wisconsin
the ruling automatically barred the
starting o f any new demonstration
projects in the state 
To meet this situation the 1937
soil conservation law was passed by
the state legislature he continued 
Under it machinery for setting up
soil conservation districts was established 
It also enabled farmers where
such districts were created to continue
getting assistance from the Soil
Conservtaion Service 
The Upper Pigeon Creek Soil Conservation
District which includes
Northfield township and parts o f
Curran Garden Valley Cleveland
and several sections in Trempealeau
county is one o f the six districts now
in operation

SPEEDY CANNING
BEST FOR GREENS
Canning vegetables in season 
helps save money time and energy
during the out o f season months 
It s easier to plan and prepare winter
meals when we have a generous
supply o f canned foods 
Greens such as beet tops Swiss
chard and spinach are especially valuable
vegetables to can believes Mrs 
Charlotte Clark Buslaff extention nutritionist
at the Wisconsin College of
Agriculture because they are such a
good source o f minerals and vitamins 
The greener the leafy vegetable
is o f coursefi the greater is the
amount o f vitamins it contains 
 Choose only fresh young greens
for canning advises Mrs Buslaff 
 and throw away the imperfect leaves
and tough stems Wash the greens
carefully in running water or thru
a number o f waters lifting the vegetables
out each time Add hot water
to the greens and cook in an uncovered
kettle for five minutes or until
the greens are wilted 
 Then for the best results work
very quickly Pack the hot greens
to make the pack too solid Making
a hole with two or three turns o f a
knife in the center o f each can will
help keep the pack loose Then add
one teaspoon o f salt for each quart
o f the vegetable and cover with the
water left from cooking the greens 
The greens and liquid should come to
within one half an inch o f the top
o f the jar Put the covers on the jars
and process at 250 degrees F or 15
pounds pressure Under this temperature
or pressure the pint glass jars
need to be processed 60 minutes and
the quart ones require 65 minutes 
Mrs Buslaff counts the time of
processing from the moment the desired
pressure is reached A t the end
o f this time the canner is taken from
the fire and allowed to cool until
the pressure registers zero Then the
petcock is opened and the cover o f
the canner is gradually taken off 
Finally remove the glass jars one at
a time and seal them tightly at once

a pupil should be encouraged to do
well in one activity rather than dabbling
in many 
The publishers Foreword declares
 In Extra class Activities we herewith
present a veritable gold mine o f
tips and suggestions for extra curricular
activities Actual experience over
a number o f years in sponsoring club
activities has made these authors to
list practical suggestions for small
schools as well as large schools 
 The authors recognize that extra 
class activity must o f necessity
vary according to size location and
local circumstances hence they have
sought diligently to make this outline
as comprehensive as convenient brevity
will permit 
 My wife always gets historical
when I stay out late at night 
 Hysterical you mean 
 No historical She digs up all
my past Ex 
Marcella Gill Relyea
Last week was a history making
week one whose dates will be written
on millions o f hearts with indelible
ink Through the wondrous medium
o f radio we have all listened to and
been abel to visualize the events that
led up to this new war and already
we have had the horror and sorrow
of it brought home to us in a hundred
ways Though we may have longed
to give Mr Chamberlain a boost in
the right direction and have cried
out with irritation against his cautions
and mistakes we know a pang
o f sympathy for him when he made
his declaration o f a state o f war 
and said that all he had hoped and
planned for lay about him in ruins 
Our hatred o f the very name Hitler
grew as we heard how by vicious propaganda
and twisted facts he has se it
an essentially peace loving people
into a war they had no desire to
fight; and we listen to each new
bulletin with a grim hope that somewhere
waits a man who will send an
assassin s bullet into this mad man
before the whole world is plunged
into war Evil thoughts these for
peaceful and ordinary people but the
things we hear and read are evil too 
Could any one listen to the description
o f the evacuation o f London s
children and visualize the mothers
standing so bravely while inside their
hearts were ready to burst and not
long to get a whack at Hitler himself 
The democracies today seem
like a big family When there was
peace they squabbled continuously
over religion politics a hundred issues 
But in time o f crisis like the
brothers and sisters in a large and
quarrelsome group they dropped the
petty problems and drew together in
complete unity and accord God grant
that the struggle be short and the
victory lasting 
Mrs Alvin Relyea had an exciting
experience recently She and Mr 
Relyea drove to Minneapolis to take
in the State Fair and also to attend
a 7 o clock broadcast from WCCO 
one o f those laughable quarter hours
presided over by Clelland Card She
had the good luck to be one o f four
chosen from an audience o f 500 persons 
and to come up to the mike 
answer several questions and be kidded
by the irrepressable Mr Card 
She received half a bushel o f hybrid
seed com as a prize and reports that
the experience was thoroughly enjoyable 
despite the shaky state o f her
knees!
The next time you roast beef try
adding a cup or two o f tomato juice
instead o f water (this would mean a
pan roast o f course) The gravy will
have a delicious flavor yet the tomato
color and taste can scarcely be
detected 
Here are two more recipes from
Leona Paulley o f Black River Falls:
Spinach Loaf
1 can cooked spinach or other
greens
 lb hamburger
3 eggs may be omitted
1 cup bread crumbs
Salt and pepper to taste
Mix into loaf roll in cracker
crumbs Steam one hour Brown in
the oven 
Apple Fritters
Core and peel 3 or 4 apples Be
careful not to break them Cut in
slices one third inch thick leaving a
hole in the center Dip in fritter batter
and fry in hot fat If you desire 
dip slices in lemon juice spices
and sugar before dipping in batter 
A fter frying drain and sprinkle with
powdered sugar 
Fritter Batter:
2 egg yolks well beaten
Vi cup milk or water
1 tsp olive oil
Vi tsp salt
Flour to make o f batter consistency 
Add beaten egg whites last 
If for fruit add 1 tsp sugar if for
meat add 1 tsp lemon juice or vinegar 
This will keep several days 
Try cooking celery parsnips or salsify 
cutting in pieces and frying in
this batter

GREEN W ATER IN
THE BLACK RIVER
For the past few weeks the Black
river water running down the toil
race and that has been all o f it has
been as decidedly green in color as it
ever is black Many persons when
crossing the river bridge have noticed
it and wondered why it should be so 
The green color is caused by algea
plant organisms developing in still
water during warm weather That it
should be so much worse this year
than ever before is probable due to
the absence o f hard rains causing
freshets in the streams A good hard
rain with three or four o f the dam
gates open for a few days would
soon remedy the trouble in the Black
river 
In some places the conditions have
been very much worse the stench
from the decaying algea being almost
unbearable Although the rainfall
for the past five months has not been
much below normal the rain has come
down easily and there has been much
less than the usual amount o f run off 
We are indebted to the local Ranger
station for the interesting data on
rainfall 
The following is the 28 year average:
April 2 54 in 
May 3 94 in 
June 4 42 in 
July 3 58 in 
August 3 44 in 
Total 17 90 in 
The following is the rainfall for
1939:
April 2 81 in 
May 1 76 in 
June 4 42 in 
July 2 31 in 
August 5 48 in 
Total 16 78 in 
Most rainfall this year fell on August
20th 3 8 inches

About 100 000 barrels o f cranberries
are expected to be produced in
the state this year If present estimates
materialize the crop this year
will be 36 000 barrels larger than
that o f 1938 and 40 000 barrels above
average The berries are reported to
be large this year and the harvesting
season is a week to ten days earlier
than usual 
Cranberry production in the United
States is expected to be about a
third larger than a year ago and
about 5 per cent above average Crop
conditions vary in the five states
producing cranberries 
The Massachusetts growers report
smaller berries than usual for this
time o f the year Worm damage in
that state is expected to be light The
New Jersey crop is estimated to be
larger than a year ago but below average
because o f damage by rains
during August Washington and
Oregon expect to harvest slightly
smaller crops than last year but
these crops will be well above average

B R FALLS MERCHANTS
VS HOUSE OF DAVID
What promises to be one o f the
best ball games o f the season will be
fought out at the local ball grounds
Thursday night when the Israelite
House o f David meets the home team 
Weather permitting the fans who
were so bitterly disappointed Monday
when inclement weather spoiled the
long looked for game between the
Merchants and the Trempealeau Co 
All Stars will see a game that will
make them forget Monday afternoon 
This traveling base ball team has
been in Black River Falls many times
during the past few years and have
given all who witnessed their play
genuine satisfaction that no further
introduction is necessary At the
close o f a successful season they are
in the pink o f condition and are able
and willing to do their best The
team has a reputation for hard honest 
conscientious playing at all times
and under all circumstances They
will play just that way Thursday
night 
The Merchants have given Black
River Falls the best base ball team it
ever had this season They are one
o f the very best o f the semi professional
teams o f Wisconsin and they
have held their own several times
this summer with teams that really
were professional Such a team o f
clean cut young men who can play
ball as they can and do is worthy o f
all the encouragement our citizens
can give them The base ball fans
have backed them right royally all
season 
These two teams have met so often
on the diamond that there is a keen
but friendly rivalry between them 
Such a feeling is sufficient assurance
that the game Thursday night will
be worth seeing Each team will
play to win and each team has an
enviable reputation for playing clean
as well as brilliant base ball The
base ball season is nearing its close
for this year and a good crowd will
be out to see the Black River Falls
Merchants trounce the House o f David

TIMOTHY SEED PRODUCTION
SMALLER THAN LAST YEAR
Timothy seed production in Wisconsin
as well as for the United
States will be considerably below that
o f a year ago according to the Crop
Reporting Service o f the Wisconsin
and United States Departments o f
Agriculture 
Estimates for Wisconsin show that
about 24 000 bushels o f timothy seed
will be produced in the state this
year This production will be about
14 per cent below the 28 000 bushels
of timothy seed harvested in the state
last year 
The acreage o f timothy hay saved
for seed in Wisconsin this year is estimated
at 6 900 acres compared with
9 800 acres reported a year ago A ccording
to reports from growers in
the state the yield per acre will average
3 5 bushels compared with 2 9
bushels in 1938 
The production o f timothy seed in
the United States is expected to be
about one sixth smaller than the crop
harvested last year and less than
three fourths the size o f the 10 year
average production Estimates show
that the nation s timothy seed production
will be 1 244 000 bushels o f
thresher run seed compared with 1 
494 500 bushels harvested last year 
and 1 713 730 reported as the 10 
year average The decreased production
is chiefly because o f the smaller
yields per acre this year the
acreage is only about 5 per cent
smaller than estimated for 1938 
Wisconsin timothy seed prices o ffered
to growers about August 1 averaged
$4 20 per 100 pounds basis
clean seed and the average for the
nation is reported at $3 45 per 100
pounds o f seed The average price
offered farmers in the nation last
year was $2 60 per 100 pounds and
the 5 year average price is $5 00

Important Statement from
A P about WAR DAYS
AND FOOD PRICES
A P S policy will remain unchanged That policy is simply this: A P
will provide good food at lowest prices possible As always we will
operate our stores and markets with the interests of our customers
constantly in mind We know the hardships that increased food prices
can bring to countless families therefore our prices will be adjusted
only to the extent that is absolutely necessary If owing to the laws
of supply and demand the prices for goods we purchase move upward
obviously we will have to pay the higher cost and charge retail prices
accordingly 
You have our assurance however that A P s margin of profit will
continue to be very small and normal in every respect 
Thus we pledge to you and 6 million loyal customers the best efforts
of our wide spread organization to keep our prices as low as sound
business judgment will permit 
We repeat A P s policy will be unchanged good foods at lowest
prices possible
