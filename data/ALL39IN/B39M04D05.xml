In the choice and development of
leisure-time activities or hobbies one
cannot begin too young Many a man
has spent his life with his nose to the
grindstone doing nothing but his
work and when the time comes to
let up and take it easier and retire 
he finds that he knows nothing to do
in the time his new-found leisure
forces upon him He has always imagined
that once sypplied with leisure 
interesting pastimes would spring
to hand at will But such is not the
case and he learns too iate that the
art of play must be acquired as the
art of work was acquired early and
gradually 
It is told that Calvin Coolidge was
such an individual that after he retired
from the Presidency he was a
lost man Back in his old home town
in Vermont he went early to his
office but there was nothing to do 
He went home again and there was
nothing to do He was sixty years
old and apparently had no engrossing
interest 
On the other hand there are many
people today leaders in the fields of
government business are and literature 
who do have absorbing leisure-
time pursuits For instance-our
Presidents interest in stamp collecting
and ship models and marine print
collecting is well known President
Roosevelt has one of the finest collections
o f ship models in the U nited
States Henry Ford the manufacturer 
collects early Americana The
ex-King Alfonso o f Spain collects
sporting trophies and to show his
sporting spirit he also collects momentoes
of the numerous attempts to
assassinate him King Boris o f Bulgaris
is a botanist George A Plimpton 
president of Ginn Company 
famous publishers of text books has
the most complete collection of school
books in the world Many busy and
important people find their recreation
in the field o f music Pierre S DuPont 
the munitions king plays the
pipe organ; Dr Albert Einstein the
violin; Ethel Barrymore the piano;
former Vice President Dawes the
flute; and you may recall that the
late W illiam Woodin President Roose
velts first Secretary of the Treasury 
not only played the violin guitar 
zither and cello but was also a composer
of music 
Perhaps the most piquant hobby
for a man is that o f the former King
of England Edward V III He knits
and crochets scarfs and mufflers He
acquired his skill from his royal
mother when he was a boy Now
he fills in odd moments o f his day
practicing a singularly restful diversion 
K nitting is really a sedative
in his nerve-frazzled age 
The above-mentioned hobbies are
suggestions for hobbies for people
who may not be in the limelight 
However the idea is not to do blindly
what others are doing but to find
your own special means of self-expression 
something that satisfies you
completely 
In order to escape a boresome old
age start preparing yourself now I f
you have not as yet begun the pursuit
of some all-absorbing hobby be
sure to visit the Hobby Show at the
high school auditorium April 21 22 
and 23 Perhaps there you may discover
the very thing you have been
looking for there the hobby of some
exhibitor may inspire you to follow a
similar one The point is that i f you
feel any desire to use your leisure
time and give it meaning in your life 
there is undoubtedly some activity
that you can follow with enough success
to experience a glow of achievement
and make you more interesting
to your friends as well as to yourself 
Just a word to those who are fortunate
enough to have a hobby: be
sure to exhibit it at the Hobby Show
in order that your work may be an
inspiration to those less fortunate
than you In this issue o f the Banner-
Journal you will find a classification
list and entry blank Fill in the entry
blank and send it to Mrs Grace
Sindelar Black River Falls High
school or phone the high school o ffice
and a member o f the social problems
class will call for it I f you
have several hobbies for exhibit additional
entry blanks may be obtained
from Mrs Sindelar or students 
Prepare now to exhibit your hobby!

Editors Note The following story
about logging on Black River as the
end was approaching is taken from
an edition of the Galesville Independent
which was printed in 1898 
The days o f the logging industry
on Black river are numbered The
supply of standing pine has been diminishing
year after year and now 
today a comparatively small portion
o fit remains Whole towns in Jackson 
Taylor and Clark counties 
which were once covered with pine
forests are now barren and desolate;
black pine stumps only remain 
Twenty or twenty-five years ago
the lumbering business on Black
river was in its prime Lumbering
camps dotted the whole o f the Black
river country Fully 2 500 men were
employed every year and from 68
until 81 these 2 500 men cut and
rolled into the river 200 000 000 feet
o f logs annually 
The lumbering industry was immense
there were millions in it Cities
and towns sprung up along the
Black and employment was offered to
all who came Every year about the
middle or first of November men
made their way  to the woods where
the winter days were spent in hard
work From 3 in the morning until
8 or 9 oclock the men toiled until
spring opened This has been going
on for 30 years but a halt will soon
come This year only 80 000 000
feet of logs will be taken out: while
the available amount of timber left is
only 225 000 000 feet This seems to
be a big lot but when one glances
back over the records and finds that
 B ill Price and his crew o f 500 men
cut and  drove down the Black in
one season 100 000 000 feet o f logs 
the remaining amount of pine seems
almost insignificant Bill was quite
a lumberman though and his seasons
work is considered a big one 
Lumbering on the Black is practically
over but the good old stream
has made thousands of men rich and
no less than a score o f millionaires 
Trow Bright Paine Birchard Elliot 
Brockway Nichols Mills and others
grew rich at  the Falls but the
bigger ones posted themselves at the
mouth o f the Black O f these the
most noted are Withee Coleman 
Gile Sawyer Austin and Washburn 
In getting rich these men as
 The Black River Improvement Co  
transformed the once deep beautiful
stream to a shallow river filled with
sandbars They have literally spoiled
the Black forever Cities and towns
now situated upon it are generally
dead It was a blessing that the founders
o f this city (Galesville) built the
first foundation two miles away from
the then beautiful stream

(L a Crosse Tribune)
Congressman Merlin H ull is asking
for an inquiry as to why there is discrimination
in the District o f Columbia
against milk from the middle
west 
The immediate cause of the request
of Congressman Hull is the detention
o f a truck driven bringing in 2 000
gallons o f cream from Indiana for
distribution in the District of Columbia
and the arrest o f the officers of
the milk concern importing the milk 
H ull is asking the whys and wherefores
for the action o f the health
authorities o f the District o f Columbia 
The congressman from Wisconsin
declares that the arrests in the District
o f Columbia for the attempted
importation o f the milk from the
middle west are but part and parcel
o f an effort to prevent competition in
the milk business 
The milk producers of Wisconsin
should support Congressman H ull in
his demands There is no question
that at present the officials of many
cities and some states are enforcing
discriminatory regulations to prevent
competition in local fluid milk markets
o f milk not produced in their immediate
vicinity 
Shipments of well inspected milk
from Wisconsin to eastern cities have
been held up in the past on the
charge that the inspection did not
comply with the local regulations of
the markets in which the milk was to
be sold 
The inquiry H ull proposes may
start something o f benefit to all milk
producers The charges Hull has presented
certainly indicate a rigid investigation
o f the whole milk situation
in this country would not be out
of place Milk under present pasteurization
and icing protection can
be shipped long distances for the sale
in markets other than the states in
which it is produced 
Open markets for all milk may not
be desirable but the regulations at
least should be uniform The milk
business has become inter-state in
practically all of its phases The
federal government has plenty of
right to make a thorough investigation 
I t is time also that the people
learn just what powers are controlling
the milk business and what influences
are used to create protected
markets

E arl Horswill president o f the
Jackson County Cooperative Advancement
Association recently wrote
to the Delta Cooperative farm for
information as to how the project
was progressing It will be remembered
that a young man from that
place gave a talk at the Methodist
church Mens club one time last year
and there was much interest in it 
The idea o f the farm grew out of
the pathetic condition of the average
sharecropper in that section His income
had been found to be hardly
$1 75 per person per month if distributed
over a family o f five He
was utterly dependent semi-illiterate
and hopeless The cooperative farm
was founded to remedy this condition 
I t consisted o f a tract o f 2 138
acres with five to six hundred cultivated 
The soil is Sharkey clay 
capable o f being brought to a high
state of production It is governed
and held by a board o f five trustees 
democratically elected Four foundation
principles set forth the aim of
the farm They are:
1 Efficiency in production and
economy in finance through the cooperative
principle 
2 Participation in the building of
a socialized economy of abundance 
3 The principle o f inter-racial
justice 
4 Realistic religion as a social dynamic 
The farm was established in the
summer o f 1936 It did well that
year repaid all loans for regular advances
and operating costs and made
a small payment on capital investment
and still had some money to divide as
a work dividend Their total earnings
for the year averaged $327 for
each individual or family Skilled
workers received more than unskilled
and some worked more hours than
others the amounts received were
not equal but pro-rated according to
time and skill They did not do so
well in 1937 due mainly to the low
price of cotton the principal cash
crop They expected to break even
for 1938 paying advances and operating
costs in full with nothing over
for capital investment or work dividend 
So much for the financial side The
farm itself has grown and activities
expanded They have cleared land as
rapidly as possible now having 450
acres in cultivation in the first farm 
The garden and cannery have been
improving each year They discontinued
the poultry department which
was operating at a loss The dairy
grew to 12 cows which with seven
or eight owned individually furnished
an ample supply of milk for those on
the farm They have added to the
number of their hogs and have improved
the strain They have several
hundred pecan trees budded with the
large paper shell variety and expected
them to bear in less than two
years They have reduced their cotton
acreage each year in conformity
to the A A A cotton program and are
pleased to do it as they wish to get
away from cotton as their only money
crop They are steadily increasing
their alfalfa acreage and raising a
variety of other feed crops They
have their own sawmill working up
their own timber as well as that of
neighbors and it has proved to be
next to cotton in gross and net income 
Early in February o f last year a
deal was closed for 2 882 acres of
land in Holmes county Mississippi 
about 100 miles from the first farm
by auto road It is called the Providence
Cooperative Farm Ten families
are now living there most of
them seasoned cooperators from the
Delta farm Their canner a Negro
woman who formerly was Negro
County Home Demonstration agent
in an adjoining county put up at
Providence about 6 000 quart cans
and jars of fruit berries and vegetables 
all grown on the farm The
cotton crop was only about one third
of what they expected due to the boll
weevils and not being able to work
flooded land in time but they hope
to correct those things A commercial
dairy was started last November
on the farm with 30 cows to
which 20 have since been added They
will add hogs and beef cattle as rapidly
as they can 
So much fo r the economic activities 
As to the religious educational 
social and health activities they have
been subsidized by gifts from outside
organizations and individuals who realize
it would be impossible for such
a small group to provide such services
for themselves from the outset 
There are now more than 30 familie
on the two farms and they hope
ultimately to have two farms support
100 families and that they will be
able to provide the above services for
themselves They will begin to assume
this burden at the earliest practicable
time 
And so the Delta Cooperative farm
experiment goes on In writing Mr 
Horswill A James McDonald office
secretary makes one request That
they are not represented to be on
the high road to success Adding that
they believe that they are but realize
that they have a long period of
hard work and good management
ahead of them before they can be
sure In the meantime the experiment
o f cooperation in the Delta Cooperative
farm at Rochdale Mississippi 
and its many phases are being
watched with keenest interest through
out the cooperative area This summary
has o f necessity been brief and
many interesting phases omitted but
at some future time we may have a
more detailed report

A ll 4-H club leaders who attended
the recent leaders meeting expressed
themselves as favoring more combined
leaders and project meetings to be
held in different parts o f the county 
and fewer county wide leaders meetings 
Project meetings held in different
parts o f the county will not only
make it more convenient for the leaders
to attend but will make it possible
fo r more club members to attend
and receive detailed instructions
on their projects More effective club
work should result from a better understanding
of the projects 
Clothing and foods project meetings
will be held at two centers in
the county on Saturday April 15th 
Club members will receive a notice
giving the time and place o f the
meetings Clothing and food specialists
from the College of Agriculture
will conduct the meetings Club members
are urged to attend one of these
meetings even though their clubs
have not held their first meeting The
demonstrations will be of interest to
all girl club members 
Beekeepers Meeting
The few beekeepers who found the
roads passable and were able to attend
on Wednesday March 15th decided
that the meeting should be postponed
until such time when road conditions
would permit all beekeepers to
attend A t that time James Gwin of
the Department of Agriculture and
Markets promised to come back whenever
a satisfactory date might be set
for a meeting This meeting will be
held at the court house on Monday 
April 10th at 1 :30 p m Since bee
inspection work cannot be carried out
in any county on a large scale without
a county organization it is necessary
that all beekeepers attend
this next meeting Those who attended
the first meeting were very
anxious to set up such a county organization 
Horse Sleeping Sickness
Last week answers were given to
a number of questions that are being
asked these days about horse sleeping
sickness 
Following are answers to the second
in this series of questions supplied
by Dr B A Beach head of the
department of veterinary science 
Wisconsin College of Agriculture 
Are fly nets and fly sprays of any
value Ans Yes decidediy so the
fewer insects that bite horses the better
is the chance of escape 
What should be done when an animal
comes down with the sleeping
sickness Ans Place horse in well
bedded stall Put cold packs on the
head and send for your veterinarians 
Where do the germs live over winter
Ans Evidence of their existence
in chickens turkeys pheasants 
gophers moles foxes dogs and
ground quirrels has been found It
seems likely that the sleeping sickness
germs may live over winter in a
lot o f different animals and fowl 
Horses may also be carriers; we are
not sure as to that 
Is chick vaccine of value in horse
sleeping sickness Ans Yes when
used as a preventive it has given excellent
results 
How long will horses be protected 
Ans Experiments show that
horses vaccinated with two injections
of a reliable chick vaccine were protected
at least six months 
How much horse sleeping sickness
will there be in Wisconsin next year
Ans No one knows Judging by
what has happened elsewhere however 
there will be considerable 
Is it advisable to vaccinate horses
against horse sleeping sickness Ans 
Yes we think it is The evidence in
favor of vaccination as a means of
protection is recidedly favorable 
When is the best time to vaccinate
Ans In April May and not
later than the middle o f June Horse
owners should beware o f misinformed
or unscrupulous individuals who
are injecting horses with products
other than the chick vaccine There
is no known product that will render
a horse resistant to horse sleeping
sickness except this specific vaccine 
Farmers planning to vaccinate their
horses should employ those who use
products manufactured by reliable
companies 
What is a good plan of procedure
Ans In some communities the interested"
horse owners interview their
neighbors I f 25 or more horses can
be lined up the veterinarians will perform
the work at a reduced price if
the horse owners will pay cash when
the work is completed The county
agricultural agents are in some instances
supplying cards properly in scribed
for the convenience of those
lining up the horses 
Do people contract horse sleeping
sickness Ans The germs of the
Eastern type have been isolated from
the brains of some children that died
of inflammation of the brain in Mass 
It has not been absolutely proven that
the Western type can produce human
disease although it may do so

The city o f Holland Michigan 
has announced its annual Tulip Festival
for the week o f May 13th to the
21st This festival marked by the
display of three million blooming tulips 
by pageantry and music will
bring to Holland thousands and thousands
o f visitors Holland Michigan 
has become famous for its myriads
o f blooming tulips and is known
as the  Tupil City of America 
 When its Tulip Time in Holland
flower lovers flock to Michigan 
W hy couldnt Black River Falls become
famous in the same way Why
couldnt we adopt a City flower to
be planted by all our citizens so that
in a few years time people might
come to this fair city to view our
Irises our Zinnias or whatever may
be the flower of our choice Why
not
The Social Problems class of the
local High school in connection with
its study o f Civic Beauty came to
the conclusion that such a project
would come to be of great value to
our city A fter consultation with the
city mayor the class adopted the plan
of submitting the question to the
citizens of Black River Falls which is
being done by means of the ballot to
be found in this issue o f the Banner-
Journal After due consideration the
class also  nominated flowers which
they considered desirable as a  city
flower though their nominations do
not preclude such from others as the
ballot provides a space for other
flowers than those listed 
In the choice of a flower adaptable
as a city flower a number of things
must be taken into consideration 
such as effectiveness and showiness
of bloom (would people be interested
in seeing them and would they
dominate the landscape) ease of cultivation 
(so all could easily raise it) 
low cost (so all could afford to plant
it) Should the flower be annual or
perennial depends upon whether we
want the flower to bloom over a long
period or concentration of bloom for
a brief period making an  Iris week
or some other week possible To aid
readers in making a good selection 
the class has prepared a chart showing
the relative merits of various
suitable flowers It is suggested that
people study it carefully before casting
their ballots for our city flower 
Please use the ballot to be found in
this issue or those which members of
the Social Problems class have for
ditribution and leave them at the
Banner-Journal office or with any
member o f the sponsoring class on
or before Friday April 14th Lets
adopt a flower and then concentrate
on its planting so that Black River
Falls may be known for the beauty
which systematic planting of flowers
and shrubs can bring to a community

Friends here will be very much interested
in the account of a trip containe
din a letter from Joe Antos a
former resident here and now o f Peoria 
Illinois 
602 Front Street Aurora 111 
January 30 1939
The Banner-Journal:
Black River Falls Wis 
Dead E ditor: We have recently
returned from a rather extensive trip
through eight southern state concentrating
most of our time on Florida
and the Islands otf its southern coast 
namely the Florida Keys Along the
way 1 gathered a considerable amount
of information such as historical data
along with several hundred natural
color photos It is my intention to
arrange this work into a book some
time in the very near future The fo llowing
is a brief and condensed version
of a somewhat more comprehensive
account of the tour 
I might say that the first point of
interest was the crossing of the gigantic
bridge over the Ohio river as
we entered the state of Kentucky at
Louisville Our route took us through
the rolling hills of old Kentucky 
through hills that grew in size until
soon tney assumed the proportions of
mountains 
There was something quaint and
appealing about Pineville Kentucky
as we found it nestled at the very
foot of the Cumberland mountains A
winding mountain highway soon took
us over the historical Cumberland
Gap Daniel Boone came through this
gap in 1769 and in 1775 he marked
a trail that led westward from Virginia
through the dense forests of the
wilderness towards the shores of the
Ohio river and became known as the
wilderness road A fte r gazing some
time from the top of the gap upon
the broad valleys of Virginia we proceed
southwestward for quite some
time along the very edge o f the Cumberland
mountains until at nightfall
we come upon that masterpiece of engineering
in the Tennessee valley the
Norris dam A fter going through the
power plant and inspecting the entire
dam we proceeded on to Knoxville 
where we stayed over night 
On the following day I had my
first glimpse of the great smoky
mountains While they do not in any
way assume those massive proportions
and that rugged splendor that
we saw in the Rockies of the west 
they do present an exalting charm in
their misty forms and their beauty
was far above my anticipation Distinctly
I remember how we approached
them how we entered a large gap
and those mountains just seemingly
closed in all around us while ahead
the higher peaks loomed into view in
all of their splendor as they stood gigantically
in the blue and purple
haze seemingly spanning the heaven
and earth their summits enfolded in
the white clouds of the still early
morn 
It was late in the afternoon when
we crossed the highest points and
started descending into North Carolina 
We stayed over night in North
Carolina in a cabin on the very edge
of the Tennessee river in the very
shadow of the Blue Ridge mountains 
How well I shall ever remember that
night the never ceasing rumble of
the river as it rushed madly on its
way from the higher mountain elevations 
the stars as they shone brighter
than I had ever seen them before 
casting their light over the ink black
outline of the mountains 
Next morning we drove through
the greater part o f the Nantahala
National Forest and the Skyland
country of Carolina Soon after entering
Georgia we left the mountains
behind and descended into flat level
country once again We first saw
Spanish moss and roses in bloom in
the central part of the state Upon
crossing St Marys river we entered
Florida We stayed a while in Jacksonville 
and sunset found us in St 
Augustine the oldest and most historic
city in the United States Gazing
into historical facts we learn that
it was here that Don Juan Ponce
De Leon landed in 1513 in his quest
for the fabulous fountain of youth
and claimed the land for Spain fifty
years later the galleon fleet of Don
Pedro Menendez De Avilles dropped
anchor in Matanza bay and the first
permanent settlement was established 
This settlement grew into a city
which was 210 years old at the outbreak
o f the Revolutionary war 
The four colorful centuries in the
history o f this place were revealed
before my eyes as I walked through
the old city gates down the ancient
St George street past the Spanish
treasury house and the palace of the
' Spanish Governors The short walk
on De Aville street was indeed pleasant 
The old Spanish houses with
their overhanging balconies the Don
Toledo house all stand there as they
did in the days o f Menendez i n the
northeast part of the city on the very
edge 01 Aiaiitanza bay and overlooking
the broad expanse 01 tne A tlantic
stands the Castillo De San Alarco 
tne massive fortress of Coquina liock
wmcn was begun by tne Spaniards in
i b 6o and required 9JL years lo r comceeded
southward along tne very edge
ol the Atlantic tnrougn large xorests
pietion t io in  t Augustine we proo
l palms and moss covered cypress
and scattered groves ox orange tnru
uaytona Jseacn r i l auueruam aiiu
iinaiiy imami wnere we saw tne ran-
Ainencan air base and seaplane terminal 
n e ie we saw several o i tne
giant Zb-ton liym g boats come in anu
again tae on tor distant ports in tne
Caribbean and tne J atni-American
countries 
anortiy a lte r leaving Miami we
passed tnrougn a great ueai o i Cariboean
pine and scattered neids ox tomatoes 
potatoes lettuce and caooage 
axter whicn we entered a ratner
dismal swamp anu soon tne o{fen
sea snowed up bexore us and we were
about to leave the mainland and  egin
tnat part ox our trip on tne roau
mat leaus 13o nines into the sea 
upon crossing tne iirst bridge we
found ourselves upon key Largo tne
largest ox tne Florida iveys We soon
crossed Tavernier creek entered the
Plantation i ey where schooners used
to take on loads of pineapples We
crossed several more bridges and
found ourselves upon upper Matecumbe 
Here stands the monument
dedicated to those who lost their lives
in the hurricane of 1935 I t was during
this storm that the railroad was
swept to sea and a motor highway
was built in its place Several more
islands and bridges were crossed and
we came to the Xamous 7-nuie bridge 
To the left of us was the Atlantic 
and to the right the G u lf of Mexico 
Farther and farther the bridge extended
ahead until it appeared to narrow
down to the size of a ribbon
and then seemingly disappear in the
horizon As we proceeded forward on
this bridge toward Bahia Honda Key
I observed the panorama of the bluegreen
waters surrounding us Here
and there in this broad expanse of
water the color would change from a
turquoise blue to azure blue and again
to a very light green This phenomena
I learned is largely due to underlying
coral reefs A fter several miles
of travel we crossed Bahia Honda 
then the Spanish channel and soon
found ourselves crossing the last of
the 35 bridges and entering the island
and city o f Key West We find Key
West to be a very hospitable city of
about 12 000 inhabitants upon seven
square miles of land located 170
miles south o f Miami only 90 miles
from Havana Cuba and 375 miles
farther south than Cairo Egypt It
is the most southern city in the U nited
States and a point where frost has
never been recorded We spent one
night here on this island in the tropical
atmosphere amid the waving 
swaying palms and southern breeze 
Next morning I saw the steamship
Cuba as she arrived and again took
off for the port of Havana 
That noon we started on our return 
back over those emerald isles
and expanses of turquoise sea thru
marvels of tropical loveliness fringes
of white coral sand and rainbow hued
breakers through isles that are decked
with swaying cocoanut palms bananas
and other fa r southern vegetation 
From Miami we proceeded westward
over the Tamiami Trail over
the vast lonely stretches of the Everglades 
5 000 square miles of mighty
saw-grassed morass fringed by cypress
swamps and broad savannas intermingled
with pine and palm hammocks 
known only to its inhabitants 
the Seminole Indians These remnants
of the Seminole nation did not always
live in this section but were driven
here from the northern part of the
state at the close of the long Seminole
Indian war Refusing to surrender
or to acknowledge the authority
of the United States they retreated
to these wilds where the soldiers
could not follow and today they live
at peace with the whites but under
their own tribal laws having never
submitted to the government and are
a nation by themselves 
Along the entire length o f the
route to Ft Meyers we found wild
life bountiful Water birds could be
seen most everywhere Once in a
while we would see a beautiful egret
or a flamingo 
At Ft Meyers rightly called the
city o f palms we visited the winter
residence of Henry Ford and also
the residence of the late Thomas
Edison West i f Arcadia we traveled
across tne entire lengtn ox n o r ma
s great prairie tne vast ievei
stretcn o i auout soUb square nines
covered only witn grass and uotteu
witn palmetto nere we xounu large
nerds ox cattle grazing and learned
mat this area is largely occupied uy
Wyoming rancners and rounu-upa
are conuucted nere tne same as tney
are in tne xar-on west 
(jpon reacnmg EaKe x'lacid we entered
tne citrus district anu on our
way nortn passed tnrougn couutitas
nmes of orcnards all heavny loadeu
with oranges lemons and grapexruit 
iom e orcnards actually extenueu several
miles in length 
A t Ocaia we stopped lo r a while
to see Silver bprings tne largest
spring in the woiid expelling auout
z'A million gallons ox water an nour 
A t the time ox my visit a short underwater
picture was being Xilmed by tlie
Fox-Movie-Tone company tne principal
actor being Ross Allen 
From Ocala to fallanassee we
drove through a vast unpopulated territory
covered mostly with pine timber 
Throughout most ox southern
Alabama we traveled across fla t level
wooded country dotted only here and
there with small fields through Montgomery 
once the cradle of the Confederacy 
through Birmingham into
Nashville Tennessee then crossing
once more the Ohio river at Evansville 
Indiana and finally concluding
the last lap of the trip toward home 
In its entirety the trip was most enjoyable
and covered slightly over
3600 miles and together with a previous
trip to the west I shall always
possess a very vivid picture as to the
vastness of our own United States

L ast Word in Convenience
The desire to make a car reflect its owners individuality is a potent factor
in the average motorists choice of accessory equipment And it would be
hard to find a more thoroughly "personalized car than this new Chevrolet
in which Mary Pickford is shown applying a touch of makeup As if the
handy illuminated vanity mirror wers not enough the car has a special kit of
Miss Pickford's own famous beauty aids now on the market under her name 
The container holding lipstick rouge powder and cream folds neatly up into

The caging Texacos who during
the past winter season have furnished
basketball fans hereabouts with lots
of basketball thrills in the process of
capturing seventeen triumphs in
twenty-two starts have relegated
their spangles to the moth balls until
once more the frost bitten ozone
shall be laden with alabaster flakes 
and the cage bug again shall tune his
vocals to hoarse cheers 
It was a great season for Merrillan 
and this year the boys had the
greatest ball club ever to bear the
local name Yes Warfield and Co o f
20 and 21 were good alright but
Warfield was  the works on that ball
club while the Texacos were so evenly
balanced that there was little to
choose between any two o f the entire
squad o f nine and then too in
 them days caging was quite a primitive
sport while at this moment it is
so finely developed that even small
school teams receive the benefit of
coaching that was unheard of except
in larger colleges in the caveman era
of bucketing art Some difference as
our old sport Model T and the present
stream lined chariots that zip
by our  Solome as she nobly chugs
and wheezes over the ribbons of grey 
Weve received quite a wallop out
of regaling the folks with the story of
deeds of Nichols Matalas Benson 
Christy Hayden Frost Kolbrak Barritt
and Porter and got endless thrills
out of watching the boys play Maybe
sometimes we ruffled a feeling or
two in an effort to stir up some  hot
rivalry but it was just for the- sake
o f rivalry Ever see a fight but what
a crowd gathered to see what was going
on think not This  grudge
business is great stuff So Coca Colas
i f youre referred to as a  bunch
o f bums think nothing of it we can
all have a lot of fun in basketball 
And now our job would be only
h alf done if we didit express our
appreciation to the Banner-Joumal
fo r the space they allowed us to clutter
up with our banter and box
scores 
It was really swell o f them and the
ball team as well as the  Bard say
 Thanks a million and if we turn in
more copy well try to make it in
keeping with the high quality and policy
that the B-J represents and we
want to say this where else in this
country could you find a paper with
features like the B-J Has Low Cloud 
Red Cloud Merlin H u lls editorials 
C aps comments Relyeas verse 
etc great s tuff and we really should
be glad to have the B-J to keep our

S p ring Fever
Ah-h-h! Spring is here at last 
even i f the weather is sometimes a
little deceiving Everything is seeming
to be springing up suddenly in
front o f my eyes Before everything
was covered with patches o f dirty
snow New scenery appears even if
it is only gobs o f mud and kids playing
marbles borrowed from the Chinese
checker boards probably 
W ith spring comes new ideas ( I
hope) skipping school girls grass 
and flowers Oh yes that reminds
me of Ferdinand the bull I wonder
what he does in winter when there
arent any flowers or bees 
Spring also makes that jolly old
sad sport o f housecleaning appear 
Taking out all o f my old clothes I m
so tired o f wearing and incidentally 
wearing them again 
 In the spring a young mans fa n cies
lightly turn to thoughts o f love 
Boy meets girl nature interferes and
a new romance hits the headlines 
That makes me think of a clever little
rhyme I heard on the subject by
some one who must have known his
springs:
 Love is a very peculiar thing;
I t s favorite season is guess who!
spring;
Though youve no im munity; a summer
or fall
There aint hardly no closed season at
a ll!
A n oyster may be crassed in love 
But most important o f all spring
brings that (ah sweet mystery of
life ) poetry Every one attempts it
and were lucky they realize the attempt
wasnt quite what it was rhymed
up to be Anyhow I ll sign off
with the feeling that spring also
brings with its other marvels a bad
case o f spring fever that prevents me
from working 
How fa ir the flowers 
How green the grass;
How gay the people
As they pass!
How free the birds;
How clear the sky;
How red the sun;
How blue am I !

Queer Queries
Have you seen a sheet for a river
bed
Or a single hair from a hammers
head
Has the foot o f a mountain any toes
And is there a pair o f garden hose
Does a needle ever wing its eye
Why doesnt the wing of an army fly
Can you tickle the ribs o f a parasol
Or open the trunk o f a tree at all
Are the teeth o f a rake inclined to
bite
Have the clock hands any left or
right
Is the garden plot quite deep and
dark
And what is the sound o f a birchs
bark
Nor you nor I nor any one
Can see a thing in this but f u n !

The House o f Representatives
made a huge plunge into  economy
when the Agricultural department appropriation
bill came up It was not
the first time there had been economy
talk in abundance There has been
much o f that the past seven or eight
years There was action this time 
Many o f the big city members whose
call for funds have been riotous at
times helped make it a field day for
a righteous attack on the deficit Administration
and opposition leaders
alike fairly made the welkin ring 
Economy has just got to start some
where somehow sometime and agri
culture was selected as the time the
place and the measure 
Thus far economy has had a hard
row with $750 000 000 for relief 
mainly to the large cities $355 000 -
000 for new war planes another
$200 000 000 additional for the Navy
and $530 000 000 more for the Army
not to mention a few hundred extra
millions for the merchant marine
naval bases on Pacific islands fo rtify
ing the Panama Canal hurricane losses
in New England and sizeable al
lowances for dams and irrigation projects 
and with a score more o f activities
of every kind the budget continued
to be warped twisted and
cracking in spots 
Along with numerous minor items 
the fight centered upon two principal
items that o f $250 000 000 for price
fixing parity payments to farmers who
produce cotton com wheat rice and
tobacco The southern and western
members went down the line fo r parity 
excepting some who felt that only
a small portion of all the farmers
would be benefitted by the plan The
administration budget makers had not
looked with favor upon this increase
and had not included it in their recommendation 
The amount asked for
was voted out instead of in and the
parity plan went glimmering at least
for tiie time being A t present government
loans for cotton amount to
$600 000 000 for com $70 000 000 
as much more in prospect the dairy
and for wheat $48 000 000 
The second big item was that for
extending the purchases by the Surplus
Commodity Corporation to relieve
the surpluses in the markets for
dairy products fruits vegetables 
canned goods etc The first attempt
to bolster dairy product prices was
made in an amendment offered to in crease
the percentage o f custom receipts
from ta r iff duties to take care
o f the situation In 1934 Congress
set aside 30 per cent o f such receipts
for purchases of such surplus products 
In 1937 the total customs receipts
were in excess of $500 000 000
and the 30 per cent for marketing
purposes was about $150 000 000 
Last year $42 000 000 of that amount
was set aside for the purchase of butter 
powdered milk etc Last year 
custom receipts were only about
$300 000 000 and that reduced the
fund for purchases of dairy products
to approximately $22 000 000 
In consequence of that reduction o f
funds the government stopped buying
dairy products for stabilization
and relief purposes on March 6th 
and dairy prices promptly fell to lower
levels with the decline continuing 
Predictions are that still lower
prices will prevail as the peak of production
approaches in the northwest
dairy states unless some plan is
adopted to take the surplus o f f the
markets The cost to the butter and
cheese producing states in lowered
prices will be many times the amount
required for government purchases 
The amendment designed to in crease
the percentage o f custom receipts
from 30 per cent to 60 per
cent in order to realize the needed
amount o f funds was promptly objected
to on the ground that it was
an attempt to obtain legislation in an
appropriation bill contrary to the
rules made and provided The point
o f order was made by the leader in
charge of the bill and the opposition
leader as well and it was blocked 
So urgent is the situation in the
dairy markets with a price decline of
20 per cent arnd a further decline of
farmers and associations got busy 
and in a couple o f days the leaders
realized that a mistake had been made
and sought a way out A n amendment
providing $60 000 000 for the purchase
of surplus commodities includin
g $35 000 000 fo r dairy products 
was rushed in apparently with an
understanding that a point o f order
would not be raised It came up immediately
after the parity amendment
while the House was still swinging
strong fo r economy and it was voted
down by a vote o f two-to-one So
what to do about butter and cheese
prices with a rapidly declining market
now looms as highly important 
Balancing the national budget at a
cost of millions to the dairy farmers
already suffering of ruinously low
prices will not be popular in dairy
sections 
As the economy fever was mounting
in the House the President was
planning an export program for cotton
which may not suit the Department
o f State with its reciprocal
trade plans a little bit The government
now holds 11 000 000 bales on
which it has loans at from $40 to
$60 per bale The president suggests
that the surplus be exported and sold
at any old price in the world markets 
I t would require a subsidy o f
from $75 000 000 to $90 000 000 in
order to dump the surplus on other
markets The Department o f State
heartily opposes any plan for dumping
surplus farm products abroad 
As the war situation eases down for
a time in Europe the president warns
that because o f Japan the construction
o f two super-battleships the
largest in the world will be authorized
at once They will be o f 45 000
tons mounting guns with a range o f
20 miles and have a speed faster than
any other battleships a flo a t Each will
cost from $80 000 000 to $90 000 -
000 The president does not intimate
that Japan may be immediately troublesome 
but that country is building
bigger and better battleships and
when they are finished the president
believes our navy should be well prepared
to meet them i f need be

State highway aid to towns cities
and villages has started pouring into
local treasuries the State Highway
commission announces Allotments
totalling $4 101 661 77 have been
certified this week by the highway
commission representing the states
annual contribution to localities for
the maintenance o f local roads and
streets 
Under state law these allotments
must be spent by the towns villages
and cities for the  improvement of
or removal of snow from public
roads and streets which are open and
used for travel and which are not
portions o f state or county trunk
highway systems and which do not
form direct connections between state
highways through cities 
This is only one of several shares
of the state highway dollar that go to
local communities The first share

A hobby has seven distinguishing
characteristics:
1 It is persistently pleasureable 
It is a joy of existence it is the
source of living 
2 It is zealously pursued it coaxes
tireless indulgence it is a quest never
ended 
3 I t is optimistically planned it is
a will-o-the-wisp with a bright fu ture 
it knows no discouragement 
4 It is the subject of enthusiastic
conversation; one must pay most
men to talk about their work but it
is difficult to prevent their talking
about their hobbies 
5 It is begun without thought of
rofit and may even be expensive 
ence it is an avocation it demands
an amateur; but the success may become
so great as finally to lead the
hobbv rider into the professional
field '
6 I t is individually possessed The
mob may indulge in fads or fashions
or crazes but my hobby is my very
own; the hobby rider rides alone the
faddists in groups 
7 It makes its possessor free;
when working at his vocation he is
doing what he has to do but his hobby
frees him from restraint and permits
him to do what he wishes

to dream about next summers flower

man showers us with gaily colored i lons

in has pages o f attractive ads Even
the radio does its bit toward making
us spring-minded We look out the
kitchen window at a brown streaked
snowbank and presto! we see instead
rhubarb and radishes fresh green onlilacs

supervision
The great strides that have been
made during the past few years toward
proper treatment of municipal
sewage have been a boon to aquatic
sport and the states reputation as a
summer playground is going to profit
directly from these sanitary projects 
A recent survey made by the state
board of health listed 51 municipally
operated artificial swimming pools
open to the general public 40 indoor
pools operated by colleges and
schools 14 operated by the Y M 
C A and the Y W C A 12 operated
by other institutions and three
by industries in Wisconsin 
These artificial pools are great
things Every year they turn out
thousands of new swimmers and to
know how to swim proves vitally im portant
once or twice in a lifetime 
The state offers advisory service to
operators o f pools and beaches thru
the board o f health which administers
a sanitation code on the subject 
One of the five typhoid fever
! deaths that occurred in Wisconsin
1 last year was the result of swimming
:in grossly polluted water which naturally
was not a designated bathing
place When the water in or near a
supervised bathing place shows dangerous
pollution health officials have
the power to close the beach until the
pollution is abated 
COMMON SENSE CON SE RV A T ION
(B y L H Kingston)
This is no secret but do you know
that the trout season has already
opened for a certain privileged class
o f anglers in this state  Fact is they
have been going strong in their poscatorial
activities several weeks now for
wren the ground hog came out looking
for his shadow this ilk o f the
angling tribe swung rapidly into action
and when March came in neither
lamb nor lion caused any perceptible
hesitation in what was going on 
Today come darkness or storm the
run continues regardlessly for this
brand o f fishing is all done under
glowing mazdas where the winds
dont blow There are old flies to
rejuvenate rods to varnish tapered
lines to clean and refinish There are
tackle catalogs to study and fishing
supplies to order Every outing magazine
brings in a batch o f new wrinkles
in the fishing game which must
be carefully analyzed Busiest of all
are the boys who are tying their own
bugs and undoubtedly it is they who
reach the ultimate in the enjoyment
o f fishing 
This angling in the abstract is the
happiest phase of the sport We
spend days in anticipation o f a few
hours of participation The streams
in our dreams are crystal clear they
eddy in pools paved with coral and
pearl or slip quietly over bars of
golden sand Lazily drifting clouds
are white against the blue of infinity
and the sun of the long afternoon
makes shadows under the trees But
best of all we dont have to remember
to bring along our mosquito dope
