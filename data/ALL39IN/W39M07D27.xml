Sportsmen Jamboree July 29-30
CODES \ P O S S IB IL IT Y
Codes of fair competition for four
industries — barbers, cosmeticians,
cleaners and dyers, and shoe repairers
appeared a possibility for urban
Wisconsin again as the senate by a
22-8 vote sent over to the assembly
a bill reenacting codes under a fair
trades practice act. Codes under the
law set up by the 1937 legislature expired
on April 1.
A previous attempt to reenact code
legislation in the form of a bill in tho
assembly failed when the lower house
by amendments took out the price
fixing and wages and hours provisions
and left the bill useless as far 'is regulation
was concerned. Because of
the assembly's previous action it is
expected that the code bill wlil meet
stiff opposition.
The measure as passed by th ? senate
will not apply to counties having
less than 30,000 population nor tu
cities, towns and villages with less
than 5,200 population. The codes, if
the measure is finally enacted int.*
law, will be administered by tho department
of agriculture and markets
An amendment introduced by Senators
Brown and Connors which provides
that should farmers band together
they would be guaranteed cost
of production plus a fair rate of return,
was adopted. Authors of the
bill pleaded that the amendment b?
rejected because there was no provision
in the bill to allow it to work.

HALKM T AX T ALK
Delayed action on the administration
tax bill scheduled for the senate
last week, ao that amendments embodying
Governor Heil’s message suggestions
could be drawn up, once
more brings about rumors of a sales
tax.
The tax measure as adopted by the
assembly still leaves an eight and onehalf
million dollar shortage. The governor
has suggested reenacting the
telephone surtax, a new’ 4-cent tax on
lubricating oils, a privilege truck license
feo, a 10 per cent reduction of
state government personnel, and i decrease
from three to two weeks of
state employee vacations to meet the
shortage.
Many Republicans would rather in voke
a generals sales tax of three
cents and pay ba» k generous am ount'
to local unit* fo r property tax relief
than to euaet numerous lesser taxes
and incur the wrath of special groups
such all those representing tobacco. |

T A V E R N LIM IT A T IO N
Nearing enactment into law is the
Siebert tavern limitation bill, fixing
the number of taverns in ill communities
at one per each 500 population
The bill originated in anil pas rd by
the assembly has been concurred in
by the senate.
However, before agreeing with the
lower house, the senate attached an
amendment which deprives the bill of
tho necessary machinery for reducing
the number of taverns to the 1-500
quota, and will perhaps have the effect
of keeping taverns at the present j
number. Before going to the gover-!
nor the bill now must go back to the
assembly for action on the senate :
adopted amendment.
* * * *
P E N S IO N COMMITTEE
The assembly and senate have
agreed that it is time definite action
Is taken on old age pension problems, i
and have adopted a resolution calling
for a joint house committee repre-;
senting all parties, to study pension |
bills. I t is expected that the commit |
tee will recommend a pension bill for j
passage.
Pensions have been a most irritat- j
ing problem for the Republican ad- .
ministration. Although the budget,
adopted makes a larger appropriation
for old age assistance than any previous
state legislature has ever offered,
the increasing number of eligible
old age recipients makes it doubtful
if the present allotment would a llow
a payment equal to that paid out
during the past biennium.
There is a possibility that maximum
benefits may be increased this year
* because of a proposed change in the
federal pension policy. An amendment
adopted by the U. S. senate to
the pension bill provides for federal
matching of state appropriations 2 to
1 up to $15 and for an equal amount
with the state's appropriation beyond
mission, has been passed by the sen
ate, 20-12, and now goes to the assembly,
where it also is expected to pass.
The tax commission and public welfare
department bills have been passed
by the assembly and now need sen-

on Consistency:
“Consistency,” so says Emerson, “ is
the hobgoblin of little minds.” Perhaps
he is right. Certainly then our
language was constructed by the great
minds of the ages for there is little
that is consistent in its construction.
In a recent issue of the Reader’s
Digest, Alexander Woolleott pans a
Los Angeles physician and his “scantily-
equipped school marm" because this
M. D. was under the deluson that all
descriptive adverbs end with ly and
his pet peeve was the sign “Drive
Slow.” A western legislature has
ordered 10,000 roadside signs bearing
this legend, “ Drive Slow.” Dr. Woollcott’s
only comment on the wording is
that it is redundant. “ Slow” would be
enough. He expatiates on the descriptive
adverb further:
“ One would hardly advise a motorist
to “drive straight-ly ahead.” One
would not take these words of our
great Theodore Roosevelt “ Don’t
flinch, don’t foul; hit the line hard”
and say “ hit the line hard ly.”
There are many inconsistencies if
we look for them. For instance, in
an apple we find seeds; in a cherry we
find pits; and in a peach, a stone. If
we plant an apple seed, a cherry pit,
and a peach stone do a seedling, a pit -
ling and a stone-ling come up?
Take these three words with almost
identical spelling: cough — dough —
bough. Why such inconsistency in
pronunciation ?
Consistency is perhaps unimportant
in our grammatical forms but it is
very important on the road. How
often do we not drive along and all
but smash into the rear of the car
ahead as it makes a sudden turn right
or left with an almost imperceptible
decrease in speed. A consistent set of
signals consistently enforced is highly
desirable and would be a great safety
measure.
Consistency may be the hobgoblin of
small minds but we would yearn for
more small minds on our highways
and byways and fewer great minds behind
the wheels of cars in respect to
driving, at least.

29. He was about 55 years old and
a widower, his wife having died about
a year ago. His home was in Helper,
Utah.
The decedent came to this country

from an enjoyable trip to the East,!
which included New York City an d ’

places in Canada. They were gon
several weeks and traveled about j

' " p IM E is so short, so swift in pass-
* ing, we should never be at loss

to take this valuable time for fun,
or is there something important I
can do with it? ”
Consider the life of Henry Ford
He was born on a farm near Dearborn,
Mich., in 1863. The oldest of
five children, Henry helped his fa- j
ther with the plowing, shucked corn, ,
mow’ed hay, cut grain, dug potatoes,
and milked cows. Time nev- 1
er hung heavily on his hands. Mechanically
inclined, he rigged up a
small machine shop on the farm
and repaired watches at night for
the village jeweler. After finishing
the local public schools, the farmer
boy left for the city to seek his fortune
In Detroit, he obtained a job
as a mechanic’s apprentice and the
fortune he received was $2.50 per
week. When he was twenty-four
he returned to the farm and ran a
sawmill, experimenting in his spare
time with a steam car. There was
never a question in his mind about
what to do with time.
His father was not in sympathy
with Henry F ord’s experiments, so
he again went to Detroit, and
worked for a power and light company
at. an engineer on the night
shift. During the seven years that
he was there he became general
m anager; and night after night, at
home, he worked far into the morning
hours in developing a gasoline
motor car. Success came from his
experiments at last, and in order
to popularize the new vehicle, Henry
Ford built racing cars and drove
them himself in race after race.
You know where Henry Ford stands
today, one of the richest men in the
world, employing hundreds of thousands
of m tn .
H « life is the story of time well
used. It is an example worth remembering
the next time you are
wondering “ how to kill time.'*

Touring Girls Take Part in
Kentucky Hill-Hilly Wedding
The Misses Maxine Buss, Ora Ranke,
Irma Schwartzkopf. Mildred Peterson
and Dorothy Konkol, of Norrie, and
Miss Cornelia Nowinski, of Hatley, returned
on Wednesday from a tour that
took them into Kentucky. While in
that state, they had the unexpected
experience of suddenly being called
upon to act as attendants at a hillbilly
wedding. The girls had stopped
to take pictures of a place called
“marriage parlor” by the natives just
as a young couple were arriving to be
joined in wedlock. The magistrate,
Alonzo Paddocks, asked the couple

CONGRESS:
Pensions
Many a Republican, and a few
Democratic legislators were elected
last November on the promise that
Dr. Francis E. Townsend's $200-amonth
pension plan—to be financed
by a 2 per cent transaction tax—
would get a hearing. Hearing it
got, but little else. Yet Townsendites
are potent enough to cause plenty
of trouble in next year's election.
D R . TOWNSEND
Beaten, but tbe ghost still haunts.
To satisfy the pension vote, to provide
weapons for next year's Democratic
campaign based on "humanitarianism
” and to soothe tax-eaten
businessmen, the senate passed
amendments to the social security
act which, if approved by the house,
would:
1) Broaden old age insurance to
include 1,100.000 persons like seamen
and bank employees, and step up
the starting date from 1942 to 1940
(2) Require states to supply $10
per month for each pension beneficiary,
the U. S. to match state
funds 2 to 1 up to a total pension of
$15 per m onth; i.e.. a total monthly
m in im um of $23 for each beneficiary.
(3) Freeze the present 1 per cent
payroll tax against both employees
and employers until 1943, instead of |
jum ping to 1 4 per cent next year.
Estimated saving to employers and
employees: $275,000,000 annually.
(4) P e rm it downward revision in
payroll taxes to finance state unemployment
insurance. Estimated annual
saving to employers: $80,000,-
000.
Fly in the ointment was that the |
plan actually boosted federal-state I
cost while lowering taxes, a situa- !
tion which on its face fails to add up.
Though a new "contingency" social
security reserve of $8,000,000,000 will
replace the old plan for an eventual
reserve of $47,000,000,000, Michigan’s
Sen. Arthur Vandenberg figured the
senate had added $750,000,000 to the
cost (spread over 15 years) without
providing any method of paying.
RELIEF:
*1/ n grateful'
Old WPA regulations provided union
wages for skilled workmen, who
thus labored fewer hours for their
monthly pay than did unskilled reliefers.
E xample: Union carpenters
m ight work 53 hours a month and
pick up odd jobs on the side; common
ditch-diggers might work 121
hours for the same money.
Said WPA A dministrator F. C.
Harrington to congress: " I t is my
recommendation that persons em ployed
on . . . WPA be required to
work 130 hours a month and that
earnings of such persons be on a
monthly basis . . . ”
Said congress: O. R.
Said more than 100,000 reliefers,
going on strike: Congress must restore
union wages.
Said President Roosevelt: "Y o u
cannot strike against the governm
ent.”
But strike they did. In Minneapolis
two lay dead after riots. Mayor
George E. Loach asked Washington
to “ clean up the mess" and State
WPA Administrator Linus Glotzbach
shut down all Minneapolis projects
President Roosevelt found himself
on a spot with both A. F. of L. and
C. I. O . who have helped elect both
him and his friends. But both congress
and the White House apparently
stuck to their guns despite
bellowing by John Lewis and William
Green. Commented the Cincinnati
Enquirer: "The American people
have a great deal of patience
with the unfortunate and needy. But
they have little patience with the
ungrateful . . . ”
ASIA:
Exit Britain?
One hot day in Tokyo workers at
the British embassy heard a storm
brewing outside. Soon • mob that
numbered 15,000 began throwing
stones and denouncing "B ritish intervention
in C h in a ." “ British im perialism
in A sia" and "B ritish support
of the murderer, Chiang Kaishe
k," who is Chinese generalissim
o . The day before two hand grenades
had been thrown into the British
consulate at Tsingtao. Spreading
down the coast, Ja p a n ’s blockade
of British concessions struck
awfully close to home when the
crown colony of Hongkong found itself
threatened by food shortages as
Nipponese vessels blocked ports at
Changchow, Tungshan and Chaoan.
All able-bodied Britons in Hongkong
were subsequently conscripted.
In such a tense atmosphere British
Ambassador Sir Robert Leslie
Craigie opened his long-touted conversations
with Foreign Minister
Hachiro Arita, knowing full well no
settlement would be reached. Japs
demand that Britain cease supporting
General Chiang and abandon her
“ anti-Japanese policy in China,”
which would constitute complete
surrender of all her Asiatic interests.
Britain, on the other hand, insists
that discussions shall deal only
with the original conflict over Ja p
blockade of the British concessions
at Tientsin.
When the first day's preliminary
confab ended in hopeless deadlock,
key Ja p officials on the Chinese front
issued more threatening statements
and precipitated a few more incidents
to help make up the harried
British mind. First sign of what
may become wholesale British withdrawal
from China came when missionaries
were shipped from Kaifeng,
important Honan province railroad
city, sharp on the heels ot a
Jap-inspired ultimatum.
EUROPE:

LOUISIANA:
Indictments
Out of its celi at Baton Rouge
walked a parish grand jury to plump
down the makings of a scandal that
started with Louisiana State university's
President Jam es Monroe
Smith, spread to include two of his
aides and finally caught in its net
Dr. Clarence A. Lorio who is presi- I
dent of the Louisiana Medical so- j
ciety, state senator, member of
LSU's supervisory board and its
medical director, physician and surgeon
for the state penitentiary and
visiting physician for the tubercular
hospital. The 29 indictments hit:
Dr. Lorio, for allegedly receiving
stolen property and conspiring with
300*pound George Caldwell (ousted
LSU construction superintendent) in
embezzling $249 in school building
materials.
Caldwell, «on two counts alleging
embezzlement of LSU building m a terials
worth $2,097. He is already
under federal charges of diverting
WPA materials for private use.
E . N. Jackson, LSU business m anager,
charged (with Caldwell) with
embezzling $480 in school materials,
and separately with receiving stolen
property.
Dr. Smith, charged on 23 counts,
12 of them with forgery, 11 with
altering minutes of the board of supervisors
so he could (1) borrow
$500,000 from three banks: (2) add
$3,600 ,%bonus" to his yearly $15,000
salary; (3) allow Caldwell 2 per
cent commission on all WPA construction
at LSU.
INTERNATIONAL:
Neutrality
Every congressman and senator
wants to keep the U. S. out of war.
But of ideas on how this shall be
done, there are almost as many as
there are lawmakers. Late in 1935
congress banned shipment of arm a ments
to warring countries in the
first neutrality act. E arly the next
year it added a provision banning
loans to belligerents. In 1937 came
a third provision, banning export of
goods to embattled nations except on
a cash-and-carry basis. The latter
provision expired two months ago.
This year, with war hovering over
Europe and Asia at the probable
expense of Friends Great Britain
and France, President Roosevelt
wanted new neutrality legislation.
His chief aim : Repeal of the arms
embargo because it encourages selfsufficing
aggressor nations like Germany,
Italy and Ja pa n. To replace it
he wanted the cash-and-carry provision
restored, since Britain and
France would nominally control the
sea during wartime and could pay
for their purchases. Isolationists
meanwhile called his attention to
the fact that Ja p a n is also a big
m aritim e power.
Upshot was a senate foreign relations
committee decision to table
neutrality for this session.
While British economists were privately
calling wary U. S. isolationists
“ cowardly,’' there was good
reason to think all neutrality legislation
may be wiped from the books
and a return made to old international
law. Thus the President would
be better off, isolationists would be
partly satisfied and—politically im portant—
the intra-party Democratic
squabble would cease.

Squalus carried 26 men to their

CARTER FIELD
Anuuing angles turn up in
battle Roosevelt is waging
over amendment to the neutrality
law . . . Sentiment
seems to be that Senator Norris
of Nebraska is due for a
deflating . . . Monetary bill
not likely to become an issue
in the coming presidential
campaign.
WASHINGTON.—The battle President
Roosevelt is waging over the
amendment of the neutrality law has
some am azing angles. To begin
with, scarcely any intelligent observer,
unswayed by politics, really
believes that any law that congress
could possibly pass will insure keeping
the United States out of war.
And as to neutrality, as Bernard
M. Baruch told the senate foreign
relations committee, "There ain ’t no
such a n im a l.”
Any possible law will hurt one side
or the other in any m ajor conflict.
It is openly admitted that the sort
of law the President wants would
probably favor France and Britain
as against Germany and Italy in
the war everybody is afraid of right
now. And curiously enough everyone
admits that the continuance of
the present law favors China in the
struggle against Ja p a n , as long as
it continues to be an undeclared
war, but would favor Ja p a n the mom
ent two-year conflict became a declared
war.
But the present law, for the preservation
of which a new battalion
of death has been organized in the
senate, bans shipments to belligerents
(in a declared war, of course)
of “ arms, am m unition and implements
of w a r.” There is no mention
of food, or of steel or cotton which
can be made into explosives. And
there is very little prospect that
any determined fight will be made
to include those. Yet actually they
are of the essence.
Food Most Important of
Articles We Might Export
Looking at the situation practically,
of all the articles that this country
m ight export to the nations mentioned
as being favored by the President's
plan, food is the most important.
The rest of the things follow
so fa r behind as to be relatively
unimportant. In a big long drawn
out war it is starvation, both of her
arm y and navy and of her civilian
population, that Britain fears most.
France is pretty nearly self-supporting,
leaving out the possibility of
extended occupation of her territory
such as occurred in the World war.
Everyone knows also that lack of
foodstuffs was one of the elements
which operated potently to bring
Germ any to her knees in the World
war. The darkest days of that war,
from the standpoint of the allies,
were those when there was terror
that the Germ an submarine blockade
m igh t starve out England.
It is common knowledge that E n g land
has been stepping up her arms
and munitions and airplane production
to the point where supplies of
these war materials m ay not be of
pressing importance. The longer
the outbreak of war is delayed, the
less im portant these particular im ports
will be. The rush buying of
planes and munitions by B ritain and
France in the last year from this
country was against the possibility
that war m ight break out before
their own productive capacity was
adequate.
Of course they will continue to
need the raw materials. But none
of these is barred in the present neut
r a l i t y law. So that the situation is
presented that the neutrality bloc in
the senate is staging a heroic battle
to prevent shipment to France and
Britain of things that they probably
will not need when war comes, and
is doing nothing to prevent shipments,
at that time, of things that
Germany will probably be doing her
utmost to prevent Britain and
France from getting.
Monetary B ill Not Likely to
Be an Issue in Campaign
There is much talk about the monetary
bill being an issue in the
cam paign but, while it is of course
impossible to say that it will not be,
it would seem that the probabilities
are against it. It is far more likely
that, as far as the voters are concerned,
it will be forgotten.
Had the revolt against President
Roosevelt succeeded, that would
have been something else again.
Had the net result been that the government
ceased its subsidizing of domestically
mined silver, that would
hav* been decidedly a couple of other
horses. It might easily have been
ths decisive element in determining
who is to be the next President of
the United States.
Then, the silver mine owners and
the silver mine employees would
have had reason to remember, with
resentment, the whole affair. It may
be that the President's remarks at
Hyde P ark, attacking the Republi-
| cans for supporting higher silver
prices, would have redounded to the
benefit of the Republicans.
As it is, the silver mine owners
i will get just six cents an ounce,
roughly, more than they were getting
before. ! t is not important politically.
Even if it were terribly
important economically, which it is
not, it would have been a settled
fact so long before the heat of the
campaign develops that only a few
persons would have been interested.
It may be that the Republicans
will be able to make some use of
the continued subsidizing of foreign
silver. Few persons inside the United
States are in favor of that, and
these few only exporters to silver
producing countries, of which, after
Mexico is named, there a r t few.
Important Factor I t if
Something Else Pops Up
But that issue also m ay result in
indifference on the part of the voters.
T h j important factor there is
whether anything else happens to
keep public interest in it alive. For
example if, during the presidential
campaign, Mexico is still being held
up to the public, because of news
events then, as treating American
capital badly—if she happens to be
selling the oil from the wells she
confiscated from Americans, for example,
to Germ any—this particular
subsidy will hurt the Democrats considerably.
This subsidizing of foreign mined
silver is a very difficult thing to defend,
on the stump. There are business
men who favor it, business men
with things to sell to Mexico and
other silver producing countries, but
naturally such individuals are the
rare exception when it comes to calculating
voting strength. They sim ply
do not count.
So, if it happens to be a dull
campaign, with very little to interest
the voters, this foreign silver
situation just might happen to be
important, especially as none of the
rank and file of the Democrats
would be interested in defending it.
Or, if Hitler should be raising cain
at the time, with Mexico apparently
on the side of the dictatorships, it
m ight easily become a tremendously
important issue.
Senator .Xorrit of Nebraska
Seems Due for Deflating
If one m ay predict the toppling
off their pedestals of present idols
by the same rules which have generally
worked in the past, Sen.
George W. Norris of Nebraska is due
for a deflating. He has run up
against that curious and hard to
understand intangible—pride in itself
of the house of representatives.
He may or m ay not win this time—
in the conference row over that TVA
hundred-million-dollar bond authorization.
But he has hurt the pride
of the house, and the wound will not
heal. Nothing lasts forever, and the
members of the house as well as
the senate were getting a little tired
of the Norris dictatorship anyhow.
So when Norris appeared as the
only senator to represent the upper
house in the conference
on the TVA
bill, he was taking a
chance. He ought to
have realized it, but
dictators gradually
grow callous to pride
in other people.
Members of the
h o u s e generally
m ight not ever have
known about it, but
Andrew J . May of 8rnmtor N(>rrta
Kentucky, chairman
of the house m ilitary affairs committee,
was enraged at Norris’ unyielding
attitude. So he issued a
statement which began:
“ Responsibility for the present
stalemate of the house and senate
conferees . . . is squarely on the
shoulders of Sen. George W. Norris.
It is a sad commentary on our democratic

one member of ‘the most deliberative
body in the world’ does not
know the meaning of the word compromise
and presumes to impose his
will, arbitrarily and arrogantly,
upon the house of representatives.”
/Vo One IT’ants to Get Into
Controversy W ith Norris
Those are pretty nearly fighting
words to the house! O r at the very
least, they are calculated to bring
about a declaration of independence.
One m ay wonder why Uncle George
laid himself open to the attack. Not
by his stubbornness. No one who
knows Norris would expect anything
else. But by his very delight in the
fact that the other senate conferees
were entirely willing to leave everything
to h im—thus putting him in the
position of one m an telling the house
what it could and could not do!
It is not at all surprising that the
other senate conferees did not attend
the meetings. They did not
want to get involved in a controversy
with Norris. Nobody does. It
is not very healthy politically. When
everybody assumes that one’s antagonist
is absolutely honest and sincere
one starts out with two strikes
and an unfavorable umpire. And it
was so easy to say to Norris, “ You
just go ahead and chew those house
fellows up. We are behind you 100
per cent.’’ Especially as his fellow
senators had such marvelous excuses
for looking out for the interests
of their farmer constituents in
the agricultural bill.
But the house members didn’t like
it at all. They are very jealous
of the senate anyhow, though individually
most of them aspire to togas.
There is no more sure-fire appeal
than an appeal to the pride of
the house as against the senate.
Moreover, there is a new generation
in the house that knows not
Joseph. Almost nobody is left who
served with Norris when he was
battling against Uncle Joe Cannon.
To m any of the newcomers he is
just a tiresome tradition.

Miss Moss asked: "W h y didn't
Mr. and Mrs. Hurder wake up, I
wonder?”
CUnt suggested: “ Smoke got
them, m aybe.”
But June said: “ They slept pretty
soundly, usually. And Aunt Evie
gave them some warm m ilk when
she put them to bed.” Her voice for
a moment was dry, as though it
m ight crack. She repeated: "They
slept soundly."
Tope looked at Miss Moss; and
then he asked awkwardly: "About
Mr. and Mrs. Hurder. How—what
do you think?”
“ They were unconscious,” Clint
explained. “ The firemen got a pulmotor.
Doctor Cabler was there. I
d id n ’t wait to hear. I brought June
aw ay.”
Miss Moss said: “ I ’m glad you
did, CUnt. Miss Leaford, I ’m going
to put you to bed in our spare
room. Clint, you will stay here ton
ig ht?”
lu n e protested: "O h , I don’t want
to go to bed.”
And Tope reflected: "F u n n y that
the Arc department took so long to
a nsw er." He asked C lint: "M rs
Taine or any of them surprised to
see you there? Surprised to see June
up and dressed?”
CUnt nodded, with a smile at June.
"M a tte r of fact, we had quite a
row ,” he admitted. “ June and I
had Mr. and Mrs. Hurder out of the
house when Mrs. Taine got there.
She asked if they were dead, and I
d id n 't know. So she knelt down to
feel them, and then Asa came
along, and she told us to carry
them into the Bowdon house. We
did, and about that time the firemen
got there, and I went outside again
and took June with m e .”
The others were listening intently,
and Miss Moss watched the girl
and liked her. “ But Mrs. Taine
cam e out after us,” he explained.
“ June had on a new dress that Asa
had given her, and Mrs. Taine didn’t
approve of that. She wanted to know
why June wasn’t in bed and asleep,
and who I was, and about this dress
. . . She had burned her hand, and
m aybe that upset her, but she was
pretty unpleasant, and I got good
and mad.
"F in a lly she told June to go into
the Bowdon house and take off that
dress and go to bed, and I got up
on m y ear. I told her June was
coming home with m e .”
June lifted her head; and Clint
held her close. "M rs. Taine thought
I was crazy,” he said. "B u t June
stood up for herself.”
"1 told her I never would live
there ag ain,” the girl cried, in a
sudden passion of grief and woe.
“ Oh, I can’t go back. Ever! I t was
terrible, always, there.”
Miss Moss came quickly to her
aide. "Now that’s enough for ton
ig h t," she decided. " I ’m going to
put you to bed, child. Come.”
“ No, no,” June protested. “ I
can't. I don’t want to be alone.”
The Inspector said soberly: “ The
fire chief figures the fire was set.
Gas exploded in the cellar.” Miss
Moss nodded; and Tope exploded iiv
a ( r im w rath: “ I told Heale, daj i
ago, that when a m an starts kifflng,
he m ay go on.”
She touched his hand, comSTrting
h im ; and he asked: "W h a b ft> you
th in k ? "
She hesitated. " I f R ab T f l p was
tn Providence, and Asa Mrs.
Taine and Mrs. Bowdon^Bere together,
then only Mr. j p i n e was
•lo n e .” 
"They found Taine •‘ leep in a
C ia ir in the kitchen a j h i s house,”
he (aid. " I asked H a i c . But Glovere's
still missing.” ^ '
She looked a tJ rh im curiously.
“ Asleep?” she repeated. "B u t Miss
Lraford said ttx y saw Mr. Taine
turn out the Uglit!”
"S h e said tfc y saw the light go
out,” Tope corrected. “ Mrs. Taine
said the lifFits went out in the Bowden
houaar, too. But anyway, Taine
was asleep in the chair when they
fo tm i' him. Or pretended to be.”
Miss Moss considered. “ I should
like to know,” she reflected, "why
his light went o ut?”
“ Heale told me once that the three
houses were all on one meter,” Tope
recalled. "W ired from the Hurder
cellar. The flre might have shorted
the wires, or melted them.”
“ Then why did the current go
off in the Tame house before the
fire started?” she insisted. “ And
what started the fire? And why did
it spread so fast? And why was the
department so slow in answering
the alarm ? And how did Mrs. Taine
burn her hand?”
Inspector Tope made a gesture
of amused surrender. " I don't know
Mrs. Tope,” he protested. "Wish 1
did.”
She nodded, smiling faintly. " I ’ll
lake care of Miss Leaford,” she
promised. "W h ile you find out the
anawersl”
which like rats the Uttle flames still
played. And all about, in a thin circle,
curious folk were standing by.
CUnt puUed up beside the road, and
Inspector Heale saw their arrival
and came across to meet them.
“ That you, Tope?” he asked
“ Young Jervies with you? Where’s
the g irl?” He was peering into the
car.
Inspector Tope said: “ Mrs. Tope
put her to bed. She was tired out.
CUnt here can teU you all there is
to tell.”
Heale nodded. “ You spotted the
flre, didn’t you, Jervies?” he asked.
So CUnt told his story, briefly,
the Inspector listening without interruption
till the young man was
done. Then Inspector Heale began
to question h im ; and Tope left them
together and walked over toward
the fire. There were two or three
scores of people here, roused by
the ala rm or wakened by the glare
of the flames against the rainy sky,
and come to watch the conflagration
to its end. Tope moved among
them quietly, listening to the fragmentary
conversations here and
there.
Then he saw Asa Taine, in the
shadows by the old barn, talking to
someone—Lissa Thayer.
Her countenance was in darkness,
since Asa stood between her and the
CH APT ER X I
Tope and CUnt arrived at Keneaaw
Hill toward four in the mornto
find the house all collapsed
fcrto a mass of timbers through
“ This was a spare thin woman/*
fire, so Tope could not see her expression;
but he saw Asa bend nearer
her, his arms encircling her in a
swift embrace, his face close to hers.
Then someone called Topes
nam e, and the old m an saw Lissa
slip away into the darkness as Heale
and Clint came to his side. At the
same tirra Asa recognized Clint, and
he approached them.
“ HuMo, Jervies,” he said, in a
friendly tone. “ What have you done
wiUI Ju n e ? ” Heale and Tope were a
little to one side.
/ * * ! took her home,” C lint explained.
“ I thought she ought to get
away from here.’*
Asa nodded approvingly. “ I t ’s
been hard on her here, even before
tonight,” he assented. “ But if you
don’t bring her back, you’ll have a
hornets’ nest around your head.
They won’t let her get aw ay.” He
grinned encouragingly. “ Stick to
her, Jervies. Hang on to her. Don’t
let them scare you.”
“ I ’m keeping Ju ne ,” C lint told
h im stoutly. He spoke to Tope, uneasily.
“ I ’m pretty tired,” he said.
“ I ’ll go home, if you don’t mind.
Be with them there.”
Tope nodded; and Asa turned and
saw the Inspector. “ H u llo !” he exclaimed
in surprise. “ Inspector
Tope, eh?” He looked past Tope at
Heale, a swift conjecture in his
eyes.
C lint departed, and a fireman
joined them. Water dripped from
the rim of his white helmet, and his
rubber coat was glistening. He said
to Inspector Heale: “ We can’t do a
thing for hours yet. Too hot.”
Asa demanded: “ Do what? What
do you m e an?”
Inspector Heale hesitated. “ This
is Chief Mason, Tope,” he explained;
and then to Asa: “ Why,
Mr. Taine, we think this flre was
set.”
“ Set?” Asa was rigid. Tope,
watching him , thought the m an used
an effort to control his voice.
“ W'hy?”
“ To kill Mr. and Mrs. H urder,”
said Inspector Heale harshly.
For a long moment there was silence.
Chief Mason moved away,
back to the fire. Asa stood thoughtful,
with bowed head. Then his eyes
shifted, and he looked past Inspector
Heale, and called in a low tone:
“ R a b ! ”
Inspector Tope swung around in
time to see R ab Taine coming toward
them from the direction of Uie
old barn.
“ Hullo,” he said in a level monotone.
“ What’s the matter, A sa?”
And Asa told his brother: T his
is Inspector Heale. He thinks the
fire was set, to kill G randm a and
Grandpa H urder.’*
Tope watched R ab intently.
“ Set?” the young m an exclaimed.
“ K ill? For heaven’s sake, why
should anyone—” He stared from
one to another. “ Why should anyone
do th a t?” he demanded.
“ Same reason someone killed
Mrs. Leaford,” said Heale im placably;
and R a b cried:
“ Aunt Kitty? Why, she took an
overdose—”
But Heale said grim ly: “ Oh, she
was killed, all right.” There was
something like a harsh trium phant
relish in his words. “ Murdered,
Taine! And so were these old folks
tonight. Or Mrs. Hurder, anyway.
Mr. Hurder may get well.”
“ For heaven’s sake,” R ab protested,
“ if you thought that about
Aunt Kitty, why haven’t you done
something before now? Why haven’t
you said so before? You m ight have
prevented this to night!”
Inspector Heale confessed: “ I figured
there’d be a better chance of
finding out—*’
“ Blast i t ! ” R ab cried. “ You’ve
fiddled around with your figuring;
and now— You’re as bad as—”
But Asa interposed reasonably:
“ Steady, Rab. I guess Inspector
Heale used his best judgment. After
all, he couldn’t be sure Kitty was
poisoned. Maybe her heart cracked,
let go.”
He added: “ And this tonight may
have been an accident. You ca n ’t
tell.”
Inspector Heale asked Asa:
“ Where were you, tonight?”
Asa looked at him slowly, then
grinned. “ You cross-examined me
once before, Inspector,” he remarked,
in a dry amusement. “ Tonight?
I was asleep on the couch in
the dining-room next door.” He nodded
toward the Bowdon house.
“ Asleep, eh?”
“ Till Mother woke me, yes."
“ Where was she?”
“ With Grandm a Bowdon.**
“ Dressed, were you?”
“ Shoes off, and coat,** Asa answered.
R a b interrupted: “ Asa. you said
they questioned you before? You
knew what they thought about Aunt
K itty ?”
“ They told me, yes,” Asa explained.
ivab cried: “ Then why didn’t you
tell u s?”
But Tope, in the background, suggested
m ildly :
“ I hear you were in Providence
tonight, Mr. Taine.”
R ab stared at him almost truculently.
“ What of it? ” he demanded
and turned away.
“ Do you m ind my questions,
A sa?,” Tope asked.
“ No,** Asa assured him. “ Anything
you like.”
“ Mrs. Leaford leave a w ill?’*
“ No.”
“ Mr. Bowdon? Mr. Hurder?**
“ Yes, of course.”
“ What were the terms?**
Asa looked at him thoughtfully;
and he glanced at Inspector Heale.
He said: “ 1*11 tell you anything I
can, but I can’t help you on that.
My father drew the wills. You’ll
have to ask h im .’*
“ Where is he?” Inspector Heale
demanded. “ Where was he tonig
ht?”
Asa smiled faintly. “ He w’ent to
sleep in a kitchen chair after supper,”
he explained. “ Mother found
him still asleep there when she
went to telephone R a b .’*
“ Asleep through all this hullabaloo?”
“ He’s stone deaf, you know.**
Tope asked gently: “ Taine, if one
of the connections d id n’t do this,
who did? Anyone live around here
who might? J im Glovere, or the
Thayers?”
He saw Asa taut and stiff, like a
fencer on g u a rd ; but before he could
reply, R ab spoke at Tope’s elbow.
The young m an had returned unseen,
and he said in the tone of one
conveying an order that must be
obeyed:
“ My mother wants a word with
you gentlemen. Please follow m e.’*
Without the slightest hesitation,
Tope moved briskly after Rab.
Heale almost reluctantly followed
him , but Asa stayed behind.
When Tope and Inspector Heale
followed R ab into the house where
lamps were burning to replace the
now useless electric lights, there
was stir and movement behind the
closed doors of the dining-room in
which Denman Hurder still lay unconscious
and near death; and the
parlor doors likewise were closed.
But Mrs. Bowdon and Mrs. Taine
waited for them in the sitting-room;
and Mrs. Bowdon was in a chair
that faced the door by which they
entered. Tope had an impression
of mass, of a white mass that would
not easily be moved. Her hair was
white; so was her cheek; so was the
shapeless dressing gown she wore.
She sat in a ponderous immobility
which had nevertheless a suggestion
of power held in restraint; and
her eyes were alive and hard and
cold.
Mrs. Taine, on the other hand,
met them at the door. This was a
spare, thin wom an; her thin hair
was black; her cheek was sallow;
her lips were thin. She spoke in a
soft sibilance, in keen syllables that
suggested the slicing stroke of ra
zor-blades.
“ I sent for you gentlemen,” she
told them simply. “ My son tells
me you are circulating the suggestion
that Mrs. Leaford’s death, and
the tragedy tonight, were not accident
but design. I will not permit
such nonsense. I f such rumors become
current, I shall know whom
to blame, and I will hold you both
responsible. Let the talk end here
and now. I bid you good day.”
Inspector Tope waited for Inspector
Heale to speak. R ab exclaimed,
in a restrained anger:
“ You heard her, gentlemen. That
is a ll.”
And when Heale still was silent,
Mrs. Bowdon said, without moving
her lips: “ Outrageous. Impudent
audacity. Clow'ns.”
“ One thing more,” Mrs. Taine remembered.
“ Mr. Clinton Jervies
took June Leaford aw ay with him,
against m y express wish. She must
be back here in the morning We
take care of our own, we Kenesaws;
we ask no favors anywhere.
See to it that this is done, or I
shall know what steps to take.”
Heale remained m u te ; but Tope
suggested gently: “ How old ia
Miss Leaford, m a ’a m ? ”
Mrs. Tame looked at him. Most
people were somewhat melted by
Tope’s m ild kindliness, but she was
not. “ She is of age, yes,” she said
calmly. “ But that is immaterial.
She is an inexperienced child, quite
incompetent to decide things for
herself. Kitty Leaford was no fit
mother for her, but I have done my
duty by June, and will continue to.**
But Inspector Heale found his
tongue at last, forgetting his awe
of these two women in remembrance
of his duty and his rights.
“ Now, wait a m inute,” he insisted.
“ You folks on the H ill have gone
your own gait in a lot of things;
but this looks like m urder to me,
and it’s my duty to check up on it.
Some questions I want to ask you.
I know you’re feeling pretty had
right now, so if you want to wait
till morning—”
Mrs. Bow'don said heavily: “ There
is nothing I can tell you. My husband
lies dead in the house. I wish
to be alone.”

Personality W ill Determine the Best
Vocation to Follow, Says Physician
In keeping civilization going, the
introverts—those persons whose interests
are mostly personal—furnish
most of the ideas; the extraverts,
or socially minded people, turn the
wheels, Paul Popenoe declares in
his article “ Extravert or Introvert?”
in the November Hygeia.
Temperamental differences are of
vital importance in vocational guidance,
m any a maladjustm ent of
adult life being due to the fact that
an extravert is trying to do an introvert’s
job, or vice versa.
On the whole, extraverts naturally
tend to succeed best in occupations
that bring them into contact
with other people and that demand
aggressiveness, decision and action,
latroverts will be found predominantly
in places where they can
work alone and in creative fields,
such as art, science and literature.
An extravert girl might fail as a
sculptor but succeed adm irably as
a teacher of art to large groups of
people. An introvert who goes into
law will not be likely to win fame
as a jury lawyer but will naturally
gravitate into office work.
In the fam ily, each plays a different
role, and each must be treated
accordingly. One is as good as the
other; but one is by no means the
same as the other. Successful parenthood
will take account of the
differences.
The extravert child will please
his parents by making a good social
adjustment without any special
help; he will make good marks
without much effort, will take the
leadership in school activities, will
be popular with associates because
always ready with a joke or retort.
The introvert i s usually the opposite
of all this. His interest and
attention are turned inward rather
than outward. He is more concerned
with his own thoughts than
with what is going on around him
outside. He will be modest, unassuming,
cautious, critical, persevering.
O H , F O R a dress that is cool to
wear on hot sultry days, warm
and “ comfy” to wear on cool days,
a dress that somehow or other possesses
the magic of fitting into the
scheme of things, whether it be going
places about town during the active
hours of the day or doing more
or less of a society stunt at informal
bridge party or tea in the afternoon
at the club.
The answer? Well, here it is right
before your very eyes in the accompanying
illustration — dresses
that are hand-crocheted of mercerized
cotton. Yes’m, a dress like
either of the models pictured will
prove a friend in need and indeed
at any time of the year. As to
solving the mid-season problem
of something to wear that tides over
the gap between fashions old and
fashions new, you’ll find a handcrocheted
dress gives the perfect
answer. Such a gown is correct
and likable to wear this very m inute
and for the girl who will be faring
to school in the early autumn
days.
The best way of putting to the test
all we have been saying about the
crochet theme is to make such a
dress for yourself. Ju s t a few leisure
moments devoted here and
there, that would otherwise be wasted,
to the crocheting thereof and in
an unbelievably short time you will
be the exultant possessor of a dress
that will prove a treasure in your
wardrobe, the whole year round.
Want to try it? Well, here’s how!
—go to your nearest fancy work
shop or department. There you will
find oodles of mercerized crochet
cottons in adorable colors. However,
that once done, together w'ith
the acquiring of exactly the right
size crochet hook, not forgetting to
ask for a pamphlet of instructions
as how to make, which is always
available where you buy yarns.
There’s good news for crocheters .
this year in that the idea of styling
is being played up for all it is
worth. For the first time crochet
has been treated like fabric. The
result is a collection of crocheted
dresses unmatched for smartness,
wearability, fit and individuality.
Most important is the way in
which the newer crocheted frocks
fit and mold the figure. Dressmaker
touches are also stressed. Padded
shoulders are emphasized, zipper
closings are used, skirts swing
gracefully, with a view to achieving
the young look so much exploited
this season.
Typical of the new crochet fashions
is the casual, neat-as-a-pin
dress as shown to the left in the picture.
A decorative zipper down the
front, closing at the throat with two
pompoms, high-placed pockets and
a wide contrasting belt give it the
dressmaker touches. Even the belt
is crocheted. Worked in lustrous
mercerized crochet cotton, the entire
outfit is simple to make.
The hand-crocheted dress to the
right has the stylish look. Its lines
are fluid and soft with the shoulders
slightly exaggerated to slenderize
the silhouette, making it graceful
for the more mature figure as well
as for the slim and svelte young
woman. The stitch is open and lacy
—delightfully cool to wear throughout
the summer. Later on you will
find this type gown an ideal starter
for the fall wardrobe.

Designer Visions
Coining Fashions
Quoting Edith Head, top designer
of clothes for Hollywood notables:
“ The reign of the popular simple
frock or suit is over. Everything
indicates that the fall and winter
styles will be lavish in fabric and
extremely romantic and flattering.
Clothes will doubtless cause social
functions to increase in formality
and it will be, all and all, a dressy
season.”
“ I am sure,” predicted Miss
Head, “ that there will be no certain
or definite skirt, sleeve, or coat
lengths in the coming trend. Women
will dress strictly to their own
individuality, getting away from the
‘sheep’ fads and crazes which made
all of us look alike for the past several
years. At least feminine
fashions will assume something
else than ’all poured of the same
mold.’
"The high note of the new trend,”
said the designer, “ will be magnificence
of material. Silks, brocades,
velvets, and embroidered fabrics
will be abundant and tailored, allpurpose
models will hear a definite
death knell.”
The London Temple
The term. Temple, is used in
England to refer to the buildings in
which barristers and law students
reside. The two societies. Inner
Temple and Middle Temple, are two
of the four Inns of Court established
in early times for the study and
practice of law. They occupy the
sites of the buildings of the Order
of Knights Templars in Englar.a.
Rich Silk Fabrics
For Coats, Suits
It is with an eye to the future
that women are buying the smart
new coats now showing ln the m id summer
collections, made of rich
silk fabric. A costume of the handsome
bengaline.-, and such will carry
through until the "frost is on
the p um pkin." The appeal of these
handsome suits is not to be withstood
by best dressed fashionables.
Red Dots White
Still the rage for polka dots goes
on. In the picture it is white silk
chiffon with red polka dots that
fashions a most captivating evening
dress. For country club wear
and city roofs under starlit skies
with music in the air here is the
gown ideal. The halo hat in tones
of red matches the kid belt which is
tied with a fabric bow. The bracelet
is the new-type bubble glass that
glitters in prismatic colors.

0 According to ancient English
legend, rain on ■‘its S u ith in ’s
Pay, July 15, means rain for 40
days. The folk lore of every
country imbues animals, fo u l
and insects with the gift of foretelling
rain. Ilere are a few of
the more popular superstitions:
BASEBALL
TRUE!
Despite meteorologists, many
farmers here and elsewhere listen
to the rooster's crowing for advance
weather information. This superstition
is based on the age-old couplet:
“ If a cock crows when he goes to
bed, he'll get up with a wet head.”
V
vn.
Another "sure-fire" indication of
rainfall, fishermen to the contrary,
is when “ Through the clear streams
the fishes rise, and nimbly catch
incautious flies.”
Government weather experts look
npon kitty as nothing more than a
household pet, but according to diehards,
rain is a twoto-one bet when
“ Pass on the hearth, with velvet
paws, sits licking o'er her whiskered
Jaws.”
v —
The not-too'partirular housewife
ean disregard scientific prognostications.
according to legend, because
rain is definitely due when "The
soot falls down, the spaniels sleep,
and spiders from their cobwebs
creep.”

Wittenber* Wins at Elderon
The veteran, Joe Petcka, went to the
mound for the first time for the Pilots
Sunday and gave the finest exhibition
of pitching seen in this league for a
long time, limiting the hard hitting
Elderon team to two scattered hits and
shutting them out 3 to 0. Only twenty-
nine batters faced Petcka, whose
control was perfect; he did not grant
one base on balls, and struck out fourteen
batters.
The Pilots scored all their runs in
the first inning off W'anta, who then
steadied and held the Wittenberg
sluggers scoreless.
Henry Wolff led the Wittenberg attack
with three hits, and Donnie
Gunderson. Pilot star shortstop, turned
*n a back-hand catch off the bat of
Merlin Thiede, that was spectacular.
Next Sunday Kelly, the Wittenberg
• inx, comes here and a real game can
he expected. Last Sunday Kelly was
defeated by the league leading Wausau
team in ten innings 3 to 2.
The Kelly team has been bolstered
up considerably with the addition of
Young. Arnold, Maeck and Drews, and
is now strong enough to defeat any
team in the league. Fans, do not miss
this one; it will be a irame not to be
forgotten for a long time.

Badgers Take Birnamwood
Eland defeated Birnamwood Sunday
in a game that showed the “woods” as
a greatly rejuvenated team.
Mel Strong held the invaders to two
hits, both secured in the 8th. Gowell
pitched the 9th inning, and no hits
were made off his delivery.
Only two of the Badgers’ runs were
earned.
Elderon invades the local premises
next Sunday, and this should be a
whale of a game.

People of Wittenberg Discover
Amazing Relief for Kun-l)own,
D nm rr , Half-Alive Feeling. —
('aused by Acid Stomach and
Lazy Elimination.
Enthusiastic men and women tell
their neighbors and friends about this
remarkable medicine— Williams Formula!
Every day more and more people
are discovering this sensible way to
relief from the painful discomfort of
stomach gas, acid indigestion and that
old, achey feeling caused by lazy elimination.
Many well-known residents
who have been suffering from sickheadaches,
nervousness, dizziness and
the “half-alive” feeling, declare they
hardly believe the remarkable relief
they have experienced from taking
Williams Formula. “ I f I had only
known about W’illiams Formula years
ago/ one woman said, “what a difference
it might have made in my life.”
Similar words of praise for this fam ous
medicine are heard on every side,
and a veritable torrent of enthusiastic
letters continue to pour in from grateful
users.
One such letter was recently re-
MR. WM. L. EVANS
ceived from Mr. Wm. L. Evans, widely
knewn property owner of Fond du
Lac, w is. What he has to say should
be of interest to every similar sufferer
in this vicnity.
“ I have experienced considerable1
sour gas pains and constipation. Many i
foods I would eat would sour and form
a great deal of gas and I would bloat.
I have also been troubled with lazy i
bowels. Some time ago, I decided to
try W illiams Formula, and I can surely
say that I can eat many foods now
and Williams Formula has a definite
stimulant action on my bowels.”
Williams Formula is a compound of
Valuable Herbs and other recognized
ingredients, put up by a registered
pharmacist, the same man who would
fill a prescription for you.
If you are sufferng from spells of
dizziness, sick headaches, nausea,
poor appetite tired-out run-down, halfsick
feeling due to acid stomach, poor
elimnntion or iron-poor blood, you
owe it to yourself and family to try
Wiliams Formula. Ask your druggist
to tell you more about this famuos
medicine which thousands of people
ovre the country are using every day.
Williams Formula is sold at all
better drug stores in three economical
sizes to suit your convenience.
It costs only a few cents a day to
take and may be worth $10 a bottle
to you for' the relief it gives. Call at
this drug store today, get a bottle of
Williams Formula and start taking it
now.

AN EXPERIMENT IN
TH E R E 'S an old story I have al- I
way* liked. It is about the parsimonious
Frenchman who rued the
money he spent in feeding hia horse.
After scheming and planning he
hit upon an idea which would enable
him to stop all that.
It was beautifully simple: Each
day he would gradually cut down
the amount of feed
he gave the horse.
He would out it
down ao gradually,
in fact, that the anim
a l wouldn't ever
realize he waa being
cheated.
The hors* would
thus become used to
getting along on
leas. Eventually he
would need no feed
at all. Think of the
money that would
save I
The French genius scientifically
set about carrying on the experiment.
Several months later he was
telling about it with pride in his
voice. Did it work? asked a friend.
"Work? Oh, yes, indeed, it d id !”
he exclaimed. " I t worked perfectly.
Beautifully. The only trouble
was that just about the time my
horse got used to going without feed,
he died.”
We laugh at thr benighted condition
of a man with an idea aa fooliah
aa this, but many business men
try to stop feeding their business
“ horse” by eliminating or cutting
down on their advertising.
The fact is that advertising is the
feed which keeps their business in

robust health and full of energy and
strength.
Many examples can be cited of
the inevitable result of stopping advertising.
Two will do Forty years
ago there was a remedy on the m arket
which was America’s biggest
seller. It was widely, intelligently,
consistently advertised. Its name
was a household word. Then the
founder of the business died. His
heirs decided to cut out advertising
because “ our product is so well
known people will have to buy it.”
The product passed out of the picture
entirely.
Another was a fine, honest, wellmade,
well-advertised toilet soap,
with all the good will any product
could possibly need. The management
of the business changed. The
advertising stopped. Soon the product
was no longer on the market.
The reason why advertising must
be a continuous process is that we
human beings need constant reminding.
We're not fickle. But we are
so filled with our own ideas and
plans and businesses that if a man
who wants our trade doesn't ask for
it regularly and often, we drift elsewhere
to th* man who does.
The advertiser is faced by the
problem of asking his customers to
buy from him , but he also has to
consider the most economical way
of extending his invitation.
lie finds the answer to both parts
of this problem In the newspaper.
No other form of advertising has
ever been discovered which will
earry his message so effectively for
ao little cost.

most of America expects its warmest
weather• although the sun has
already started its return trip to
the southern hemisphere. But enterprising
arul uninhibited Americans
have found many wayt to
escape the heat. For example: In
Detroit (above) as in many other
crowded cities $w cl ter ing citizens
congregate around spraying hydrants.
This method is most popular
in New York's tenement district.

Peter Pond, Pathmaker
T H E Y say that when Peter Pond
was born to the wife of a M ilford,
Conn., shoemaker in 1740 he
“ arrived in a restless mood” and
from that tim e until the end of hia
life he was constantly on the go.
His father wanted him to “ stick to
the last” but the boy’s restlessness
led him into the British arm y at the
age of 16. He served under Lord
Howe, Sir W illiam Johnson and General
Amherst in Canada and there
learned of the wealth of the country
he was helping to conquer. It was
furs and he was destined to become
one of A m e rica’s greatest fur traders.
After the French and Indian war
was over, he went to sea and after
a successful voyage to the West Indies
returned to Milford to find his
mother dead. So he took charge of
his eight younger sisters and brothers
until his father returned from a
trading trip to Detroit. *
When his father died Peter assumed
his debts and in 1765 went
to Detroit to engage in the Indian
trade. He spent one winter at Michillim
ackinac, then “ took another
turn to ye West Indies.” But he was
soon back in the West—at P rairie
du Chien and Green Bay, Wis.
About 1775 he gave up the trade
in the Mississippi valley and went
up into C anada. He is said to have
been the first white man to reach
the Peace river country and when
the North West company was organized
in 1784 he was one of the
shareholders. He helped wrest the
valuable Chipewayan trade away
from the Hudson’s Bay company
and he inspired the famous exploring
expedition of Alexander Macken-
| zie to the Pacific. Pond sold out
his interests in the North West com pany
in 1790 and is said to have died
in poverty a few years later.

A Dumas Hero
\\7HEN Irish-born Thomas Phe-
* * lan died in Bremerton, Wash.,
in 1909, at the age of 72 it marked
the passing of a character who
m igh t have stepped out of one of
Dumas' novels. When he was 21
Phelan came to America, seeking
adventure, and arrived in Kansas
in time to take part in the border
wars as a follower of John Brown
of Osawatomie.
In Jackson county, Mo., he was
captured by pro-slavery bushwhackers,
who shot h im and left him for
| dead. Upon recovering, he enlisted
j in the Union arm y, rose from sergeant
to the rank of captain and
served throughout the Civil war.
| Once he and several of his company
were captured by QuantriU’s guer-
! rillas and sentenced to be shot.
1 Their lives were saved by a Fed-
; era! com m ander wbo threatened to
hang an equal num ber of Southern
j sympathizers if they were harmed.
After the war, Phelan, with his
| sword-cane, was a picturesque figj
ure on the streets of Kansas City
| where he became noted for his skill
| as a swordsman and his readiness
to settle any quarrel ou the duelling
I grounds with rapier or pistol. Then
he enlisted in the flght for Irish
freedom, joined the F enians but
quarreled with some of their, leaders
because of their terroristic
methods. As a result, three “ d
m iters” in 1885 attacked him in h:
office and almost slashed him to
death with their daggers before he
beat them off. After many months
in the hospital he finally recovered
from his wounds.
In 1894 Phelan won international
fame when the French captain, Alfred
Dreyfus, was courtmartialed
and sentenced to Devil’s Island.
Phelan im mediately denounced
Count Esterhazy as the forger of
the documents which convicted
Dreyfus and challenged him to a
duel. The charges of the Irish soldier
of fortune were ridiculed but
later events proved that he was
right.

‘Thirty-Thirty’ Jack
BACK in 1898, when Ja c k P ratt
was 26 years old, he left the
States for Alaska and settled near
Wiangell. There was no monotony
in his far-north life—he became a
deep-sea diver, prospector, game
hunter, "m o u n tie ,” saloon-keeper
and government agent. They called
him ‘•Thirty-Thirty” Jack after the
rifle he carried instead of the usual
I six-shooter.
Up in Nome, for a while he went
into partnership with Tex Hickard,
the famous pme-fight promoter.
; Their business interests were centered
solely in running a saloon,
so instead of promoting fights, they
were interested in stopping them.
There, too, ■■Thirty-Thirty'' knew
many later notables including Kex
Beach, Robert W. Scrvice. Texas
Uuinan and Ja c k London.
A tew months ago he made a
trip to Chicago which was his first
return to “ civilizatio n” in 38 years.

‘Clothed in Gold’
A gold-plated silk fabric is described
in Industrial and Engineering
Chemistry. A silk dress
is impregnated with a solution of
a gold salt, which is then decomposed
chemically, leaving a
coating of pure gold upon the fiber,
at a cost of about $3 per yard.
When ihe dress is worn out, the
gold can be recovered and used
again. The garment was recently
exhibited in E ngland.

HE A D L I N E S F R OM THE LI VES
OF PEOP LE LI KE Y O U K S E L F I
“Breath of Doom”
He l l o e v e r y b o d y :
John A. Kollins of Decatur, 111., is a refrigerator repairman,
and he knows the ins and outs of mechanical refrigerating
systems and can tell you just what makes them go.
John learned that business with an eye to making his bread
and butter out of it. (But there came a time when he had to
use every doggone bit of the knowledge he had acquired—to
save his life.
But, in the end, it was a penknife that saved the day. Without
it, all of John’s technical skill would have been of little use
in the battle' against the icy breath of doom which he and his
helper found themselves fighting, John’s knowledge told him
what not to do, but knowing what not to do isn’t enough when
death is clamping' down and slowly wringing the life out of you.
It all happened in Springfield, 111. On March 31, 1936,
John Kollins was called over there to make some repairs in
the refrigerating plant of the Morris Fish Market. He got
there early in the morning with his helper, and they worked hard all
day on the job.
The market had several cooler rooms carrying below-freezing temperatures
and one room, called a sharp fish freezer, that went down
to 10 or 15 degrees below zero when the machinery was working.
Evening was coming on, and still their job wasn't finished.
The market had closed and every one had gone home before John
finally got the machinery working properly, lie still had to test
it, though, and he turned the controls on full and he and his
helper climbed out of the basement and went up through the big,
empty market to the sharp freezer room to see how rapidly the
machine was bringing the temperature down.
Find Catch Broken on Freezer Door.
When they got to the freezer door, John noticed again that the
catch was broken. There was an old pair of ice tongs hanging
nearby, to open it in case it stuck. He had seen that before, and

“ What are you talking about?”

The first lad nodded. “ I know,"
he admitted. “ That’s what makes
it so am azing.”

The sentry challenged the uniformed
figure that had entered the
camp.
“ Major Jones," came the reply.
“ Sorry, sir,” said the sentry.
“ 'F ra id 1 can’t let you proceed

“ Drat it, m an, I'v e forgotten i t ! "
snapped the other. “ But you know
me well enough.”
"C a n ’t help it, s ir ," persisted the

made a mental note of it. He had even told his helper to be careful
in closing that door behind him . But now, as John walked in, his
helper, following behind him , gave the door a thoughtless bang.
Locked in ! And in a small, cramped room whose temperature
was rapidly going down! Going to 15 below zero!
Not even an Eskimo could live through a night in the open
a t such a temperature, and John and his helper, dressed in
ordinary working clothes, knew that they’d be frozen to death
long before morning.
“ My heart almost failed me right then and there,” says John, “ but
If it hadn’t been for m y knowledge of the structure of this freezer, we
might have died before we even had half a chance to try to get out.
My helper was all for taking a big block of ice and trying to ram
the door down, but I knew better than to try it. The door was too
strong, and, if we failed to get out on the first try, it would be the end.
“ I had built this plant eight years before. I knew the am*
monia coils would not stand much jarring without springing a
leak. And once the ammonia got in, we’d have choked to
death before we had a chance to freeze/'
No— that was out. The only thing those two lads could do was
cling to straws. They M IG H T just possibly be alive in the morning.
Only Tool Is Two-Bladed Penknife.
John asked his helper if he had any tools in his pocket. The only
thing the helper had was a sm all penknife with two blades.

hour they kept up their intermittent shouting. John was
fig “ Police.” and his helper was just crying “ H e lp !” It was almost
'10 o'clock by that time, and John had lost all hope. And then, suddenly,
they got an answer.
“ Where are you?” A m an, parking his car in the alley beside the
market, had heard them.
The fellow broke in a window, found the freezer, and used the old ice
tongs to pry open the door.
“ lie didn't know what to do about us,” says John, “ until I,
ln my delirium , began yelling ‘Police!’ again. He thought that
was a good idea and called the cops."
The police arrived and gave the two men stimulants. Before it was
over, the newspaper photographers had arrived and they had to go
back into that freezer again to pose for pictures. But that time they
m ade darned certain that the door wouldn't slam shut on them.

Virtually All Beach
Although Denmark is less than
one-third the size of Florida, this
kingdom has no less than 168 bathing
resorts. The temperature of the
waters in summer is about the same
as that off the south of England, it
is said. The North sea side of Ju tland—
the m ainland of Denmark—is
virtually one continuous sand beach.
The Baltic side of Jutland and all
the islands also are dotted with
bathing places.
Korean Headdress
Korean women can carry their
wardrobes in their hats. The head
coverings, worn by these women,
are tent-shaped and so large they
completely cover the wearer to the
waist. Upon occasion they can be
used as baskets. Hats and pocketbooks
are combined by the women
of the Igorrote tribe of the Philippine
islands. Cigarettes, money,
and cosmetics are carried in the
pockets of these girls’ hats.

Do you expect people to believe

For a help-yourself-party (or almost
any other lunch or supper) few
foods rival in popularity a platter
of “ cold cuts.” Designed to tempt
the appetite, and to provide interesting
variety, this good-to-look-at
and good-to-eat dish is a summer
favorite.
Salami, liver sausage, thin slices
of flavorsome boiled h am , and
corned beef or
sandwich slices
make an attractive
and delicious
combination. Wafer-
thin slices of
c h e e s e , s m a l l
sweet pickles and
radish roses with
sprigs of watercress complete the
platter.
These same cold meats have other
uses, too. For example, cubes of
salam i add zest to a green salad,
corned beef makes a tasty casserole
meal, and slices of boiled ham
combine with cream cheese and
chives to make a tempting and
unusual dish for lunch or supper
plates.

new interest to your meals. I hope
they may inspire you to do a little
experimenting on your own.

A vacuum cleaner with a clean
dust bag does the best cleaning job,
studies at Purdue university experiment
station show. For best service
the bag should be emptied after
each daily use. Never wash the
bag, as that destroys the finish that
keeps it dustproof.
How much dust a machine draws
from a rug, the studies indicate depends
partly on how fast it is pushed
back and forth. Most machines
clean best if they are moved at a
speed of from one to two feet a
second.
Naturally, the machine should not
be allowed to pick up pins, tacks, or
glass because these sharp objects
may poke holes in the bag or chip
the fan blades.
It is also desirable to keep the
machine in a clean place, protected
from dirt and dust.

T H E H O U S E
Many Electric Outlet*
Important to Kitchen
When electric outlets are being
planned in a new house for lamps,
clocks and radios, the kitchen is
often neglected. It has more uses
for plugs than any other room.
Within reasonable limits, there
cannot be too many appliance outlets
in the kitchen. In this room
electricity is used both for lighting
and for motivating power.
Consumption of current varies
widely with kitchen appliances, and
special attention should be given to
the load the outlet is expected to
carry.
Just Sterilize Containers
To Prevent Ropy Bread
“ Ropiness” in bread is caused by
a bacillus and it makes the bread unfit
for use. All containers in which
the bread was mixed, baked, and
stored should be sterilized by boiling.
Ropiness in bread does not develop
immediately after the bread
has been baked, but announces itself
by a disagreeable odor.
To Inform You.—Read the labels
on canned foods. Many tell the
number of slices contained in the
can. Others give additional useful
information about the contents.
• • •
Keep Oils Cool.— Store oils, such
as olive or vegetable, in the refrigerator.
They are likely# to become
rancid when opened unless
they are kept chilled.
• • •
Quick Baking.—Fruit and berry
pies with lattice-style tops require
less baking time than the regular
two-crust pies.
• • •
Position of Trellises.—Trellises
should be a foot to 18 inches away
from a wall. This gives air a
chance to circulate and gives you
a chance to spray the back of the
vine.
• • •
Use for Leftovers.—Leftover
rice or macaroni mixed with
cooked meat makes a good filling
for green peppers or tomatoes.
The latter need to be cooked only
20 minutes in a moderate oven.
• • •
Stains on Ash Trays.—To remove
cigarette stains from brass
ash trays, rub the trays with a
paste of salt nnd vinegar. Then
wash them well in hot water and
soap suds.
• • •
Buying Hint.—Where pennies
must be counted it is wise to make
purchases that will mean less expense
to take care of them. Plain
bedding, such as spreads, pillowcases,
etc., is the only sensible
buy, as the frilled and fancy bed
linens cost nearly double to have
laundered than the plain ones and
mean quite an item to the household
expenses.
Well Mannered
To have faithfully studied the
honorable arts, softens the m anners
and keeps them free from
harshness.—Ovid.

To Remove Ja r Covers
To remove covers from preserve
jars place the ja r top downward in
a dipper of hot water (not boiling)
and allow it to remain five or ten
minutes. Remove the ja r from the
dipper and insert a steel kitchen
knife at different points under the
rubber. This will let in the air.
The cover can then be removed
easily.
On Washing Curtains
When washing curtains put dye or
tint in the washing machine with
the soap flakes. They color more
