Reject Sales Tax
A fte r months of rumors and specu
lation, trial balloons by insiders and
bad guesses by outsiders, the Republi
can administration’s tax program has
been made public. Republican legislators
meeting in caucus a fter a w eekend
o f deliberation o f s^les tax plans
originally submitted to them in tenta
tive form by Governor Heil decided
that they will balance the biennial
budget without resorting to a general
sales tax.
Although Governor H eil’s office a
few days earlier had released figures
explaining the proposed sales tax program
which showed the potential state
aids which such revenue would make
available fo r local property tax reduction,
the vote against the sales tax
was reported as unanimous. Governor
H eil’s voice was among the loud chorus
o f “ no’s” which downed the sales tax
method o f revenue production.
While the Republicans dropped the
general sales tax proposition as “ political
dynamite” — the • term used by
some o f the Republican legislative
leaders— the new program as evolved
by the financial advisors in the executive
office carries stiff levies on sales
o f commodities which are termed
“ non-essentials.”
$27,000,000 Bill
Republicans decided that the nonessentials
tax, coupled with a reenactment
and increase of old taxes, and
broadening o f the income tax base, is
the most feasible method o f solving
their pressing financial problem, a
problem of finding funds to match income
o f $45,000,000 with outgo of
nearly $73,000,000.
The revenue bill is based on the
$67,000,000 budget, plus an appropriation
o f $1,200,000 fo r Bang’s disease
indemnity payments to dairy farmers,
and a $4,000,000 relie f appropriation
yet to be made, or a total o f more
than $72,000,000 fo r the two years of
the Heil term.
Because that total is higher than
normal state expenditures in spite of
heavy cuts in several directions in
state departments, and because state
taxes are steadily shrinking, Republican
legislators discovered that they
had to raise a total o f about $27,000,-
000 in new revenue.
Hearings before the joint finance
committee w ere expected to begin immediately
on the follow in g ways of
doing it:
1. Low ering o f the income tax exemptions
from $8 for a single person
to $6 and from $17.50 fo r a married
> person to $15, and from $4 to $3 for
dependents.
2. Reenactment o f the privilege
dividend tax with a boost o f the present
2V i per cent top rate to four per
cent.
3. A tax o f 50 cents extra on a gallon
o f whiskey, raising the state tax
to $1.50 a gallon.
4. Increasing the tax on wine to 25
cents a gallon. The present levy is
10 cents on sweet wines and 8 cents
on sour wines.
5. A two cent per package tax on
cigarettes.
6. Elimination o f the $37.50 exemption
in the personal income surtax for
the teachers’ retirement fund, and
substitution o f a 15 per cent straight
surtax on the net normal tax.
7. Elimination of the teachers’ surtax
exemption of $75 on corporation
income taxes and substitution of a 20
per cent levy on the net normal tax.
8. Reenactment o f the chain store
tax and an increase in the top rate
from $100 to $250.
9. Reenactment of the 00 per cent
pension surtax and reduction o f all exemptions
on the same to conform with
the normal income tax exemptions.
10. Repeal o f the provision on capital
gains and losses in the 00 per cent
pension surtax law.
11. One half cent on cigars o f five
cents or less, one cent on cigars from
five to 12Vfe cents each, and two cents
on those from 12 Vi to 25 cents. Cigars
retailing at more than 25 cents would
be taxed three cents.
12. An increase in the malt beverage
tax from $1.00 to $1.50 a gallon.
13. A tax of $1.00 a gallon on sparkling
wines.
14. A tax on soft drink syrups o f
25 cents a gallon, which would amount
to about five a case of 24 six ounce
bottles of pop or soft drinks.
15. A three per cent occupational
tax on theater, amusement, and athle-!
tic contest admission receipts, exclusive
o f religious, high school or elementary
schools.
10. A two per cent tax on the full
value o f new cars, to be collected from
the purchaser at the time o f the is-i
suance o f the motor license. Other
“ non-essentials” taxes w ill be collected
by the state treasurer, who now receives
liquor and beverage revenues.
Biggest items in the 16 point program
— from the standpoint o f estim ated
revenue— are the dividend tax
revision, which w ill produce $4,000,-
000; the normal income tax exemption,
$600,000; the reenacment o f the 60 per
cent pension surtax, $4,000,000; cig a rettes,
$6,000,000; liquor, $3,250,000;
beer, $2,000,000; amusements, $600,-
000; soft drink syrups, $1,000,000; and
new autos, $1,800,000.
The new tax bill, designed to produce
a larger amount o f revenue than
has ever before been proposed at one
stroke in a Wisconsin legislature, inspired
much speculation by observers
this week. Because o f the va riety o f
interests which the taxes w ill affect,
intensive lobbying was anticipated
from the powerful industries which
will bear the brunt o f the tax load.
Other students o f state government
wondered about the potential encouragement
o f bootlegging activities
arising out o f the increased tax on
liquor and beer. State tax agents
have already pointed out that a majority
o f the state’s population lives
within easy driving distance o f states
where liquor can be purchased more
cheaply than in Wisconsin because of
lower taxes.
Income taxpayers were assured by
Governor H eil’s office that their new
tax bill will be accompanied by machinery
sim plifying payments, The
office also explained that the large
appropriation fo r Bang’s disease was
made necessary because since M ay of
this year the state has had to assume
50 per cent o f the Bang’s disease eradication
program, whereas earlier the
federal government had borne most o f
the expense of that work.

Tenure Repeal Fails
Repeal o f the 1937 teacher tenure
act, a subject which has been a fertile
source o f argument during the many
weeks o f the present session of the
legislature, was refused when the
state senate declined to agree with the
assembly in passing the repeal bill.
Thus it is probable that entire elimination
o f the job protection o f teachers
has been avoided for this year, a lthough
the Schenk bill, which will exempt
the one-room schoolhouse from
the terms o f the law awaits final action
and is given a chance for passage.

Mission Hill News
Many o f the local Indians enjoved
he Mission Movies Thursday evening
with the school children. The movies
have some additions and have been reedited
since last summer.
Hair raising screeches mode scalps
tingle on the hill one day last week.
Cause? A pert little grey mouse and
•i round brown teacher met midway in
the hall o f the employee’s building.
Teacher, with the afore mentioned
hair raising screeches, landed on all
fours in the middle o f room-mates’
bed— being careful to keep shoes off
the spread! Pert little Mr. Mouse sat
up on his haunches, twitched his
whiskers, and looked at Teacher who
waved a newspaper, clapped her hands
and cried “ shoo! shoo!” at the same
time repeating silently (according to
her own confessions afterw ards)
Burns’ immortal lines:
“ Wee, sleekit, cowrin’, tim’rous beastie
Oh, what a panic’s in thy breastie!”
Mr. Mouse, panic and all vamoosed.
Result ? The Superintendent bought
3 traps fo r a dime down town and
presented them to the frightened lady.
The lady herself drove to Wausau
Saturday and among other things
purchased 2 traps fo r a nickle; so she
set five traps in the room. Visitors
are warned whenever they move a
foot, “ Oh, look out! There’s a trap.”
Thus fa r no feet have beeti caught.
To date— one mouse.
Eugene Hanson nnd Norman Johnson,
son o f Rev. W. Johnson, o f Rosholt,
drove to Madison Saturday where
they made arrangements for the fall
term. Mr. Hanson has a fellowship
and will do graduate work at the U niversity

this week. We are grateful for all
gifts and thank the donors.
Rev. E. W . Sihler gave an illustrated

the one-hundredth anniversary o f
the coming of the Saxons to Perry

was delivered by Professor E.
Plass, of Concordia College, Milwaukee,
who used as his text Jude, verse

to write unto you of the common salvation,
it was needful for me to write
unto you, and exhort you that ye
should earnestly contend for the faith
which was once delivered unto the
saints.”

gymnasium was used fo r accommodating
the larger crowd that turned out.
Prof. A. Dede, also o f Concordia College.
delivered the sermon, which

European nations need not only

such w as the case last year, A dolf
H itler's aggression this spring added
m ilita ry domination to the already
pressing econom ic leverage.
Reason: A lread y boss of G erm any’*
m ighty Krupp works, Berlin captured
the even m ightier Skoda
plants when Czecho-Slovakia fell
before the conquerer. Until then
southeast Europe’s m inor nations
(like Rumania, G reece, Turkey and
Ju goslavia) had Skoda guns and
shells to w ard off the aggressive

bought by lesser nations only in exchange
fo r concessions.
A gg ra va tin g the situation i i the
Anglo-French rearm am ent program
, which demands dom estic
consumption o f all munitions produced
in those nations’ plants.
Lesser countries get none.
This forceful argum ent against
current U. S. neutrality legislation
was apparently saved for the crucial
moment. N ot offered ea rly this session
during house and senate com m
ittee hearings, it was plumped in
their laps unexpectedly by Secretary
o f State Cordell Hull just as
the two houses seem ed likely to g ive
neutrality an airing.
It seem ed a fa irly sound basis for
changing U. S. policy, isolationists
notwithstanding. Since the N azi
governm ent has becom e No. 1
source of m ilita ry supplies, m oreo
ver since practically continuous
Germ an m obilization aggravates
the situation, Mr. Hull joined N evada's
Sen. K e y Pittm an in demanding
repeal o f the neutrality act's
em bargo provision.
(T h it provision stipulates that once
the President finds a state of uar exists
in any foreign conflict, the sale of V . S.
arms and munitions is prohibitedJ
Best anti-em bargo argument:
That it actually places the U. S. in
a position o f co-operating with N azi
Germ any in freezing out sm aller nations
by depriving them of munitions.
On the surface less pressing when
w ar scares have tem porarily died
down, neutrality revision seemed
out of thc question if congress is to

and social security and

basis o f their a vera g e previous

tax accumulations:
Method. Under present rules, socia
l security taxes would rise from
1 per cent to 1% per cent against
both em ployer and em ployee on January
1, 1940; to 2 per cent in 1943;
2Vi per cent in 1946; and 3 per
cent in 1949. Probable revision:
Current 1 per cent rate against each
w ill be frozen for three years.
Results. A t present a w orker now
m aking $100 a month would get
nothing but a sm all lump sum settlem
ent in 1940. Under revisions,
he would begin getting $25.75 a
month if single and $38.63 if married.
Significance. By cutting payroll
contributions and boosting pensions,
congress w ill upset the elaborately
planned program for a $48,000,000,-
000 old-age reserve account by 1980,
scheduled to draw 3 per cent interest
as it grew through the years.
Proposed amendments, however,
are m erely being realistic about the
fact that the current $2,000,000,000
reserve is all I. O. U .'s from the
treasury, whose interest is paid by
borrow ing m ore money and thus
raising taxes.
COMMUNICATIONS:
Free Speech?
Fourteen U. S. radio stations are
“ international,” i.e., they direct
broadcasts to foreign continents
(ch iefly Latin A m e rica ) as w ell as
to home listeners. European stations
do likewise, but under govefnm ent
orders they propagandize program s
in a w ay that the U. S. Constitution
would forbid as an im pedim ent to
guaranteed fre e speech.
Surprised and puzzled, therefore,
w ere the 14 international stations
when Washington’s unpopular federa
l communications commission ordered
that beginning N ovem ber 1
their program s must “ prom ote international
good w ill, understanding
and co-operation.” When tim e comes
to renew their year-by-year licenses,
stations must show their program s
have reflected the “ culture o f this
country.”
What FCC denied was censorship,
nevertheless seem ed that w ay to

AGRICULTURE:
Downgrade
In booming 1929 U. S. gross farm
incom e w as $12,791,000,000. In depression-
ridden 1932 it w as less than
half, or $5,562,000,000. Returning
prosperity zoomed it to $10,350,000,-
000 in 1937. But in 1938, according
to bureau of agricultural econom ics
reports, it dropped again to $9,220,-
000,000.
This was not unexpected, since
farm income alw ays follow s the genera
l econom ic trend. Chief interesting
revelations: ( I ) That, contrary
to popular belief, the U. S. farm
problem is not confined to a few
m ajo r crops like cotton and w heat;
(2 ) that the $482,000,000 in U. S. subsidies
for 1938 was 31 per cent m ore
than in 1937 ($367,000,000), yet total
incom e went down anyway.
T w o possible deductions: (1 ) That
all the U. S. governm ent’s costly
fa rm relief measures have been ineffe
c tiv e ; (2) that on the contrary
they have been effective in bolstering
farm income during natural
“ o ff" years.

WASHINGTON —Insiders are convinced
that President Roosevelt, far
from having a change of heart on
the principle o f taxing undistributed
corporation profits at a higher rate
than those paid out in dividends, is
now working on a broad phase of
political strategy aimed at the pres-
I idential election next year.
The proof, they say, w ill be revealed
by com paring two speeches
ve ry carefully. The
first is that delivi
ered at the Am eril
can R eta il federation
banquet by
I President Roosevelt.
Th e second is the
outline fo r tax revision
aim ed at rev iving
business la id before
the house ways
and means com m ittee
by Secretary of
the Treasury Henry
Morgenthau Jr.
It w ill be noted that M r. M orgenthau
suggested repeal o f the last
vestige o f the special tax on undistributed
corporation earnings. It is
known that the President is privately
strongly against this revision. It
is further known that Morgenthau
would not think o f saying anything
publicly against his c h ie fs w ill.
The answer to this apparent contradiction
is that the President has
decided to g iv e business the opportunity
it has demanded— to revise
the tax law , or rather perm it its
revision, just as business spokesmen
have been urging.
Then, if business does not rev ive
spectacularly, if it does not absorb
m illions o f unemployed now on g o vernment
rolls o f one sort or another,
the President can say to the
country: "W e gave them everyth ing
they said they needed—even things
w e knew they ougnt not to have, in
order to test this thing thoroughly.
N ow w e know that business C A N N
O T or W IL L N O T function in such
a w ay as to take care o f this situation.
The governm ent, perforce,
must take care of these people. W e
cannot let them starve or freeze.
And we w ill not support them by
the dem oralizing dole.”
Netv Deal Starts A ll Over
A/rain With Critics Stumped
So the N ew Deal starts all over
again, with its critics deprived o f
the answer they have been m aking
fo r at least four years—that business
would revive if the governm ent
1 would just let it alone— knocked into
a cocked hat.
I f business should revive, the N ew
D ealers figure that “ r e fo rm " would
m erely be delayed until a fter the
i election. Actually they would like
1 to see this, not because they do not
believe their reform s are good, but
because the present business situation
has them considerably w orried.
Th ey are just a little disturbed by
the growing conclusion in the country,
as evidenced first in the purges,
then in the 1938 election, and m ore
recently by polls, that the N ew Deal
has not been so hot, in that it has
added billions to the national debt
while the number o f unemployed
apparently is as grea t as it was at
the depth of the depression.
Good times next y ea r would make
a D em ocratic victo ry, both as to
the presidency and as to congress,
much m ore likely. In fa ct plenty o f
shrewd observers think the Dem ocrats
w ill have to fum ble the ball
rather badly to lose the next election
if business is good and obviously
growing better. P a rties ra rely
lose elections in good times. It
is economic distress, almost invariably,
which beats the party in power,
i t one except the rare cam paign
in which som e issue m oves the
people m ore deeply than their pocketbooks.
Sometimes there is ve ry
little rhyme or reason in this, but
it is generally true.
M oreover the Republicans are not
in good shape, despite their astute
leadership on Capitol H ill. Th ey are
hopelessly divided on issues. Even
in congress this is apparent.
Mow Frank Murphy I.oomg
At New Oral White Hope
Attorney G eneral Frank Murphy
Is looming more and m ore as the
white hope o f the N ew D eal fo r the
presidential nomination next yea r
if Franklin D. R oosevelt does not
“ choose" to run. Murphy is the
third candidate to be trotted out by
the hundred percenters. Th e first
; was Robert H. Jackson, now solicii
tor general. Presiden t R oosevelt
was very anxious to have Jackson
i run fo r governor o f N e w Y ork, last
year.
Had Jackson run and been elected,
he would now be governor of
N ew Y ork, and in a position not only
, of be in able to do things, and keep
in the limelight, but o f having car-
I ried the E m pire state in a year
which w as not too good for thc
D em ocrats.
O f course, Jackson might not have
been elected had R oosevelt prevailed
on the leaders to nominate
him, but the interesting thing at
the m om ent is that the N ew York
leaders turned thumbs down on him,
and have never regretted their decision.
A fte r Jackson's elim ination—fo r It
could scarcely be considered anything
less— H a rry L. Hopkins becam
e the white hope o f the N ew
D eal. This m ovem ent involved also
a bit o f business appeasement. A t
the m om ent the N ew Dealers w ere
rather thoroughly convinced that
they must have a business rev iva l
if they w ere to be kept in power
a fter next year.
Then III Health Put Harry
Hopkins Out of Picture
T w o things happened to that. N o
one is sure precisely which of the
two w as the chicken and which was
the eg g , but one was that Hopkins
was out o f the picture on account o f
his health, and that w hile he was
out o f the picture the spenders and
business baiters clim bed into the
saddle again— and are still there as
this is written.
M aybe if Hopkins had been w ell
enough to fight fo r the program with
regard to business he certainly stood
for when he was seeking conform ation
as secretary o f com m erce
things would have been different.
Or m aybe if the N e w D ealers had
not becom e convinced that H a rry ’ s
constitution would not perm it the
strain of running fo r the presidency
things would have stayed put. It is
difficult to tell. Perhaps even Roosev
e lt does not know the answ er to
that.
Be that as it m ay, most N ew
D ealers w ill tell you confidentially
that they do not think Hopkins’
health permits his consideration fo r
the candidacy next year.
M eanwhile Murphy is busily engaged
not only in building him self
up before the country, but in doing
it in such a w ay as to overshadow
the sim ila r exploits o f Thom as E.
D ew ey.
President W ill Win Battle
To Continue Spending Policy
President R oosevelt w ill win the
battle he forecast in his address before
the A m erican R e ta il federation.
Th e spending policy w ill continue,
despite grum bling from conserva
tive leaders, not only among
the Republicans, but in the P re sident's
own party. T h ere w ill be no
reduction in the total taxes paid by
business. In fa ct there is likely to
be at least a sm a ll increase assuming
that there is any tax rev ision
at all. Some o f the nuisance
taxes on business m ay be repealed
or revised , but if they are then
the flat corporation income taxes
w ill be boosted, so that the net e ffect
w ill be to m ake successful com panies
pay m ore, though to ease the
burden slightly on unsuccessful com panies.
Th ere w ill be no m arked curtailment
o f governm ent competition
with business. U nem ployed w ill continue
to be aided by w ork relie f instead
o f by a dole, and social security
benefits w ill be g rea tly extended.
But in winning the battle Roosevelt
runs a serious risk of losing
the w ar. The ch ief reason why there
w ill be no balancing o f the budget,
in fa c t increased spending, is not in
sym pathy on Capitol H ill with the
President's economic theories, but
the age-old desire fo r pork, and the
necessity fo r logrolling to get it—
hence b igger and b ig g er appropriations.
Roosevelt Has Pork on
His Side for the Moment
This sentiment against spending
and the N ew D eal econom ic policies
is not strong enough, yet, apparently,
to insure revision o f government
spending. But it would be
tom orrow if the pork elem ent could
be elim inated. Thus R oosevelt has
pork on his side, fo r the moment,
but the b igger the pork spending the
m ore ea g er w ill the congressmen be
to sw at the next R oosevelt spending
proposal which is not sufficiently
greased. The d efeat by the senate
of the Florida ship canal is a perfect
exam ple o f this. Th e F lorida
senators did their utmost to include
the Florida canal in a logrolling
combination, and as a m atter of
fa ct had m ore success than appeared
on the final rpll call. But
Sen. Arthur Vandenberg did such a
good publicity job in branding this
p roject that even P a t Harrison,
whose state o f M ississippi is interested
in the canal, had to go to Sen.
Claude Pepper and beg to be excused!
Harrison had been m aking
quite a play against spending. To
have voted for this particular ex penditure
would have put him in
an inconsistent position, to put it
m ildly.
A ll o f which spells m ore strength
for the conservatives at the convention
next year
which w ill nominate
the D em ocratic candidate
for President.
It explains the enormous
apparent popularity
fo r John
Nance G arner, despite
G arn er's cloistered
vocal chords.
It explains the utter
collapse o f incipient
booms fo r every
N ew D ealer who has
been put forw ard as
R oosevelt's possible successor.
It explains the desperate efforts
o f the President to win Sen. James
F . Byrnes, who has been rather
vocal about the governm ent's spending
policy.

o f the abolished agency would be
combined w ith other state advertising
activities under a bill which sets
up the Wisconsin promotional department.
Plan Three Percent Sales T a x—
A n administration source reported
that plans had been launched fo r a
general three percent sales tax bill
intended to raise nearly $30,000,000
annually in new revenue. Financial
leaders, w ho have worked with Gov.
H eil on the tax program, expect that
the state w ill split the tax proceeds
w ith local government units which
in turn would use their approximate
$15,000,000 to low er general property
trxes. The remainder would be
taken by the state to balance the
budget.

simple common-sense "ounce of
prevention” ?
I f your trouble, like that of
millions, is due to lack of “ bulk"

eat K ellogg’s All-Bran. This
crunchy, toasted, ready-to-eat

C H A PTER IV
Inspector Tope and Miss Moss had
iound in marriage the calm happi*
aess of middle age. The Inspector
fead looked all his life on violence,
y e t w ith gentle, com prehending
« y e t . F or a score o f yea rs or m ore
b e w as at the head of the H om icide
B ureau at P o lice H eadquarters, and
w on fo r h im self there a reputation
not soon to be forgotten. M iss Moss
w as in a differen t fashion as shrewd
as he.
W hile they w ere aw ay on their
leisu rely honeymoon, C lint had
planned a surprise for them : Th ere
w as am ong the properties o f the
J erv ies Trust a one-story, six-room
house sandwiched on a narrow lot
in Longw ood, hidden in a backw ater
a w a y from the tra ffic a rteries, with
four trees on this lot, and room for
a flower-garden. Dana J ervies,
C lint's father, had taken his bride
there thirty y ea rs a go ; and he had
kept it afterw a rd for the sake of
sentiment. C lara and M a t lodged
in this house fo r a w hile a fter their
m a r r ia g e ; and when Inspector Tope
and M iss Moss cam e hom e from
their honeymoon, Clint m et them at
the station and d ro v e them to this
fa m ilia r door.
M iss Moss, with tears of pleasure
in her eyes, p rotested ; but Clint said
s tro n g ly :
"W h y , o f course you’ ll com e here.
T h is is w here all the J erv ies fa m ily
starts housekeeping, you know.
C an’t go against tradition.” And
when she argued she was not o f the
J erv ies fa m ily , he insisted gen tly:
“ Y o u 're the only m other I can
rem em b er, you know.”
She yielded at last, said they
would stay a little w h ile; but Clint
said they should lodge here till he
w anted the house fo r his own bride.
“ And that w ill be a long tim e, by
a ll the sign s," he prom ised.
On the m orning a fter C lint's ride
o v e r K enesaw H ill, he rang the bell
as they w ere about to sit down to
the breakfast M iss Moss had p rep
a red ; and Tope, in an old blue
dressing-gow n and slippers, the
m orning paper crum pled in his
hand, opened the door fo r him.
H e greeted C lin t; and he called
o v e r his shoulder:
“ M rs. Tope, h e re’s C lint for
break fa st.”
She appeared fo r a m om ent ln
the dining-room door to sm ile a
w elcom e, and bade them both sit
down at the table.
"A lm o s t rea d y ,” she promised.
She watched these tw o for a second,
a deep fondness in her eyes, before
she disappeared into the kitchen
again. When she presently returned,
w ith the coffee in one hand and a
p la tter o f eg g s and bacon in the
other. Tope said:
“ W ait, Clint. Start o v er now .”
And he (a id to M iss M oss: “ M r i.
T op e, Clint's had a curious adventure.
See how it sounds to you.”
And C lint told them how, drivin g
back to town, he had overtaken a
g ir l in her nightgown, ronning
through the rain upon that lonely
road. "N o w what do you m ake of
th at?” he asked, challenging them.
M iss Moss reflected. “ I know a
little about that place I” she told
them . " I know there are three
houses, side by side Matthew B ow don
live s in one. H e’ s a law yer,
trust law m ostly. Th e firm is B ow don
and Taine. Mr. Bowdon must
be an old m an now. T w o o f his
grandsons are in the firm with him,
and Justus Taine, his son-in-law.”
C lint excla im ed : "W e ll, w hat I
w ant to know is, who was this girl?
W hat had frightened her?”
Th e Inspector got up and crossed
to the telephone. “ I wonder if Charley
H arqu ail is downtow n,” he said.
" H e m ight know if anything has
happened out there.” C harley w as a
rep orter, and he and the Inspector
w e re old friends. Tope called the
new spaper office, and Miss Moss
and Clint listened to the one-sided
conversation.
When the old m an turned back to
them again, there w as a quickening
interest in his eyes; and Clint
caught him by the arm , dem anding:
"W h a t is it. Inspector? W hat did
H arqu ail s a y ? "
Tope sat down at the breakfast-table
again. “ I need another cup of
co ffee, Mrs. T o p e ," he said. “ T o
think this o v e r ." And w hile she
poured it, he began to explain:
“ Y ou heard m e ask C h arley if
Denman H u rder had any ch ildren ,”
he rem inded them ; and he chuckled.
“ T h at surprised C h a rley,” he
said, with a certain gratified vanity
in his tones. “ C harley wanted to
know how I got onto it, and I asked
him w hat he w as talking about.”
H e hesitated, said soberly: “ This
is w hat he told m e: M r. Hurder
had a daughter nam ed Katherine.
She eloped, twenty-odd yea rs ago,
with a man nam ed J erry Leaford .
L e a fo rd didn’t amount to much,
C h arley said. H e said there w as a
row at the tim e, and finally she
and L ea fo rd w ent hom e to liv e with

the tires, Clint looked attentively
at the three houses.
her fo lk s ; and then L ea fo rd left her,
and disappeared fo r good and a ll.”
H e added, and his tones w ere
som ber now : “ Th e reason C harley
had all this stuff so pat, Mrs. L e a ford
died last night, and he'd been
gettin g up an obit fo r h er.”
“ D ied ?” Clint cried. “ She w as
a live— "
“ I t w asn’t her you saw ,” Tope
rem inded him . “ She must have
been past fo rty now .”
“ Y ou asked som ething about
ch ild ren ? " Miss Moss prom pted.
“ I asked C harley if she had any
ch ildren,” Tope explained. “ H e
didn't know. Th ey just got a flash
about h er death, from the district
m an out th ere; and they w anted to
g iv e h er a good obit, because o f
course Hurder is a big advertiser.
C harley said the d istrict man was going
to g e t all the dope, children and
so on.” .
Thc others sat thoughtful, w atching
him ; and the Inspector w as silent
fo r a mom ent. H e said at
last with an apologetic glance at
M iss M oss:
" Y o u 'll think I'm seeing things at
night, but— there's something w rong
out th e r e !”
M iss Moss urged slow ly: “ Why
do you think so? Mrs. L ea fo rd was
sick, and the telephone w as out o f
order, and they sent someone for
a doctor. Isn 't that a ll? ”
Tope shook his head.
“ N o one runs fo r a doctor, no m atter
how big the hurry is, without
putting som e clothes on.”
“ What was the m atter w ith Mrs.
L ea fo rd ? ”
“ C h arley said heart trouble,”
Tope explained. “ But that co vers a
lot o f ground. I f a m an gets (h ot,
or (tab bed , he dies o f heart-trouble,
aa fa r aa that goea. H eart
fa ilu re w ill kill a peraon; y es. But
it takes something to m ake a heart
fa il. Takea quite a lot, too. These
hearts o f ours go on pumping pretty
steadily, unless something happens
to them . I'd like to know what
m ade her heart fa il.”
H e took up the telephone, and M iss
Mnss m oved to his side. "In s p e c t
o r ," she urged, " i t isn’t our business.”
H e sm iled at her. " L e t m e poke
m y nose in ,” he begged. “ I can’t
keep out o f a thing till I know.”
He used the phone for a w hile,
turned back to them again.
“ Th at was Inspector H ea le,” he
said. " A t H eadquarters out there.
H e hadn’t even heard about Mrs.
L ea fo rd being dead. 1 guess it's
nothing.” H e grinned at Clint.
“ Son ," he dem anded, “ what do you
m ean, com ing in here and stirring
us up this w ay? Can't a g irl go for
a w alk in her nightie along a country
road in the rain without starting so
much talk? I don’t b elieve there
w as any girl, anyway. How much
did you drink last night, young fe llow
?”
Clint chuckled. “ H ad one high
b a ll,” he confessed. " I t bores m e
to tea these kids lushing it up tha
w ay they do.” H e spoke to Misa
Moss. “ This g ir l I took home. M abel
G aye— she w as tight. Bound
she’d kiss m e good night. W anted
m e to stay— ”
M iss Moss sm iled at the austerity
behind his words. “ S h e'll be grateful
to you today,” she suggested.
T o p e said in a m irthful tone:
“ And you no sooner get rid o f her,
than another one com es out in her
nightgown to w a y la y you, Clint.
What is this strange power of
you rs?”
C lint laughed, and then the telephone
rang. Tope went briskly
across the room . H e said:
“ H ello ! . . . Y es , speaking . . .
Oh, yes. In sp ector.”
A silence, w hile he listened. Th en:
" Y e s , thanks."
A nother silence; and then Tope
sa id:
"W h y , I 'l l com e out and see you,
and bring him along. S u re."
H e put up the re c e iv e r and turned
back to them ; and M iss Moss saw
that his eyes shone.
"W h a t is it ? " Clint demanded.
“ Inspector H ea le tells m e he
called up the M ed ical E x am in er,”
T ope explained. “ D octor D errie
had had no report on the death, >o
H ea le ca lled the fa m ily doctor. Doctor
nam ed C abler. H e says Mrs.
L ea fo rd died fro m an overdose ot
som e sleeping-pow der.” H e added,
a fter a m om ent: "A c cid e n ta L ”
“ A ccid en ta l? ” M iss Moss repeated,
in a flat tone.
T h ere w as a m om ent’s silence,
and then he added:
"In s p e c to r H eale wants to know
how I knew about it. And he wants
to talk to you, Clint. I think you'd
better d riv e us out th ere.”
C H A PTER V
Clint swung the ca r o ff the main
thoroughfare. "T h is is the road,”
he said. “ I 'l l show you .”
And he drove m ore slowly, studying
the w ay. Woodlands shut them
in on eith er side before he stopped
at last, w here there was a path, and
a house am ong the trees.
“ This is where I let her out,”
he explained.
Tope nodded, looking toward the
house. "P r o b a b ly Doctor C abler
lives th ere,” he suggested. "H o w
fa r had she ridden with you?”
" I w as com in g down this h ill,”
Clint explained, and he drove on,
said presen tly: " I t must h »v e been
along here som ew here that I o v ertook
her.”
Tope com m ented: “ N o houses
anyw here near.”
“ T h e y 'r e on top o f the h ill," Clint
replied. H e put the ca r sw iftly up
the grad e and the three houses
cam e into view .
Tope said, in a low tone as though
he m ight be o verh ea rd : “ D rive
slow ly, C lint.”
“ I 'l l stop,” C lint amended. H e
pulled up the ca r beside the road,
and got out, under pretext o f inspecting
the tires; but at the sam e
lim e, under the brim o f his hat, he
looked attentively at these three
houses by the road. So did Tope and
M iss Moss too.
T h ere w as an undertaker's g a rland
attached to the door o f the
house in the m id d le; and a car
with a doctor's tag stood beside the
road. Th e day was w arm and fine
a fter the sh ow er; y et nowhere did
Clint see a window open. Som e of
the shutters w ere closed and at other
windows thick curtains hung.
Behind the houses, the woods w ere
dark and still.
When Clint presently drove on, he
looked at Tope to see w hat im pression
the old er m an had received.
"W e ll, there they a re ,” he said
“ What do you think?”
Tope answ ered w ith a slow s m ile :
“ W hy, I get notions. F ool notions,
m aybe, C lint; but I ’ ve got in the
habit o f believin g them. It feels to
me as if the people that lived in
those houses w ere a fra id .”
“ Th e g ir l was a fra id ," Clint
agreed. "B u t w hat would they ba
afraid o f? ”
“ W e ll," Tope reminded him, his
tone suddenly grim , " A wom an died
o f poison in there last night. I f
she'd known it was going to happen,
she'd h a ve had a right to be
a fra id .”
So Clint w as silenced; and they
cam e on into the suburban town that
was their destination, and found P olice
H eadquarters. Miss Moss elected
to stay in the ca r while they went
inside.
Inspector H eale cam e to m eet
them. H e w as lean and gray, and
his brow s w ere extravagantly
bushy. H e shook Tope's hand, and
spoke som e hearty word.
“ M igh t have known you’d be
around,” he said humorously. “ You
old buzzard! H ow do you hear about
these things so soon? I didn't even
know Mrs. L ea fo rd w as dead till
you ca lled m e up.”
"D o n e a n yth in g?" Tope asked seriously.
Inspector H eale bade them com e
into his o ffice and closed the door,
and he shook hia head. " N o ,” he
confessed. “ D octor D errie's gone
to look her over, o f course. Doctor
C abler hadn’t notified him. C abler
w as called In late last night, slept
late this m orning. Th at's w hy he
hadn’t phoned Doc D errie. Ha said
there w asn’t any hurry.”
And he explained: “ Mrs. Lea ford
had been taking this dope for years.
She took an overdose once before,
and cam e n ear passing out. Thia
tim e it was nearer than that.”
"D e a d when Doctor C abler got
th ere?” T o p e inquired.
“ B efore that, I guess,” H eale e x plained;
and he looked at Tope and
then at C lint inquiringly. "B u t I
want to know how you heard about
it ," he rem inded them, and Tope
bade Clint tell the tale o f hia adventure
the night before.
So Clint repeated his story; and
Inspector H ea le listened without interruption
till he was done.
“ Th e g irl w as Miss L e a fo rd ," he
explained then, “ Mrs. Lea ford 's
daughter. She found her mother
dead, and the tetephone w as out of
order on account o f the shower, so
she ran to get the d o cto r." H e
grinned. " I didn’t know she m ade
the triy in her n igh tie,” he adm
itted. “ T h ey 're a queer lot up
there, and she’s as queer as the
rest o f them .”
" T h e y ’re that w ay about ev ery thing,”
Inspector H eale insisted.
" Y o u take electric lights. Hurder
put them in his house, here a few
yea rs back ; and then the others
hooked his m eter, to sa ve m eter deposits.
Th e light com pany kicked,
but those folks on the H ill, they
m ostly get their own w ay when they
want it. Old Mrs. Bowdon—she's
seventy if she's a d a y— you can
argue with her till yo u 're blind and
she don't g iv e an inch.
"A n d Mrs. Taine's as bad,” H ea lt
continued. "S h e's one o f these
thin, stringy women in a black
d ress; and she talks in a kind of
w hisper as if butter wouldn't m elt in
her mouth. She can strip the hide off
you and n ever raise her voice. She's
a w orker, too. She’ ll put on overalls
and go right at it. Do anything.
F or instance, she w ired her

hooked up the w ires in Hurder's
cellar. I f I didn't know they had

a cent, the w ay she w orks all the

Clint began : "M iss L ea fo rd —”
T h e Inspector said guardedly:
"W h y . she m ight be all right, for

L o c a lly known as "g ra s s w o rm s ,"
they m ake their habitat in lofty
mountain ranges o f the Tibetan
border, near the Tatsienlu leper
hom e conducted by the F ria rs M inor
of the Hankow V icariate.
N atives eat them dead or alive for
m edical purposes. In either form
they bring fancy prices. Th ey are
in grea t dem and fo r the m entally
depressed and for su fferers o f stom ach
trouble.
When dead they a re m ixed with
boiled chicken. In this concoction
they are said to rea ct w onderfully
as ''pick-m e-ups.” When live w orm s
without cocoons a re dug up they are
m ixed with a strong liquor, distilled
from m aize. Taken in this form
they a re considered a potent rem edy
against stom ach ills.
So valu able is the "g ra s s -w o rm "
considered that hundreds of hunters
m ake a livin g by gatherin g them.
T h t hunters sw arm the mountain
slopes to search fo r these w orm s.
T h ey easily find ea g e r buyers, anxious
to purchase all they can dig up.
In the w inter season, the ground
is covered with these insects. M ort
often they are found in the cocoon,
less often without. In either form
they find a ready m arket.
Though somewhat sm aller, they
resem ble silk-worm s in appearance.
Th e head is covcred by a brightred
crust. A s w inter approaches
they burrow head-first straight down
into the ground. H ere they spin
thin cocoons in which they w rap
them selves. When the snow melts,
their heads begin a sprouting process.
Thin hairs, resem bling grass,
spring from the soil.
Th e people o f the district believe
that the sprouting blades open like
flowers and scatter spores which in
due tim e develop into other worms.

Lucky is the hom em aker who has
tucked away on her pantry shelf a
package or two o f oatm eal, and in
her recipe file a half-dozen cle ve r
suggestions fo r using it in her
menus. F or oatm eal is a quick
change artist, and with a little ingenuity
you can turn out a whole
a rra y of tem pting, unusual dishes as
delicious to eat as they are inexpensive
to eat.
F o r exam ple, have you ev e r tried
m aking light, flavorsom e raisin m uffins
w i t h oatm
eal? O r h a v e
you used oatm eal
in a thick, hearty
vegetab le s o u p
to g ive it that
"s tic k - to - ther
ib s " quality so
much to be desired
for a ctive
fam ilies? Had you
thought of using
it to stretch the
m eat budget, by
m aking a little m eat go a long w ay
in m eat patties or m eat loaf? Y ou 've
used oatm eal fo r luscious, soft,
chew y cookies, o f course, but have
you tried it fo r m aking the crust for
a delectable apple pudding, or have
you substituted it for nut m eats in a
rich-tasting torte?
You see. besides adding interest
and va riety to m eals, and doing a
first-class job o f budget stretching,
oatm eal m ay be trusted to add a
la rg e amount o f low-cost food energy
to the diet. Oatm eal, m oreover,
is an excellent source o f vitam in B,
m odernly called thiamin. This vita min
is absolutely necessary to enable
the body to transform food (especially
carbohydrates) into muscular
energy. Thiam in stim ulates the
appetite, too, and it helps in o vercom
in g constipation, and acts as a
prevention of nervousness.

Sunday is Father’s Day and to
Fathers we dedicate these lines by
Edgar Guest:
“ T H E M A N T O BE”
Some day the world will need a man
o f courage in a time o f doubt,
And somewhere, as a little boy, that
future hero plays about.
Within some humble home, no doubt,
that instrument of greater things
Now climbs upon his father’s knee or
to his mother’s garment clings,
And when shall come that call for him
to render service that is fine,
He that shall do God’s mission here
may be your little boy or mine.
Long years o f preparation mark the
pathway for the splendid souls,
And generations live and die and seem
no nearer to their goals.
And yet the purpose o f it all, the fleet
ing pleasure and the woe,
The laughter and the g r ie f of life that
all who come to earth must know
May be to pave the way for one— one
man to servc^the W I L L D IV IN E
And is it possible that he may be your
little boy or mine.
Some day the world will need a man!
I stand beside his cot at night
And wonder if I ’m teaching him, as
best I can, to know the right.
I am the father o f a boy— his life is
mine to make or mar—
And he no better can become than
what my daily teachings are;
There will be need for someone great
— I dare not fa lter from the line—
The man that is to serve the world
may be that little boy o f mine.
Perhaps your boy and mine may not
ascend the lofty heights o f fame;
The orders for their births are hid; we
know not why to earth they came.
Yret in some little bed tonight the
great man o f tomorrow sleeps.
And only He who sent him here the
secret o f his purpose keeps.
As fathers then our care is this— to
keep in mind the Great Design.
The Man the World shall need some
day may be your little boy or mine.
Old Plates W ere Same Color,
Hut Figures Oid Not M e
It waa Rinehart! Jesse, Shawano carpenter,
who discovered that li#i5 auto
license plates were the same color as
the current ones. The discovery in itself
would have meant little, but Mr.
Jesse, being a th rifty man, conceived
the idea of boring a small hole just
above the 5 in 1935 and running a
small reflector through it, thus covering
the open part o f the figure. A t a
casual glance the plates stood inspection,
but when Officer Stanley Brown
looked them over, the carpenter was
immediately charged with operating
an unregistered vehicle and using license
plates on a car fo r which they
were not registered.
Shawano county officers will keep
a sharp lookout hereafter fo r such
licenses, since there is a sure-fire way
o f telling them from current plates.
Jesse paid a fine o f $35 and costs
o f $5.75, and was ordered to pay, in
addition, $14 for a 1939 license.— The
Shawano Journal.

“ Triple-Barreled Thrill”
He l l o , e v e r y b o d y :
This column has passed out a lot ot fre e advice at one
tim e or another. It seems that everybod y who ever has an adventure,
learns something from it that he wants to pass along
to the rest of the world, and this seems to be the clearin g house
fo r that kind o f inform ation. I ’ v e issued warnings about e v ery thing
from jum ping off 40-story buildings to getting frien dly with
the mother-in-law o f a m an-eating tiger. Today I ’ ve got another
warning for you. I don’ t know if you’ ll ever have occasion to
use it, but I ’ ll pass it along fo r what it's worth. I f you’ re ever
m otoring to N iaga ra F a lls at night, don’ t go by the R iv e r road.
That com es from Jim M cD erm ott of N ew Y o rk City.
Some of you fellow s who have been to that address before m ay
recogn ize it as the M en’ s N igh t Court. W ell, that’ s w here
you’ ll find Jim . H e’ s the fingerprint expert there. But in
1926, Jim was a m em ber of the Im m igration B order P atrol,
stationed at Tonawanda, N. Y ., half w a y between N ia g a ra F a ll* and
Buffalo. T h a t’s how he found out about R iv e r road.
R iv er road w as dangerous because of the w ay cars sped along it at
night. But speeding cars w eren 't the only danger, folks said. I t was
the duty o f Jim and another lad— Roscoe Doane—to patrol that road in a
ca r. T h eir duty w as to preven t the sm uggling of aliens and of contraband
goods, the principal contraband in that pre-repeal day being liquor.
“ B efore I took the job ,” says Jim , "p eo p le advised m e against it.
T h ey claim ed the bootleggers w ere desperate and would shoot on sight.
I found this to be untrue. But I did fa ce death in three violent form s,
in about as m any minutes on one particular night of m y service .”
Th ey Started Out in a Sm all Roadster.
T h at night cam e in the spring of 1926. Jim and Roscoe started
out in a sm all roadster, with the top down. Roscoe was d rivin g,
for Jim , at that tim e didn’t know how to operate a ca r. F ix 's F e r r y

and then started to d riv e tow ard Tonawanda.

T h eir ea r seem ed to soar in the road fo r • m om ent or tw o.
com ing straight down the center o f the road and it w as com ing plenty
fast. Jim yelled to R oscoe, " G iv e this fellow all the room you can, or
h e’ ll hit us.” Roscoe was alread y turning o ver on the grass at the side
o f the road. But the headlights cam e rushing on.
Then— B A N G ! Th e ca r hit th em ! Says Jim : "O u r car seem ed
to soar in the a ir fo r a m om ent or two. A s w e w ere hit, Roscoe
jum ped to get out, and landed in m y lap. Th e left front w heel of
the big sedan had caught our front wheel. It lifted our light car
com pletely off the road and swung it around. A t the sam e tim e.
It turned o v er and landed bottom up, diagonally across the narrow
roadw ay.”
Jim says that, during the b rie f m om ent w hile they w ere turning
over, just one question presented itself to his mind. Th at w as: " W ill I
be dead when w e h it?” But down there, trapped under the overturned
ca r, Jim found to his surprise that he w asn't dead.
The W eight of the C ar Seemed to Increase M om entarily.
"R o s c o e was on top of m e,” he says, "w ith his back on m y
fa ce, and he was doing some struggling. I couldn't m ove. M y
shoulders and the back of m y neck w ere on the road, and I w as
still on the seat, albeit upside down. M y back ached and tha
w eight o f the car, crushing down on m e, w as increasing m om
en ta rily.”
H e w as in that position when suddenly he heard Roscoe let out an
oath. " H e r e ’ s a guy doing 50 and no lights,” he cried. " H e 'll hit us
sure as hell.” Jim couldn't see a thing, but it was true, he knew. Th eir
c a r was lying right across the toad. A man going at that speed, with no
lights, could hardly help but hit them.
Says J im : " F o r the second tim e, I thought the end had com e.
I could see only a fe w feet ahead through the w reck age, but I
could hear the roar of the approaching car. I gritted m y teeth
and struggled to get out, but 1 couldn't m ove. Roscoe was m aking
m y position m ore uncom fortable every second. I shouted out,

Tw o narrow escapes. And a third still to come. A s the night g rew
quiet again, Jim discovered that their headlights w ere still burning and
the m otor was still running.
Suddenly H e F e lt Something Drip Down on His F ace.
And then, suddenly, he fe lt something drip down on his fa ce.
‘ ‘M y first thought was that It was blood,” he says, "b u t that
couldn't be. This fluid was cold. I struggled to g et m y hand to
m y fa ce, but before I got it there, I knew it w as gasoline. It
w as com ing from the tank just outside the dashboard, o ver the
engine. I had faced death tw ice before— and now I w as facin g
it again in a m ore dreadful form . Our engine w as still running.
A t any m om ent the car m ight burst into fla m es !”
I t didn’t occur to Jim to shut off the switch. H e didn’t know how to
d riv e a car. M om entarily he expected an explosion— fire—agony and
death. And then, all at once, he heard voices. Someone w as saying,
“ A ll on this side, now.” T h e car w as lifted off them, and half a dozen
m en w ere pulling him out. A bunch of arm y officers, returning from
Buffalo to F o rt N iaga ra, had com e along and found them.
Th e ca r that hit them had run through a ditch and crashed
into a tree. It contained a suitcase full of counterfeit liquor labels,
hut the d riv er was gone. He had w alked down the road and telephoned
ahead fo r help. Th e second car had just m anaged to g et
by them because a fa rm e r's w ife, who had seen the crash, ran
to the road with a lantern. That second car got by with barely
two Inches to spare. Rut It didn't stop. Cars without lights
along that road n ever did.
Jim was laid up three w eeks w ith a wrenched back, but Roscoe
Doane got off with a fe w bruises. But even so, Jim doesn’ t think it'a
particularly safe at night on that R iv e r road.

Saved by Chance
T h o m a s p a i n e , with h u stir-

in Washington's a rm y , did much to

servin g as aide to Gen. Nathanael
G reene, he becam e secreta ry to the
congressional com m ittee o f foreign
a ffa irs and helped get loans from
F ra n c e and Holland.
But aiding the fight fo r human
lib erty o f only one pecple w as not
enough for him. Instead o f settling
down to enjoy lift in the nation he
helped found, he went to England
and, in 1791. published his fam ous
" R ig h ts of M an” for which he was
outlawed by the king’s court. Then
he went to F ran ce w here he was
elected to the national convention.
But when he opposed the execution
o f K in g Louis X V I, the Jacobins
expelled him from the convention.
When Robespierre cam e into power,
P a in e was thrown into prison and
condemned to the guillotine. He '

Captive for 10 Years
I N 1800, E llis P. Bean left his home
* in Tennessee and drifted down
the M ississippi to Natchez w here he
took a job with a pack train. B ecause
they ca rried contraband, the
party w as attacked by Spanish soldiers.
Bean, with a few other survivors.
was taken to prison in Chihuahua.
Then follow ed one of the cruelest
periods of im prisonm ent that any
m an has ev e r endured and rem
ained sane. F or three yea rs he
la y in prison at Chihuahua and then
escaped only to be recaptured,
beaten alm ost to death and chained
to the prison w all. A fte r tryin g to
escape again, he w as thrown into a
dungeon at Acapulco. E ventu ally
allow ed to w ork in chains during
the daytim e, he killed his two
guards with a crow bar and got
aw ay.
A ga in caught, he put in another
y ea r in dark, dirty dungeons and
w as flogged regu larly. A gain allow
ed to work, he killed seven men
and this tim e got 300 m iles away
b e fore he was seized. In reta lia tion,
he was m ade the vic tim of
alm ost e v e r y kind o f cru elty.
So w#ll w as he able to stand 10
yea rs of this treatm ent, unbroken in
sp irit and with defiance gleam in g in
his still bright eyes, that hi* captors
developed a superstitious fe a r of
him. When the revolution broke out,
they offered him a place in the
loya list arm y which he accepted
rea d ily but with his fingers crossed.
Once at liberty, he soon talked
his companions into going o v e r to
the other side and was g iven a captaincy.
F in ally he led a vic to rio u i
fo rc e into A capulco and those who
had been so cruel to him begged
fo r m ercy. In true A m erican fashion,
he showed no bitterness— no desire
for revenge. " G o a w ay and
don’t bother m e,” w ere the only
w ords he had fo r those who had
g iven him 10 y ea rs of torture.

‘Dictator’ of Skagway
U IS nam e w as Jefferson Ran-
* * dolph Smith and he w as born
in G eo rgia in I860, all o f which
sounds like wonderful background
fo r the story o f a Southern gentleman.
But he w as a g am b ler and
a crook who wound up in A laska—
and they called him "S o a p y ” Smith.
H e got his nam e in L ea d v ille,
Colo., w here he sold suckers bars
o f soap supposedly w rapped ln $20
bills. He w as a gam b ler and confidence
man in D en ver and Creede,
Colo., w here he becam e "d ic ta to r ”
o f the cam p, succeeding Bob Ford,
sla y er of Jesse Jam es.
When the Alaskan gold rush began,
he went up to Sk agw ay and
found the town w ide open and w aiting
fo r a m an of his talents. He
soon becam e leader o f a gang that
used his saloon as headquarters for
fraud, robbery and even m urder.
H is disrespect fo r law w as so flagrant
that it soon becam e too much
tven for that law less com m unity. A
citizens’ com m ittee held a closed
m eeting to decide w hat to do about
it. N o decision was re a lly necessary,
as " S o a p y " tried to "c r a s h ”
the m eeting with a W inchester rifle
but w as fa ta lly shot by an arm ed
guard.
A s a rem inder of the daring days
of the Klondike, the town o f Skagw

sign today than a huge rock carved
in the form of a skull and bearing
only one nam e— "S o a p y ” Sm ith—
