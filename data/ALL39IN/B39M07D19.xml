         <p>THE CENTENNIAL PAGEANT
The centennial pageant depicting
scenes in the early history of the 
Black River valley was given Sun
day Monday and Tuesday evening;
on a stage erected before the grand
stand at the fair grounds and was
witnessed by thousands all of whon
enjoyed it and many of whom saw i
all three nights of the pageant 
Two or three years ago A P Jonei
had worked out a water pageant wit 
the possibility that it might be giver
here on an occasion of this sort His
suggestions were used in the pageant
presented at the fair grounds although
changes were made to fit the case
Miss Elsa Mork member of the high
school faculty was engaged to reniair
at the close of school and coach the  
pageant She chose the scenes fron
a combination of sources Mr Jones
pageant suggestions from Ben Hunt
ley Captain Johnson s old history
and Miss La Von Jones thesis which
was a history of Jackson country An
old history the property of the late
Judge G M Perry was the basis of
the commentator s broadcast during
the scenes Clarence Hoke officiated
as commentator 
The scents shown during the pageant
consisted of a striking scene ol
Indians in native costume the arrival
of the early settlers the erection oi
the saw mill and later burning it Jacob
Spaulding s run-in with the Indians
and routing them The one hilarious
scene in the entertainment was
the one of the old Shanghai House 
early day entertainment emporium in
Black River Falls While it met with
criticism on the part of some who did
not think it seemly it was probably
even milder than the real thing for
those were rough days One of the
high-lights was a duet sang by Mrs 
M H Moen and Rufus Dimmick during
the Indian scene both dressed in
beautiful Indian costumes The old
fashioned quartet and the Sweet
Adeline quartet were also received
with acclaim 
The crowding of the queens and
the style show which were given in
last weeks issue was another highlight
of the evening and were followed
by the pageant tableau which
was a fitting climax to an evening s
entertainment The melting pot
which goes to make up any American
community was symbolized by the
group of girls representing the various
countries Dressed in native custumes
they were very attractive as
they danced on the stage

OLD THINGS IN
WINDOW DISPLAYS
There were many who studied the
window displays during the centennial 
many who admired them many
who wondered where in the world all
the things had been unearthed 
Just to give one an idea of the
display it wrould be of interest to
see the booklet David A Blencoe 
president of the Jackson County Historical
Society made He listed every
exhibit in every window He will undoubtedly
keep it among his historical
collection and some day it will
be history too We regret that space
makes printing his list an impossibility
although listing the articles would
not convey to the reader the actual
interest of the exhibits 
Seventeen business houses had displays
with 740 articles displayed in
all The least in a window were 11
articles and the most 110 articles 
which were in Locken s window 
Among the places with window displays
w ere Henry E Berg Schultz
Bros Kasik s cafe (which contained 
the Telephone Company s exhibit) 
Werner s Samdahl s Drug store P L 
Moe s Hardware store Chaimson s ;
Department store Moe s Clothing
Store Hagen Son Clothing Store ;
Taylor Jones dry goods store the
Model Store Biggar s Store Keefe 
 Ness Furniture store Frederikson s   
Food Store Lloyd s Cafe Locken s 
Shoe Store and the Banner-Journal 
Although every window was inter- ;
esting and all attracted attention a 1
great deal of interest centered on 
Frederikson s Keefe Ness and
Biggar s three adjoining stores be- i
tween Second and First streets on ]
Main street Mr Frederikson carved i
oxen from tallow with galvanized 1
tin tools which he made himself and ]
showed a logging scene that was very ;
realistic as was his Paul Bunyan and j
his ox Babe The background was 1
sketched by his daughter Miss Mar- ;
garet and the life size head of a
lumberjack he carved from a block of
rock salt with the claw end of a
hammer It was a striking scene 
Keefe Ness had a modem bed room 
in one display window and an unmodern
one in the other The latter
was complete to the last detail without
which no unmodern home was a
finished product Biggar s windows -
were both dressed for the occasion in (
old time clothes and there wTere some j
perfectly beautiful costumes which
wrere admired by hundreds of interest- 1
ed spectators every day they were on i
display There were 67 articles in all
on display and every one of interest 1
Taylor Jones also had a very inter- 
esting window display with 57 articles
of old time interest placarded and :
read by all who stopped to admire it 
Moe s hardware store had 76 old i
time tools on display; the Banner-   
Journal mostly old time newspapers 
and m agazines; Henry Berg old time 
jewelry and articles of interest 60 in
all Hagen s and Moe s clothing
stores displayed many articles of
wearing apparel as well as other
articles of interest As stated before 
there wrasn t a window overlooked by 1
the interested onlookers and all appreciated
the work of those who col- 1
lected the material loaned the mater- ]
ials and arranged the windows 
THEODORE DRAKE
Mrs Simon Olson received a tele- 
gram Monday July 17 1939 stating

body here and funeral services will be ]
held at 2 p m Thursday at the Mattson

cently that have been built in the city j
since 1935 the home of Mr and Mrs j
Sig Hanson on Harrison street in the 
First ward was omitted and the house 
credited to Ed O Brien should have

to the court house school house a J
new postoffice and an addition to the 1

The latest developments in the local
soil erosion control program include
ten farms which have recently been
added to the list of those included in
cooperative erosion control agreements
between individual farmers and
the Soil Conservation Service at
Camp Irving according to R E 
W olff superintendent 
The farms totaling 1126 acres are
those of Eddie Peterson Harry A 
Slosser George Slosser Theodore
Bunde Reuben Holmgreen Fred Balsiger 
Charles Finch Claude Wenzel
operated by Irvin Hemker Anton Anderson
(Est ) operated by Palmer
Midtlien and Bangor Milling Co 
operated by Hugh E Hemstock 
 A complete erosion control program 
including every acre of the
farm is being developed on each
farm and all conservation measures
that are adapted to the individual
farm are included W olff said 
 A total of 70 acres on the 10
farms will be seeded to alfalfa and
timothy which is a soil conserving
crop that the Service recommends for
protective cover on steep rough cropland 
 the superintendent declared in
outlining the advantages of close
cover crops on this type of land 
 Contour strip cropping   by which
long slopes are broken up by alternate
strips of close growing cover
crops and small grain or corn will
be established on 402 acres on the
ten farms he continued 
 Plans also include approximately
85 acres of pastured woods which
will be protected against grazing and
fire as a part of the control work 
Grazing of woods reduces their effectiveness
in controlling runoff and
erosion W olff emphasized Grazing
animals trample the leaf litter 
pack the ground and destroy undergrowth 
Protected woods provide almost
complete protection against soil
washing on steep slopes and prevent
piling up of runoff and debris on
croplands below 
Forty acres of land unsuited to cultivation
are being planted to trees on
the farms Additional supplementary
control measures include construction
o f two concrete head flumes one
bleeder dike 150 sod humps 14 sod
flumes 10 400 sq yds bank sloping 
and 6 495 lineal feet diversion dikes
to assist in the control of gullies 
 792 tons of lime will be applied
to aid in establishing legumes on
slopes too steep for cultivation and on
strips in long rotations Protection
of woods aganst grazing and realignment
o f woods and fields a considerable
proportion of which is to be
built on the contour will call for
2 634 rods of fence construction the
superintendent explained 
 To date 95 farmers have entered
into cooperative agreements with
the Soil Conservation Service in the
Camp Irving area he concluded

The blueberry crop in this section
just isn t anything to speak of this
year What the frost didn t get the
dry weather did and except for occasional
swamp patches very few are
to be found They have been paying
 3 00 per case locally with few if any
takers 
Many of the Winnebago Indians
from this section have gone north this
year and are camping in the northwest
corner of the Chequamegon national
forest reserve while they pick
berries there being one section in
northern Wisconsin where they have
the best crop they have had in years
according to word sent back by Indian
pickers Their best picking is
north of Iron Mountain 
Whether they have much picking
or not they have a fine camping
ground in the Chequamegon Nice
springs fireplaces and many conveniences
besides the nice cool weather
they have enjoyed in that section 
Northern blueberries have been selling
in this section too but there is
not enough crop to bring the price
down to the level that will let some
o f our best blueberry pie eaters into
the running

WHITEHALL WINS IN
TENTH 3 TO 2
So many people have asked for an
explanation of how com e   that
Whitehall could come close enough to
the Merchants to nose out a victory
over the Black River Falls heroes It
was like this : Little David made a
piker out of Goliath because the latter
zigged when he should have lagged 
but if the giant had zagggd
when he should have zagged what a
sucker the boy with the sling shot
would have been In other words 
the smaller combatant got all tlhe
breaks and you can t beat breaks 
Look at what almost happened to
Louis when Galento started a punch
from the back forty of course in
that case it didn t happen but it
wasn t far away from it And didn t
the Kankees just recently drop six
straight   So we say so what   you
can t win em all It had to happen
some time and Whitehall was lucky
enough to catch th   Merchants when
they were zigging at Whitehall last
Thursday afternoon 
The first break of the game came
in the opening frame when with Bob
 the Turtle Teeples waiting in the
baselines Art nailed one on the nose 
The pill sailed directly into a gale
blowing from the west enabling the
right gardener to pull it in If that
zither had not come along the Merchants
would have had two runs then
and there Alert base running would
have counted another run and possibly
two in the 6th Then in Whitehall s
half of the 5th an ordinary
single by Garaghan took a freakish
bound and got away from Kleven for
a triple which later became a tally on
a squeeze play But we are not alibi-
ing   the Merchants don t need any
alibi for their work on the ball diamond 
The first run of the ball game was
registered by Whitehall in the 5th 
when as mentioned Garaghan got his
soiled triple W Wright bunted and
Garaghan dashed across the dish 
The Merchants lost no time getting
a lead coming right back in the top
o f the 6th with a pair of runs Randles
drew a walk and was pushed
along a base on Kleven s sacrifice 
Teeples smashed a drive to Fremstad
who done a W C Fields with it until
Randles had gone to 3rd and Teeples
had spiked first Fremstad threw
Randles at the platter from short on
A Rudolph s ground ball Teeples
scored as Erickson was trying to get
his hands on a slow bouncing ball off
the bat of Ellison Art of the Rudolph
family going to 3rd Art raced over
home on a sizzling hit over 2nd off the
war club of Hoard Both Len and
Royce were left stranded Two more
Merchants were left marooned in the
7th when Randles and Kleven singled
in succession after two were defunct 
Hoard slammed out his second hit in
the 8th but he again was waiting
when the chapter ended 
With one embalmed in the 8th W 
Wright selected one of Ernie s slow
balls to convert it into a hit Warner
drove a double between Kleven and
Randles and the ball game was tied
up at two all 
The fracas ended in the 10th when
Getz got his signals crossed on the
difference between a ball and strike 
He could not seem to distinguish between
Garaghan s ankles and hipe so
the Irish swatsman walked on five or
six strikes Erickson bunted and all
hands were safe when Ernie s hurried
throw to first was slightly wide o f
Hauser Garaghan going to 3rd An
illegal play on which the throw to
the plate was blocked by W Wright
who had bunted on a squeeze and ran
to first inside and baselines allowed
Garaghan to score The umps overlooked
this little rule so all hands
went home and we went with the
Merchants to meditate over what a
louse Dame Fortune can sometimes
be It was the 13th game of the season 
played on the 13th day of the
month Maybe you can t slap Lady
Fortune in the teeth like that and get
by with it It seems that way 
Rudolph struck out 14 and allowed
only 4 hits Only 1 hit had been
punched off his offerings in seven
innings A ball team needs breaks to
win against that kind of pitching   so
we don t alibi simply explain

The Black River Falls baseball team
celebrated Ernie Rudolph night last
Sunday by presenting the famous little
pitcher with a 9 to 1 victory over
the fast traveling Blair aggregation 
Before the ball game got under
way Father Peters representing the
people of Black River Falls presented
Ernie with a tailor-made bowling ball
and get this folks   a check for a hundred
cocoanuts A nice gesture and
in keeping with the true appreciation
o f the ball fans who have received
countless thrills by the little guy s
phenomenal work both on the hill and
at bat in the many games Rude has
played in this section of Wisconsin 
Father Peters also pointed out that
Ernie has been doing a top notch job
o f managing the locals and in getting
together the fine ball team that he
has assembled Father not only called
attention to the fine battery work
but to the outfield and especially focused
attention on the speed of the infield 
In the latter department only
one criticism was made No names
were mentioned but Father Peters
suggested that if the shortstop position
were covered with greater rapidity
 W e could not help but
think that if it were covered with
greater speed what use would the
Merchants have for the rest of the
infield or for the outfield 
Maybe Bob took a hint It looked
that way on the first play of the ball
game when the little rascal ran far
into left field to his right speared
a sizzling ground ball and got his
man on a long lightning fast peg to
Hauser The play had more glamour
than all the floozies in Hollywood 
Later in the ball game Kleven
turned in a play that fairly sparkled
with a beautiful long running catch
o f Ellison s line drive Not to be outdone
Hoard performed a hair-raising
acrobatic catch of a high foul that
came down out of the darkness Plays
like these are what speak so well for
Ernie s judgment as the Mapordomo
o f the Merchants ball club 
Shaw who was on the hill (Rude
having hurled a 33 to 0 victory for
Blair over Arcadia in the afternoon)
turned in a swell 3-hit job for the 7
innings he worked on the turret The
lanky hurler struck out 11 and allowed
not an earned run His performance
gave notice that he will be o f
plenty use to Black River during the
rest of the season 
The locals brewed up a batch of
4 runs in the opening round on 5 hits
authored by Kleven A Rudolph E 
Rudolph a double by Hoard and a
hit by Hauser 
Blair scored in the second on a pass
to Peewee Sjugerud a wild pitch
and a single by Anderson 
Three hits by A and E Rudolph
and Hauser the latter being a 2-baser 
went to waste in the 3rd and it
was not until the 7th that more business
was transacted by the Merchants 
Randles and Kleven singled
after one was away T eeples rammed
a double into right moping up the
bags but was sunk trying to stretch
the blow into a triple 
Production was completed in the
last half of the 8th with a trio o f
tallies Ernest Queen Mary Rudolph
started it with a line hit between
1st and 2d Hoard followed
suit with a beauty of a hit into center 
A bobble at 3rd scored Ernie
and put Hoard on 3rd and Hauser on
2d from whence they went home on
Neilfeldt s hit in left 
Just as a gesture the fireball o f
Black River took the job on the
knob for the last two chukkers A
great plea for a strikeout went up
when he faced Ellison Here was the
big disappointment of the evening;
Len singled to ruin an otherwise perfect
evening

Andrew Davis was born October 8 
184o in Parkersburg West Virginia

When about 10 years of age he came
with his parents to La Crosse The
next year 1856 they moved to Roaring
Ureek and settled on a farm
where they lived for nine years They
then moved to Irving He received
his education in the public schools 
When a young man about 20 years
o f age he went to Sparta and purchased
a peep show the forerunner
o i our modern movie with which he
toured the eastern states charging a
dime a peep It was after this adventure
that he returned to irving then
known as Davis ferry and started his
business as a pedler 
Later in life when he ceased to
travel the country he kept a little
general store at Irving and was in
charge of the post office there for a
number of years 
He leaves two sisters Mrs Ella
Jay of Mauston and Mrs Meda
Smock of Twin Falls Idaho and one
brother Alonzo Davis of Irving Another
sister Mrs Ciorinda Hooker 
recently passed away He leaves
many other relatives and friends to
mourn his death 
Andrew Davis    kindly gentle 
courteous He was among the early
recollections o i many in the territory
he covered with his peddler s wagon 
The big green covered wagon with
the big horse clomping along over the
country roads it was an event when
he came to a home and stopped to
show his wares He tied his big horse
by dropping a weight in front of it
and snapping the big rope attached
to it to the bridle Then he opened
the back door of his wagon which
was loaded with traps and one by
one the trays came out and the people
of the community gladly supplied
their household needs from his store 
He was extremely honest If there
were a defect in any oi his goods he
was the one to point it out He suffered
oi a nervous affliction affecting
his hands as the result of burns received
when he was young and often
it was difficult for him to control his
hands but no one was ever known to
think his affliction was funny He
was liked by all and the home in
which he stopped for meals or over
night considered him an honored
guest and enjoyed his store of news 
always told in a kindly way and with
malice toward none Andrew Davis 
His kind is rare in this day and age
and his place has been taken by the
good roads the automobile and the
mail order houses The young people
o f the present day will have no
substitute for his memory

Wednesday July 5th marked another
wedding anniversary for our
much loved neighbors Mr and Mrs 
Frank Creviston the 65th Sixty-five
years of happy wedded life getting
some of the hard knocks of course 
but on the whole it has been smooth
sailing and a mighty pleasant voyage 
Mr and Mrs Creviston were
married at Springville on July 5th 
1874 and farming was their occupation
until a few years ago Since
then their home has been in the village 
Mr Creviston and wife are
quite well for old people looking toward
the 90th milestone and Mr 
Creviston credits their long life to
temperate and honest living 
This notable anniversary which a
very small number of wedded couples
are privileged to reach and celebrate
with their friends was quietly observed 
owing to the hot spell which
the weatherman portioned out to us 
Mr Creviston says if his recollection
is correct it was too hot a day for
boiled shirts and party dresses when
the wedding was celebrated 65 years
ago but there was no weatherman to
blame it onto then A few of the
members of the Ladies Aid dropped
in to spend the afternoon with them
and extend congratulations in which
all their friends join May their coming
years be ones of continued good
health and free from the cares and
anxieties which beset so many in this

The alumni directory published
this year and covering all the classes
from the first in 1875 to 1939 is
receiving a warm welcome from some
o f the far-away graduates who have
received them 
Mrs Marion Hood (form erly Miss
Marion Smock) writes from Cascade 
Montana that she is delighted
with the directory stating that she
had lost track of so many of the old
friends and it gave so much pleasure
to see where they live at least She
thought it one of the finest things
the alumni has ever put over She
also said she had several old time
 Breezes and when Sadie Lind Hagen
or Manfred Messelt came over
they sometimes talked over old times 
Dr Everett D Ivey writes from
Oakland California that he appreciated
getting the directory and that
it is fine and interesting 
Lyman M Sinclair with the Hartford
Insurance Company and stationed
in Chicago 3148 West 63rd Street 
wrote a note of thanks for his directory 
and hoped that the homecoming
would be a big success 
Mrs A C Teeter wrote from
Swan River Minnesota warmly welcoming
her directory and stating
that like Queen Elizabeth on her recent
visit when asked about something
she thought it just swell She
told E E Homstad she thought they
did a wonderful thing when they compiled
and completed the directory She
appreciated the time the members o f
the committee had put on it She
would like a lot to attend the homecoming
for in her opinion  
 There are no friends like the old
friends 
You may travel east or west;
O f all the friends that you have made
You will find the old ones best

The biennium fiscal term of the
previous administration ended July 1
o f this year with a balance of about
 4 000 000 00 in the State Treasury 
but so far this Legislature has failed
to enact a new tax bill The proposed
several tax bills met with serious
objection from the public and
the Finance committee is again revising
the bill particularly that portion
pertaining to diversion of gasoline
funds It is quite essential that they
pass a tax bill soon as some of the
provisions of the previous tax bill become
inoperative on July 1 1939 At
present the records show that the tax
bill will be up for consideration in
the Assembly July 13 I hope that we
can finally agree on a plan 
A few days ago we had before us
one of the several bills which were
designed to wreck the cooperative
laws of the state of Wisconsin Bill
No 737 A prohibiting the teaching
o f the principles of cooperatives as I
had anticipated was defeated by a
very large vote; I still feel that we
will be able to defeat all pending
bills of this nature 
The Legislature still have before it
several bills which would abolish some
o f the commissions that have been in
operation for many years One of
these creating a new Highway Department
Commission   was passed by
the Assembly but was refused immediate
action in the Senate The measure
abolishing the Farm Home and
Credit Administration was defeated
by a very small margin However 
if the Legislature refused to raise
funds for its operation it will automatically
die 
The bill that would wipe the Progressive
party off the ballot passed
the Assembly by a vote of 47 to 45 
but it was refused immediate action
in the Senate where it was sent to a
committee I still doubt very much
that the present administration will
pass his drastic act 
The Legislators are anxiously hoping
for sine die adjournment but until
a tax measure is passed and while
the Administration has several wrecking
bills which they hope to pass the
session must continue

F ly Sprays
So many inquiries have been made
by farmers as to the possibilities o f
mixing home made sprays that the
following information was obtained
from the College of Agriculture:
This news ha sbrown out of the
studies conducted recently by entomologists
at the University of Wisconsin 
It was found in trials conducted
over a period of years that
the old smelly concoctions formerly
used to repel flies were not as necessary
as once supposed and that instead 
almost odorless fly sprays were
much more effective 
The important thing about fly
sprays is to keep the cows free from
flies during milking Sprays found
to be most effective in killing and
repelling flies in the barn in the milk
house and in the kitchen as well as
the rest of the home were the light
oil sprays which contained plenty o f
good contact insecticide These were
not only quicker but were also safer
to use on the cows since they evaporate
quickly A good light-oil spray
may be used by mixing one part o f
some good contact insecticide such as
pyrethrum of Lethane 384 in 19 parts
o f highly refined kerosene 
Heavy oil sprays which are made to
keep the cows free from flies in the
pasture may cause injury to the cow
if applied too heavily Furthermore 
it was found that these sprays should
not be used in the milk room or in
the home Heavy oils used carelessly
may not only do much more harm
to the cows than the flies will do but
trials show that there are seldom
enough flies on the cows in Wisconsin
to warrant the use of heavy oil
sprays 
When choosing sprays avoid the
highly scented sprays since these
might taint the milk or the milk products 
A spray which contains enough
good insecticide is very effective even
though nearly odorless 
Good sprayers were quite as necessary
as goo dsprays the test showed 
It was found that if the sprayer will
wet brown wrapping paper at a distance
o f two feet and do it quickly
and evenly it is well adjusted to the
spray 
1940 Soil C on servation P rogram
Soil conservation-will have increased
emphasis in the 1940 AAA farm
program says Harry Wells Chairman
o f the Wisconsin Agricultural Conservation
committee who attended the
National AAA conference in Washington 
D C last week Recommendations
for the 1940 farm program
were presented at this conference 
Next year s program it is pointed
out will also provide a better opportunity
for operators of small farms to
participate and the responsibility of
administration will continue in the
hands of farmer committees 
An important recommendation affecting
soil conservation and which 
it is believed should help small farmers
take part in the program was
that there be established a minimum
soil-building allowance of 20 00 per
farm Another important soil conservation
recommendation is one that
would allow farmers to earn up to
 30 00 per farm for tree planting in
addition to the regular soil building
allowance for the farm 
State and local AAA committeemen
it is claimed will have more responsibility
for the field administration of
crop insurance and loans This is in
line with established A A A policy o f
decentralizing administration of the
program wherever possible 
Wells explains that the national
conference was held a month earlier
this year than last to give farmers
a better opportunity to know well in
advance of the planting season what
the program has to offe r them 
Recommendations adopted at the
national conference will be used for
drafting specific provisions of the
1940 program Wells reports that in
general it will continue on the same
lines as the 1939 program Changes
recommended are those which will
simplify administration of the program 
or make it more effective from
the standpoint of soil conservation 
 The conservation program provides
for establishment of national allotments
for soil-depleting crops and
a national goal for soil-building crops
and practices which will be broken
down to individual farms declares
the state chairman The national
wheat allotment of 62 000 000 acres
for 1940 has already been announced 
Other special allotments including
corn and tobacco will be made
later in the season when the 1939
crop is definitely known Changes
in rates of payment on these commodities
will be made on the basis o f
what the allotments are for them 
As in 1939 there will be two different
payments which farmers may
earn in 1940 These are the conservation
payments and the price adjustment
payments

Just as we had come to the mournful
conclusion that nobody reads the
Cookie Jar any more along came two
good friends with recipes So we
hereby take a tuck in our drooping
spirits and carry on 
Beatrice Knutson of Black River
Falls sent in the two following recipes
:
F rozen C ookies
1 cup white sugar
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup shortening
3 eggs
1 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp soda
4 cups flour
Nuts if desired
These may be stirred up in the evening
and baked the next morning 
V in e g a r C ookies
2 cups brown sugar
1 cup shortening
2 eggs
2 tbsp vinegar
2M tbsp hot water
1 tsp soda
4 large cups flour
tsp vanilla
Drop from spoon or roll out as
desired 
Thanks a lot Beatrice 
Now that berries are in season and
so plentiful that we all can enjoy
them I hope you will try serving
them with dumplings The recipe below
calls for elderberries but blackberries
or almost any berries would
be equally as good 
E ld erb erry P u ffb a lls
Cook and sweeten 1 quart elderberries 
Add 1 tsp cinnamon and a
pinch of salt Make dumplings as
follows:
1 cup flour
3 tsp baking powder
1 tsp cinnamon
lA tsp salt
1 tbsp sugar
Vi cup sweet milk (about that)
Sift dry ingredients add enough
milk to make a soft dough Drop by
spoonsful in the hot berries and cook
for ten minutes turning them over
once gently with a large spoon 
During the winter when we have
hot biscuits I often open a jar of
blackberries heat them to the boiling
point and drop in bits of rich biscuit
dough cooking for ten minutes Served
with cream and sugar these
 dumplings make a simple and satisfying
dessert 
For something special in hot dishes
try this some time  
M innesota H ot Dish
1 lb ground beef
xk lb ground pork
1 can tomato soup
1 tbsp flour
Salt and pepper

MERLIN HULL S LETTER
There is much to be done before
adjournment of this congressional session 
should that adjournment be
postponed uv til at least some of it is
accomplished There are prominent
advocates of a continuous session in
view of the European situation Somehow
they have the idea that by remaining
here Congress might prevent
our becoming involved should the
war-masters of the countries across
the ocean suddenly stop growling and
go to fighting But our country never
can go to war constitutionally unless
Congress declares war The main
question is whether Congress will take
sides before the conflict even starts 
That is the main issue of the socalled
neutrality problem upon which
the administration is demanding action
at this time The Senate committee
to which the bill was referred
voted to postpone action on the measure
until the next session An attempt
may be made to obtain direct
Senate action in some other manner 
The fight comes over the continuance
o f the embargo upon munitions and
war materials included in the measure
by a House amendment The administration
desires that shall be stricken
out and the matter of such purchases
by warring nations shall be left to
the President 
In a few words the question revolves
around the meaning of neutrality 
 Absolute neutrality is desired
by many who believe that the only
way to keep our country out of a
foreign war is to avoid any form of
entanglement which may lead us into
one To close our ports and prevent
our resources being drawn upon by
other nations for wars the restrictions
applying to all countries alike 
might be considered the real meaning
o f neutrality The European
situation is alleged to depend somewhat
upon how closely we shall adhere
to that form of neutrality 
Great Britain and France now are
buying extensively war-planes in particular
as well as other forms of war
materials in general in their war preparations 
Germany has and probably
still is purchasing food supplies for
storage in anticipation of war The
German air forces have been equipping
with engines and other materials
from our side of the waters 
Italy has been drawing less heavily
upon our resources Under the present
law all those countries would
fare alike as to purchases from us if
war comes but none could buy arms
and munitions 
Were congress to repeal the embargo
upon arms and munitions the
power would then lie with the President
to regulate such sales Undoubtedly
Great Britain and France would
have control of the seas with their
great navies if war occurs under the
present line-up If the embargo is
repealed those countries thus might
be privileged to use our resources extensively 
while Germany and Italy
probably would not be able to get
here to buy anything It is that feature
which makes the embargo provisions
so important in the present emergency 
The extent of our neutrality
in the event of war may depend
upon what Congress does in and with
the present measure 
How quickly public sentiment 
when aroused can influence legislation
in Washington is quite well illustrated
by the President s backdown
on his proposed loan of 500
million dollars to foreign countries
with which to buy American goods
and products in his pending lending
program Though urged by the eastern
press as one of the most important
features of that lending program 
the protest which came so loudly from
the middlewest apparently had its effect 
The bill as presented has stricken
out the 500 million dollar loan intended
for South America and other
foreign countries Instead the authorization
o f the Export-Import Bank 
a government subsidized institution 
would be increased from 100 millions
to 200 millions were the bill adopted
in the form presented It is quite
likely that before the bill reaches the
House the Export-Import Bank fund
will be considerably curtailed 
A good big part of our national
debt as well as a large part of the
foreign investments by private citizens
o f our country are represented
in previous schemes of loaning money
to foreign governments national and
local with which to purchase American
products With the experience o f
the Reconstruction Finance Corporation
being accepted as a proper guide
for the domestic lending certainly
our experience in loaning money to
foreign countries has been sufficiently
bitter for us to stop look and
listen very intently before following
the custom farther 
One of the measures which brings
a flood of mail to the desks of congressmen 
is the new bill to extend
the slum clearance program Possibly
there are thousands of such letter
writers who know very little about
the bill The idea of clearing away
the slums of the large cities and permitting
people to live in decent modem
homes naturally appeals to
everybody Comparing the cost of a
single battleship with that of slum
clearance in a city like Chicago for
instance causes many people to conclude
that a country that is rich
enough to stand the cost of battleships
should stand the cost of new
housing 
The activity under the slum clearance
program is quite independent o f
that of the Federal Housing Administration
and the Home Owners Loan
Corporation under which loans for
home building are insured by these
government agencies The Housing
Authority insures the loans and provides
the financing for local housing
authorities which erects the buildings
for such projects Such homes are
leased at a monthly rental intended to
be nearly sufficient to meet the cost
o f operation and the payment of the
bonds which are sanctioned and floated
by the Housing Authority The
high cost of building particularly in
the centers most interested in slum
clearance makes the cost of the
homes greater by far than most peo-
CO-OP NEWS
( Earl Horswill)
Two of the three bills opposing
Coops have been defeated in the
Wisconsin assembly The bill to take
away the present authority of the
state department of Agriculture and
Markets to promote cooperatives was
killed 62 to 9 The bill to revoke the
1935 law requiring that the principles
o f cooperation be taught in the state
public schools was also killed when
only 11 assemblymen voted for the
measure The third bill proposing to
remove the state income tax exemption
for cooperatives has not yet been
reported on by the assembly committee
on excise and fees These
Anti Co-op bills were sponsored by
the Wisconsin Chamber of Commerce
lobbied and fought for by the Marketing
Association Inc a group of
private business men of Milwaukee 
Several cooperative associations 
credit unions and other non-profit
corporations in Indiana have purchased
controlling interest in the Citizens
State Bank at Beach Grove to facilitate
financial operations of these organizations
and to help any other financing
agencies giving banking service
to local co-ops This move was
sponsored by the Indiana Farm Bureau
and is the first bank of its kind
in the United States according to a
statement made by Mr I H Hull 
state manager While there is nothing
in the set-up to prevent individuals
from making deposits or negotiating
loans the bank will develop its
services among the organizations listed
above and will undertake to further
develop credit unions in the
state 
Three-fifths of the adult population
o f Scotland are members of Co-operatives
and leads the countries of the
world in percentage of Coop members 
sales per member and in the
amount of goods produced in cooperative
factories per member 
The latest addition to their long list
o f Cooperative factories is an electric
light bulb factory just completed in
Glasgow and will be dedicated in August 
Neil S Beaton president o f
the Scottish Cooperatives is now in
the United States making a tour o f
this country and Canada 
Several hundred members of the
Monroe County Cooperatives and
their friends met at the Log Cabin
park in Tomah last Sunday for their
annual picnic 
The program consisted of games 
speaking and contests Over 100 o f
cash and merchandise prizes were
given to the winners of the various
events 
Ray Steidl field representatives o f
Equity Cooperative Livestock Sales
Association of Milwaukee spoke on
the changing conditions in the marketing
o f livestock the problems we
have to face and explained about the
opposition that cooperatives are experiencing
from the packers and the
advantages of collective bargaining
through a central livestock cooperative
sales association such as the
Equity He strongly advocated the
advertising of meat and meat products 
Through advertising lard substitutes
are being sold pound for
pound of lard altho they are an inferior
product as to quality It is up
to the producers of livestock to advertise
likewise 
Joe Gilbert veteran worker in the
cooperative movement and editor o f
 Midland Cooperator spoke of Cooperation
as Nothing more or less
than the people working together to
accomplish something that could not
be done individually It is no visionary
proposition because it works The
products of the soil that were marketed
cooperatively last year in the
United States amounted to over two
billion dollars At one time a household
was almost self sufficient but as
civilization advances it becomes more
collective in its operations that is
why farmers had to organize as producers
so that through collective bargaining
they could receive more for
their products which gave rise to cooperative
elevators creameries shipping
associations etc They learned
the same principle applied to the purchasing
o f their supplies so the elevators
etc took over to the buying
o f farm supplies stores are being established
and cooperation is advancing
at a more rapid pace in the United
States than was ever experienced
in any foreign country 
Mr Donald Loeb representing the
Co-op Study Clubs of Monroe county 
gave a very interesting talk on
the need of cooperatives to the welfare
o f the people 
Monroe county along with Vernon 
Walworth and one or two others o f
this state recognize the need of county
wide Cooperative Advancement Associations 
such as we have in Jackson
county to bring about a closer
relation and working conditions of the
cooperatives in their respective counties 
The Black River Co-op club met on
Monday evening July 10 at the home
of Mr and Mrs Tom Stodola on
Black river 
Reports on the Study Club Conference
which was held at Minneapolis
on June 12 were given by Mrs 
Grant Grebel Richard Faldet Grant
pie who live in slums can afford to
pay The government has generously
contributed 28 million dollars a year
to pay the difference between the
actual cost of rentals and the rentals
paid Though this plan was inaugurated
only four years ago about
 500 million dollars has already been
spent in clearing away the slum sections
in large centers and in erecting
the new homes The cost to the government 
independent of the loans
made for the purpose has been rather
high Twenty-eight million dollars a
year in subsidies has been more than
equalled by the cost of administration 
and other expenses The plan 
however is very popular especially
in the larger centers in which they
are demanding the large government
subsidies and an increase of the authorization
for the project by another
800 million dollars 
It is the popularity of this housing
orogram which brings in the flood of
letters previously mentioned In considering
the new measure however it
is necessary to consider the ultimate
cost It is proposed to increase the
28 millions of annual subsidy to 73
million dollars and to extend that
subsidy over a period of sixty years 
when the government will have paid
four billion 380 million dollars toward
the rental charges of people living
in the homes erected bv local
housing authorities under the direction
o f the Federal Housing Authority 
That large a subsidy plus the
original expenditure of one tvl ;on six
hundred million is extr  oH in rrv 
MERLIN HULL
OFFICIALS INVESTIGATE
INDIAN SCHOOL
National and state government representatives
made a brief inspection
o f the Indian school property here
last Friday afternoon and were united
in their determination to find an
occupant for this fine property 
Included in this unofficial inspection
party were Rep Joshua L Johns 
Appleton; Rep John C Schafer Milwaukee;
Assemblyman H V Miller 
West Salem; and Dr F L Gullickson 
West Salem This committee was in
West Salem to attend the funeral o f
Rep Harry W Griswold and took
the opportunity to visit the Indian
school property here while in this
vicinity 
Rep John C Schaefer is a member
o f the Indian affairs committee
and was astounded to find a property
as substantial and extensive as the
school plant here without a tenant 
Rep Johns was interested in securing
some branch of government to be
housed in this fine property The
state assemblyman and Dr Gullickson 
who is chairman of the Republican
state committee were also deeply
interested in saving this property
for some good use 
The visit developed a plan for the
introduction of a resolution in the
state legislature asking that the
property be turned over to the state
for use as a veterans home or some
other good use and it is likely this
resolution will be introduced at the
earliest possible moment It is believed
there will be little difficulty in
securing this property for state use 
There are any number oi uses to
which the state might put this property 
chief among which is a veterans 
home and hospital and it would
appear to be good business policy for
the Indian department to turn this
property over to the state for that
purpose It may be expected that
something will develop from the visit
o f the congressmen here Friday

ROOMS FOR STUDENTS  
Miss Emma Neindorf home Ec instructor 
and Vernon Hanson agricultural
instructor are spending some
time in the adjoining territory contacting
students who have enrolled or
may enroll in their classes It is the
first time that a year round program
has been in force here and there is
a great deal of preparatory work in
connection with it 
One of the qeustions that they o ften
encounter is Where can my boy
or girl stay while attending school   
To help out in the matter it will be
very much appreciated by Bert F 
Johnson principal of schools if anyone
who is interested in students 
either to pay for room and board 
board themselves or work for room
or work for room and board will
call the office Phone 269 and give
their names If you have no phone 
drop a card It is hoped that by beginning
earlier this year a better arrangement
may be made 
I f all who can take care of students
in any of the above ways will
register at the high school office and
if parents with students will inquire
there it will serve as a clearing house 
I f some one with a large house and
lots of ambition would operate a
small profit dormitory here it might
afford an opportunity for some of the
students who find it hard to find a
place to stay within their means to
attend school
