On their way down they picked up
Don Johnson pianist o f L a Crosse
just outside o f West Salem where he
had been spending the day giving music
lessons and was starting to hitchhike
home They enjoyed a visit with
him and heard a most interesting
story regarding his recent trip to
New York City where he played before
some of the uncrowned heads
This information we gleaned from the
state papers from nothing that was
said by Mr Johnson The interesting
part o f the story was the fact that
while walking along the street a man
stepped up beside him and asked for
a quarter Then he walked along beside
Mr Johnson until they came to
a dark spot and held him up with a
gun taking everything he had except
50 cents We wonder if he left that
purposely or by accident Mr Johnson
was up against it penniless in a
strange city He finally remembered
he had an insurance policy and with
New York firm and borrowed enough
money on it to carry him along

Merlin Horswill Enoch Locken and

the kind that fish more in air
than water Anyway they wanted a
fish box for their jive bit They
have planned on it for a long time
and finally made arrangements with
the Homstad Lumber Comuany for
material Then they made thei- plans
and laid out the design Then they
went to work Even the three of
them were doubtful of the results as
they went along First it looked like
a surf board then like a babys play
pen Now it is completed but we cannot
tell you where it may be seen
for they have it well hidden until they
can protect their patent rights

The Rotary club has been working
 n e problem of the parking quesj
tion in this city which is becoming
i more of a problem right along The
community service committee of the
club worked out a program in the
I matter which was presented to the
city council at the last meeting It
is the contention of the commitee
that areas for parking should be provided
in different sections of the business
district wherever possible rather
than one central parking lot and
] they suggested corrections and improvements
on streets as well as providing
additional parking lots
Willard P Jones chairman Dr B
Shlimavitz Price Moe R M Matteson
were the members appointed to
the community service committee
with A H Frederikson and Duane
Hoffman appointed additional members
to act in the parking matter
The committee made an extensive
j study of conditions
j The following layout of the prob-
 lem and suggestions for remedying it
j is well worth study as it was pre-
 sented to the council by Dr Benj
I Shlimovitz in the absence of Willard
j P Jones chairman of the committee
I PROBLEM
A Provide additional parking space
for 
1 Farmers and regular traders
of business houses
2 Visitors and touring traffic
(including salesmen and professional
business callers) tran
sient in nature short time
parking
II SUGGESTIONS
A Main streets are at present used
to capacity It is possible in one or
two places to provide diagonal instead
of parallel parking Narrowness
of streets prohibits because of
safety factor Second street from
Main to Harrison (Pugh-Van Gorden)
Harrison east to 1st street
B Curbs and gutters and better
surfaced street will encourage parking
in certain areas Only a limited
increase  new Post office to Homstar
Lumber Yard Bert Jones-Brauner
block  Larkins to Banner-Journal
office
C Extend present city parking lot
Capacity can be enlarged Possible
to include rear of Cities Service
property in this area Space 30-50
additional cars
D New Areas  To be well lighted
supervised and policed
1 West of County Highway builling
150-200 cars
2 Rear of Freeman hotel 20-
30 cars
E River parking area  future program
only
F Restricted one or two hour parking
1 W ill assist transients Little
help to farmers or evening
parking Definitely not advisable
G Merchants and clerks cars to
park away from business center Approximately
50 cars
H Requesting WPA and other projects
to instruct men to use parking
area rather than all day parking on
street
III INC REASE
A Immediate increase in parking
areas must be provided for farmers
tourists and local automobile users
B Enlarge present area
C Arrange for use of areas at
Highway Garage and rear of Freeman
jHotel for private owners
D Provide lights parallel parking
and otherwise improve use of some
streets as suggested
E Construction of sidewalks curb
and gutter as Federal Aid Projects
F Use of parking lots by vans and
freight trucks nights and week ends
G Purchase of property by the
City with a planned program
H Newspaper publicity desirable
as regards traffic and speed regulations
and parking with emphasis on
Safety

The Legislature is now operating at
high speed there is apparently a
united effort to hurry the session
along to an early sine die adjournment
However the controversial
budget bill and the tax measures to
finance it may not be so easily disposed
of The much-debated Fitzsimons
Bill known as the married womens
employment bill has been defeated
and was refused reconsideration
The Teachers Tenure Bill was held
up pending action o f the school
boards convention held in Madison
a few days ago I understand that
this organization arrived at certain
recommendations relative to this subject
but they have not yet been presented
to the Legislature
The Goldthorpe Bill on civil service
will have a hearing in the Finance
committee Thursday May 4 it will
meet with strenuous opposition when
it comes before the Assembly for
consideration It is evident that some
of the Republican members are
against the wrecking features o f the
bill The bill whicn would prohibit
the insuring of county town and
school buildings with the State In surance
Commission will be up for
fin al passage next week This is a
very disputable matter and although
engrossed by a vote o f 50 to 40 it
w ill be difficult to pass it
The Integrated Bar Bill was refused
engrossment by a tie vote but
will probably be reconsidered next
Thursday A bill which would place
the issuance o f auto licenses with the
counties was engrossed and has a
probable chance o f passing the Assembly
The Bangs Disease bill has
been approved by both houses and
awaits the signature o f the Governor
Old-age pension bills are still being
held up in committees and will probably
be held there indefinitely
In case any of the school children
of Jackson county decide to visit the
Legislature they should i f possible
arrange to come either Wednesdays
or Thursdays and be present at
about 10 or 11 a m

 Insurance Information for the
Home Maker was the subject of the
talk by Mr Rufus Dimmick at the
meeting o f the American Home de- Sartment on April 25 at the home of
frs L J Gardipee Mr Dimmicks
talk was very interesting inasmuch as
he illustrated clearly various fine hazards
about the home He had constructed
the frame work o f a small
house and explained how fires might
easily start because o f rubbish piles
in the basement defective wiring
spontaneous combustion (often by
oily rags in a closet) and dry-cleaning
done in the house The purpose
o f a fuse was explained and Mr Dimmick
showed how a fuse was blown
by overloading the circuit with electrical
appliances O f great interest
also were the statistics showing fire
losses and lives lost in fires for each
o f several years just past These
common causes of fire were no doubt
impressed upon the minds o f those
who heard the talk

Well planned gardens have considerably
reduced the expenditures for
the home food supply and helped insure
good health for the borrower
families o f the Farm Security Administration
in Jackson county reports
Mary Jane Dodson FSA home
management supervisor at Black R iver
Falls
Many families in the county have
been able to meet all vegetables requirements
o f the family throughout
the entire year because of the fresh
stored or canned vegetables supplied
by the gardens In addition meals
can be made more interesting because
o f the variety available
According to the home supervisor
gardens are planned to furnish a
good supply of fresh vegetables needed
during the summer months and
enough additional so the homemaker
may can about 25 quarts of tomaatoes
and 35 quarts of other kinds of
vegetables for each member of her
family In addition three to five
bushels of potatoes and three to four
bushels of vegetables such as carrots
cabbage beets rutabagas and turnips
are recommended for storage
for each person
A fte r carefully considering preferences
of the family and their requirements
to provide an adequate yeararound
diet the family garden is
planned to meet these specifications
Farm gardens are an important contribution
to the family living reducing
the cash expenditures for the
home food supply by 150 or more
depending upon the size of the family
This money formerly spent for
food will be available for other living
expenses or for paying on indebtedness
the home supervisor stated
 During the year FSA borrowers
who need the help are advised as to
the best methods of caring for their
gardens and preserving its produce by
canning drying or storing Miss
Dodson said

The need for more intensive education
of the general public on cancer
control has been conclusively demonstrated
by the recent survey of
popular attitudes towards this disease
conducted by the American Institute
of Public Opinion  the Callup Poll 
according to three leaders of public
health work in statements made public
here by the Womens Field Army
of American Society for Control of
Cancer The statements were by
Thomas Parran Surgeon-General of
the U S Public Health Service Haven
Emerson M D Professor of
Public Health Practice at the College
of Physicians and Surgeons New
Y ork and C C Little Sc D Managing
Director of the American Society
for the Control o f Cancer
The survey among other points reveals
that cancer education has progressed
to a point where two out of
three persons know cancer is curable
if taken in time However it also
shows that one out o f five people
still think incorrectly that cancer is
contagious and 76 per cent o f the
public fear cancer more than tuberculosis
heart trouble or pneumonia
Ninety per cent of those queried fa vor
a bill pending in Congress to appropriate
3000000 each year to aid
states in establishing cancer control
programs The survey also shows that
the public has a variety o f beliefs
about causes of cancer Some of
these which can be brought together
under the heading of chronic irritation
are accurate others go far afield
such as eating meat vaccinations bad
thoughts vinegar etc
Dr Parrans statement follows
 The Gallup Poll on the publics
ideas about cancer has served again
to indicate great public interest in the
problem He has also demonstrated
that there are misconceptions regarding
the causes and ways of treating
cancer as well as increasing public
recognition that many types o f cancer
can be cured by tested methods
now known to medical science The
Poll has served a useful purpose in
again focusing public attention on
this problem and in pointing out what
might be termed the weak spots in informing
and educating the public regarding
cancer
 Whenever any disease is so widespread
in the population so serious in
its effect so costly in its treatment
that the individual cannot deal with it
himself  it becomes a public health
problem
 By every test and measurement
cancer is a public health problem In
fact it is one o f the most important
public health problems facing our
country today Cancer causes more
deaths than any other disease with
the single exception of heart trouble
Between the ages of 40 and 65 more
women die of cancer than from any
other cause Men and women of all
age groups are affected altho cancer
is regarded as primarily a disease of
older people
Present-day knowledge o f the causation
o f cancer and the nature of the
cancer process is however fa r more
extensive than is generally realized
Advances in knowledge always seem
slow but when one compares what we
know now with what was known in
1900 definite progress is plainly seen
While research is continuing its
steady march forward every effort
must be made to care for the cases
now known and to provide adequate
facilities to treat the thousands of
new cases discovered every year
Coupled with this work educational
efforts should be employed to bring
to public attention the known symptoms
of cancer and to impress upon
all our people the necessity o f consulting
the family physician or the
nearest cancer clinic when the first
hints of a possible cancer growth appear
Dr Emerson said The average
publics reaction to the questions on
cancer appears to me reasonable and
probably correct in view of their low
level of biological information and
critical intelligence Publicity and
propaganda will some day be replaced
by education in the facts involved in
self-preservation and avoidance and
protection against preventable cases
and deaths from cancer Not fear or
other emotions but curiosity as to the
truth about life and its enemies must
be used as the motive upon which
public understanding about cancer
should be based
Dr Little declared Not only are
the results of the Gallup Poll on Cancer
extremely interesting in showing
that a great deal of education remains
to be done but the mere fact
that the question has been introduced
by the poll is in itself of great educational
value
 The question that particularly interests
me is the one which shows that
the overwhelming majority o f people
dread cancer far more than any other
disease With knowledge concerning
it this dread can be made an active
force in conquering it whereas if
left without that knowledge it will
form the basis of more cancer phobias
which have already resulted in the
death o f so many individuals by paralyzing
any intelligent action

 Tuberculosis seeks its victims
among people who can least afford to
pay for long drawn-out illness it
was pointed out by the Wisconsin
Anti-Tuberculosis Association which
is in the last few days o f its 12th
annual Early Diagnosis Campaign
conducted during April
The tuberculosis deathrate of unskilled
labor throughout the country
is eight times that o f the professions
the W A T A states There is not
much difference between the deathrates
of white collar workers agricultural
workers and skilled labor
Yet there are a few skilled occupations
such as mining grinding and
foundry work which seem to be more
dangerous Indoor or outdoor work
also shows no marked difference 
Tuberculosis seems to be more
closely related to the economic status
o f the wage earner than to his occupation
according to figures published
by the National Tuberculosis
Association which points out that as
long as there is much tuberculosis
among the lower economic groups it
will find its way into the higher ones
During the month of April the W
A T A has appealed to the leaders
of Wisconsin to Help Find Early Tuberculosis
 The need for more early
diagnosis of this disease is demonstrated
by the fact that eight out of
every ten who come to the sanatorium
do not do so until they are in the
advanced stages o f the disease
Periodic examination including a
tuberculin skin test followed by a
chest x-ray of all reactors is recommended
by the W A T A

Then friends of brides-to-be start
planning a shower right away and
Mrs Romance Koopman Madison

suggestion that We can give any
young homemaker a head start in
housekeeping with a kitchen shower 
A shower should be planned around fifts to make housework easier Mrs
koopman says Dry fast dish towels
egg timers oiled silk bowl covers
sprays for rinsing dishes and glass
cooking utensils could be listed in this
group
Another sort o f shower would center
about making the kitchen attractive
For this Mrs Koopman suggests
bright colored curtains dish
towels or utensils
Then to plan for the party itself
Mrs Koopman believes a game of
 Mixed Recipes is just the thing
Each guest is given a card on which
is written three ingredients One
might be flour milk and salt A nother
might be butter apples and
vanilla Then the hostess slowly reads
off a list of other ingredients and the
first guest to complete a recipe is a
winner
A recipe box is a cherished possession
of any homemaker beginning or
not So its a thoughtful hostess who
gives this to her friend Before the
party the hostess could take any
square box and paste on it the brightly-
colored pictures o f food shown in
magazine advertisements Filing cards
in a box would carry the name of
each guest at the shower Then during
the party each guest would jot
down a recipe she thinks the bride
would enjoy making

F S A PROGRESS
IN F O U R C O U N T IE S
In a four-county area including
Jackson county the Farm Security
Administration has nearly completed
the sale of 72 farms to former tenants
Seven of these farms are located
in Jackson county
Farms have been purchased by the
following Vilas Troxel Alma Center
200 acres George Garbers A lma
Center 200 acres Harvey Harmon
Alma Center 200 acres Morton
Clark Alma Center 160 acres
and Harry De Groot Hixton 117
acres Two other farms one over 96
acres near Hixton and the other over
138 acres near Black River Falls remain
to be sold
Under this trial program carefully
selected tenant farmers are being
given an opportunity to buy family
sized farms from the government under
a 40-year amortization plan The
work is the result of the governments
effort to provide suitable land
for farmers being aided to relocate
v io u s ly in r e n t f o r th e la n d th e y
f a rm e d 
A number of the farms are being
sold to graduate rural rehabilitation
borrowers or farmers who secured
funds from the FSA to purchase
livestock and equipment The purchasers
selected from this group have
been making excellent progress and
have proven by their success with the
FSA that they are eligible for farm
ownership
The Farm Security Administration
follows the policy of selling farms to
these former tenants only after a
careful study of each familys character
ability as farm operators and
willingness to cooperate with the
project manager As an additional
protection of the governments investment
all loans are made on the
basis of sound farm and home management
plans worked out in advance
of the years farming program
In a typical farm and home management
plan income is balanced
against expenditures and provision is
R A Kolb manager of Central Wisconsin Farm Project of the
F SA and Miss Catherine Canney secretary
from certain submarginal land areas
into well developed agricultural communities
Nearly all farms in the
project were purchased by the government
from aged persons or othors
who wished to retire from farming
and from non-farming owners
The project includes in addition to
the 7 farms in Jackson county 15
farms in Marathon county 14 in
Wood and 36 in Clark Only those
families who were unable to secure
the necessary financial assistance
from private sources or other governmental
agencies for the purchase of
farms were eligible It was required
however that the financial status of
each family be such that reasonable
success could be expected on the project
farm Under the direction of the
Farm Security Administration all
made for the orderly repayment of
the loan from the cash balance The
plans provide for the production of
sufficient feed livestock and livestock
products Adequate provision is also
made for the family living and
each plan is adapted to the abilities
and characteristics of the individual
farmer and his family
Throughout the year the project
manager is ready to give the borrower
any assistance or advice he may require
or request on such matters as
livestock management selection of
feed cropping and other farm management
problems Likewise the
home management supervisor assists
the homemaker of the family on problems
concerning food preservation
diet clothing purchases and other
factors which contribute to a more

buildings needing repairs were put in
such condition that little or no repair
work would be necessary during
the first five or ten years of the purchase
period Only in a few instances
was it necessary to construct new
buildings
Sixty-four o f the 72 farms in the
area are now occupied by families
who are purchasing them All farms
are being sold to worthy farm families
under a plan which calls for annual
payments over a 40 year period
with interest at three per cent The
average amortization payment is
116588 to which must be added approximately
80 for taxes and 30
for insurance This is substantially
less than the owners had paid pre-

R A Kolb has served as the project
manager for the past year and is
assisted by Miss Mary Jane Dodson
home management supervisor The
latter also assists Douglas Curran
Jackson County FSA supervisor in
working with approximately 175
Jackson county families who have secured
rural rehabilitation or operating
goods loans from the FSA
Typical of those purchasing one of
these farms is the Edward Rogstad
family who rented farms in Wood
county for 11 years on a 50-50 basis
In commenting on how the Farm Security
Administrations purchase plan
was aiding them to become farm owners
Mr Rogstad said Our income
from farming on a rental basis was
not quite enough to carry us so in
1933 we left the farm to work on
I government dams near Quincy Illinois
and Guttenburg Iowa However
each time a contract was completed
Mr Ray Dorst who is buying an
I 80-acre farm located 11 miles NE of
 Neillsville with the aid o f an FSA
loan
the family had to move The children
lost much time in school and
you might say we never had a home
We wanted to get permanently settled
somewhere
In the spring o f 1937 they purchased
a 120-acre farm near Greenwood
from the FSA In addition they secured
a small construction loan for
building repairs and that same fall
without outside labor they built a
I new home at a total cost of 2214
It replaced an old log house There
is a full basement under the new
 home it is equipped with a furnace
and completely wired for electricity
1 which the Rogstads hope to have some
time in the future They have six
children
As another example o f the FSA aid
extended to a Clark county family to
become farm owners is the case of
Ray J Dorst The Dorsts were married
in 1927 and had little or no personal
property but in a few years accumulated
horses cows hogs and machinery
sufficient to operate a small
rented farm A year ago he purchased

Mr and Mrs Herman Meyer
In Wood county the Herman A
Meyer family is purchasing an 80-
acre larm under the governments
plan Mr Meyer a World war veteran
who served overseas operated a
40 acre farm in Auburndale township
for a number o f years and was also
employed by the Wood County Highway
department During 1937 he
rented a farm from the FSA
Mr Meyer had worked on this
same farm a number of years ago as
a farm hand and said From that experience
I was pretty well able to decide
what it would produce
The F SA s Central Wisconsin
Farms and similar projects in other
states have evolved into a forerunner
of a practical movement to curb tenancy
and absentee ownership of
farms Under the Bankhead-Jones
Farm Tenant Act operating for the
first time during 1938 37former tenant
farmers have been granted loans
for the purchase of their own farms
in seven Wisconsin counties
In addition to the Central Wisconsin
Farms Project and the tenant purchase
program more far-reaching aid
in solving the tenancy problem is being
extended farmers by the FSA
through improved leasing arrangements
between tenants and landlords
Emphasis is placed on long term renewable
contracts and on agreements
which will encourage tenants to protect
the soil and improve the property
This is being carried on by the
FSA county supervisors in conjunction
with the rural rehabilitation
loans which are aiding hundreds ofdistressed
farmers in staging a comeback
and becoming permanently selfsupporting

neighbors who already have had the opportunity to see the
extra safety economy and performance of Mansfield Tires
T H R E E W A Y S S A F E R
Mansfield Tires are three ways safer because they are built three
ways differently from other tires For instance Cord-Lock con
struction puts 31 more full weight cord fabric into the sidewalls
reinforcing the tire against flexing strains The high tensile steel
piano wire beads are seven times as strong as actually needed
Mansfield treads are made of tougher Duro-mix rubber today
still more resistant to high speed wear and pavement b urn from
fast starts and quick stops Every Mansfield Tire gives you more
mileage than you pay for

Cancer can be cured when adequately
treated in its early stages and
nearly always fatal according to Dr
Boxer who spoke at the meeting at
the school house last Thursday night
The auditorium was filled just about
to capacity and every person listened
with great interest to the talk
The doctor explained that object o f
the meetings throughout the country
was to eliminate cancer fatalities by
informing the public of the symptoms
and cures of the disease He pointed
out that cancer is at first a small
spot or lump which spreads and produces
other similar growths throughout
the body It usually starts in tissues
that have become diseased by
some form of chronic irritation or inflammation
The following signs may mean cancer
and therefore should receive
treatm ent
1 Any lump in the breast or
other part o f the body especially one
which begins to grow or change
2 Any sore which does not heal
particularly on the face or in the
m o nth 
3 Any unusual discharge or bleeding
from any part of the body
About 80 per cent o f the people
who die of cancer could have been
saved if they had gone to a doctor
when the disease was in its early
stages he pointed out
 There is no pain in the beginning
o f any kind of cancer By the time
pain occurs said Dr Boxer the cancer
is usually so fa r advanced that
it is hopeless The only effective
methods of treatment of cancer are
surgery radium and x-rays Whenever
any suspicious symptoms appear
the advice of a competent physician
should be obtained without delay
The main point to be remembered
according to the doctor is that many
cases of cancer can be cured i f they
are discovered at the beginning and
are properly treated without delay
The talk was illustrated with slides
but they were very small and did not
go over very good with most of the
audience However the talk was in teresting
and should be the means of
lessening the inroads of this dread
disease

 Cost o f Production for farm products
has been repeatedly endorsed by
nearly all the political parties in their
campaign platforms That 30 per cent
of our people should be asked to fu rnish
the food supply o f the nation at
a loss to the producers seems so ridiculous
that cost o f production
promises are widely made A t present
with the prices on farm products at
or near the all-time low the issue
looms larger than ever Still when
an endeavor is made to carry out platform
promises on this issue it is d ifficult
to obtain action even on the
part of some who have the opportunity
of forwarding the necessary legislation
Eighteen senators and about 40
congressmen have sponsored or presented
an identical cost-of-productio
n bill at this session The Senate
committee on Agriculture held hearings
on the plan amd favorably reported
it to the Senate where it is
pending The bill would authorize a
program under which farmers would
receive a fixed price at cost-of-production
upon all farm products to be
consumed in this country In the case
o f surpluses the over-supply would
be taken care o f by governmeaital
agencies under the plan proposed in
the measure Probably the practical
application of such a program would
require careful consideration and
possibly amendments to the bill might
be necessary
The same bill now before the Senate
is also before the House committee
on Agriculture There it has
met with the sturdy opposition of
some of those who prefer the present
system o f farm relief which relates
mainly to cotton com wheat
rice and tobacco Those products
form but about half the total of our
farm production but with principal
attention paid to cotton in which the
government now has am investment of
over 700 millions the other four
crops have a minor share in the working
out o f the law Satisfied to a degree
with the governments liberality
toward cotton those interested in that
staple are not inclined to favor a
plan which would include all agriculture
in all parts o f the country
Consequently the House committee
voted as strongly against the cost-ofproduction
bill as the Senate committee
did fo r it By a vote o f 17 to 6
the committee voted not to permit
the measure to come before the House
for a vote Now the only course open
to the friends o f the measure is by
petition a rough and difficult course
as frequently has beein the case when
House and committee leaders unite to
block action The Ludlow war amendment
and the farm refinancing bill
were both blocked even though a
clear majority of the members signed
the petition in each instance
The dairymen and business men of
Wisconsin are unitedly behind the
movement to have dairy products included
as basic commodities under the
present farm plan with parity price
fixing as has been done with cotton
com wheat etc The measure for this
dairy parity program is being carefully
drawn and is about ready for
presentation A large delegation of
Farm Union members and other farmers
is in Washington and they are
strongly backed by the aroused interest
o f the people o f Wisconsin and
Minnesota dairy districts organized
by the Dairy Business Parity League
They want the same plan for dairy
products as the government provides
for cotton and other crops They are
preparing to urge their measure and
its merits upon the committees o f Senate
and House They demand action
at this session and present conditions
in the dairy markets certainly
emphasize the need o f that immediate
action The dairy people o f the northwest
who have suffered greater losses
in the past few years than any other
line o f farming and whose repeated
and continued demands have hitherto
not been complied with are now
in the fight to obtain the recognition
they so urgently meed They will have
the vigorous support o f their congressional
representatives many o f whom
have worked long and earnestly to obtain
government policies which would
put dairyland back on a firm foundation
The presidents plan for re-organization
o f the independent bureaus of
the government and their consolidation
in the interest of efficiency and
economy is in part before Congress
through his message embracing his
proposals Other recommendations
will come later His present proposal
would affect government bureaus
with more than 90000 employees
Numerous activities now carried on
by several agencies will be combined
under new administrators without
losing any o f their functions and in
some instances without change o f direct
supervision There may be a
dropping out o f some o f the employees
in minor positions but probably
no great change will occur among
the higher-ups 
The president estimates that there
will be an annual saving of fifteen
or twenty millions annually As appropriations
have been made for the
consolidated agencies for the next
fiscal year probably any great economy
will not become apparent for
months to comc Unless both houses
o f Congress shall disapprove the presidents
order o f consolidation within
sixty days it will go into effect at
the end o f that time There seems to
be little likelihood o f Congress interfering
Six new positions o f 10000
per annum and numerous positions a
little less lucrative will be created by
the order
Aside from the general features o f
the re-organization program another
indication of the great expansion o f
federal activities is apparent The
Social Security consolidation for instance
will bring under the supervision
o f one administrator a force of
17500 employees A t present the Social
Security Board organized within
the past three years has about 7000
employees The increase o f force will
come from the additional divisions
consolidated with it and will not
mean the employment o f additional
forces
Still another instance worthy of

Orchard Sprays
 Spray the Way to Better F ru it
may well be our orchard management
slogan for 1939
The S itu a tio n Practically all farm
orchards and many commercial orchards
had considerable scab infection
on the leaves of apple trees at the
time o f apple picking last fall This
means that the dead leaves on the
ground are carrying the infection
over and will if weather conditions
are favorable (rainy and cool) result
in much scabbiness of foliage
and fruit before the summer is over
How to Prevent Scab Infe ctio n
Protection against heavy scab infection
early in the season lies in frequent
lime sulphur sprays during the
early bud leaf and fruit development
using 2 gallons of liquid lime
sulphur to 100 gallons of water The
first spray should be applied when the
buds show a small green tip (These
green tips are the beginning of the
first leaves) Cover them thoroughly
with the lime sulphur mixture and
repeat with a second spray as soon as
the first small leaflets make their
appearance  this may be a week or
more after the green tip spray was
made The third scab spray should be
applied as soon as early blooming varieties
such as Snow and Yellow
Transparents are nearly in fu ll pink
and the application of this spray
completed before the blossoms have
opened ( I f it happens that you
must spray trees when in fu ll bloom
be sure to omit the lead arsenate)
The formula for the third or Pink
spray is
2 gal liquid lime sulphur and 2 to
2 lbs lead arsenate to 100 gal water
Beginning with the pink spray
lead arsenate is added for control of
curculio cankerworm and tent caterpillar
W h a t to Spray in Each Spray
1 Green tip  all fruit trees
Use Black Leaf 40 or nicotine sulphate
in this spray on young trees
which carry many aphids on the
smooth one year shoots
Use Ms pint to 50 gallons of spray
mixture
2 Prepink  All apple and pear
trees young and old
3 Pink  A ll apple and pear trees
also plum and cherry varieties which
have dropped the shucks from the
fruit
Raspberry and C u rra n t Sprays A ll
raspberries black purple and red
are heavily infected with anthracnose
this spring and should receive a lime
sulphur spray o f 1 gallon o f liquid
lime sulphur to 10 gallons of water
just as the first small leaves appear
Add about 1 pound of powdered milk
to this solution for better spread o f
the spray
D o rm a nt Spray Most o f our spray
ring orchards will not need any dormant
spray Long neglected orchards
will benefit much by a dormant
lime sulphur spray a week or two
ahead of the time o f the green tip
spray using the lime sulphur at 1 to

conviction and artistry it tells a tale
of trust and faithfulness enduring in
the face of suspicion and malice A
man arrested on a triflin g charge
finds himself upon his release branded
in the eyes of the world A young
girl who carries a stigma o f her own
accidently meets him and a love true
and strong and real springs up between
them How they manage to
keep this flame pure and burning in
spite of temptations and gossip constitutes
the core of a human and moving
drama
Screened against a setting o f modem
Norway the picture makes delightful
detours into the undisturbed
rural country-side where ancient
customs are still revered and cherished
The smartness of up-to-date life
melt into scenes of dewy fragrance
And underneath the changing surface
the action is charged with seriousness
force and intent

In an unexpected move May 1st on
the part of 38 Stock (Old Line) Cas
ualty Insurance Companies a sharp
reduction in Auto Liability and Property
Damage Insurance rates went
into effect in 31 states including Wisconsin
This came as a surprise as
the Old Line companies has always
adhered to the regular published insurance
rates on auto insurance in
spite o f some loss in business during
the depression years The rate drop
applies to private passenger autos
that are not used for business purposes
except to go to and from work
-Tie reduction is 20 on such cars
and an additional 5 i f the cars are
not driven over 7500 miles per year
and if only one other member o f the
car-owners household operates the
car both to be 25 years old or ovef
It is reported that this reduction is in
addition to the customary Safe Driver
Reward rebate given by the same
38 stock companies during the past
year whereby the car-owner is paid
back 15 o f his premium i f he has
had no loss during the policy year
Mrs Ben Shlimovitz was guest of

Mrs Archie Ketchum of Millston
spent a day recently with Mrs Peter
Brevig and they had the finest kind
o f a visit The two ladies were neighbors
in Millston and had not seen
each other since Mrs Brevig moved
from there forty years ago so they
had a lot to talk over
note is the immense power over federal
credit systems which will be exercised
by the administrator chosen
fo r consolidation o f the lending bureaus
The present agencies will be
continued as they are but the single
administrator will be in supreme command
and direct th policies which
will control possibly six or eight billions
of dollars o f federal credit and
credit insurance Possibly no government
department aside from the
Treasury and its stabilization fund
and other financial divisions will have
such great powers and responsibilities

One of the fishing stories going
the rounds started probably by some
imaginative fisherman goes something
like this A fisherman heard a loud
splashing and swirling o f water and
continued yapping something like a
dog Being curious the man went up
stream to investigate and what does
he see but a water puppy chasing
a red horse To the uninitiate of underwater
lore a water puppy is a
water lizard very comomn in local
waters
Last Sunday afternoon at Indian
Mission grounds was alive with feverish
activity The Merrillan girls of
All-star rating calling themselves the
 Merrillan pick-ups showing great
determination to win against heavy
odds lost two games to the Hotonga
Indian girls The first game o f kitten
ball the score was 6 to 0 Then
they dropped two games of volley ball
We might have been in Hollywood
for all the beautiful types of young
womanhood running all over the mission
diamond I can truthfully say
every one enjoyed their visit and we
sincerely hope they will come to play
in the near future Evidently the
 pickups enjoyed their visits to the
mission too It must be remembered
the tepees and wigwams have no latch
or latch-strings The girls were welcomed
everywhere they called The
girls tell of seeing a strange game
where men were hiding a marble under
furry things and others had to
guess where the marble or pebble was
hid by striking with a long stick I f
I remember rightly the Merrillan
Pickup team was composed of the
following young femmes Heavy
Bouchard catcher Genie Erickson
pitcher Shine Erickson short
stop R ufus Matte 1st base A nnie
Snyder 2nd base Christie 3d
base Gertie Quinn fielder Jerry
Quinn fielder
Arvina Lowe o f the Hotonga girls
made up the other player
Come again real soon girls but
first get a lot o f practice
The Merrillan men team under the
expert coaching of Tractor Metalas
and with strong backing of the veteran
Carl Snyder the internationally
known sport scribe and commentator
lost their games of soft ball and volley
ball to the Hotonga Warriors It
was a day well worth spending at the
old mission
A short short story Old daddy
Time sat upon his throne Behind
him were strewn golden effigies altars
and fortresses unconquerable I
am the ultimate conqueror o f all
things I conquer them all none
withstands me Would you care to
oppose me young m an 
 I would be very glad to accept
your challenge to a combat Father
Time said the young man with a
time book in his hip pocket and an
imposing array o f pens and pencils
clipped to his shirt pocket I too am
the ultimate conqueror of all things
ambition and resourcefulness and
even including you Father Time I
am the champion time killer on the
project
