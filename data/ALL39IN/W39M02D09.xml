Budget Economy
Major task of legislators this week
is the beginning of hearings on the
budget recommendations for the next
two years aa delivered to them verbally
and in w riting by Governor Julius
P Heil last Wednesday
The total budget recommended by
the governor is somewhat more than
66 million dollars It is difficult to
compare Governor Heils budget with
th a t of his predecessor In 1937 Ex-
Governor La Follette submitted a
budget calling for the expenditure of
approxim ately 63 millions but after
the legislature had added emergency
relief appropriations total expenditures
reached 70 millions Governor
H ells budget recommendations contain
no provisions for relief As in
1937 this will be added by the legislature
Observers in the capitol point out
th at after the legislature has added
appropriations for relief Governor
Hells economy if any will am ount to
slightly more than 200000
Budget Items
Bigge st reductions in Heils budget
recommendations are at the expense
of the University of Wisconsin the
sta te teachers colleges and penal and
correctional institutions
The governors recommendations
would give the university a million
dollars less than it has operated on in
the past two years and is alm ost 7
million less than that requested by
President Clarence A Dykstra
S tate teachers colleges were cut
750000 compared to that which they
received in the past two years
Penal and correctional institutions
in the state if the Heil budget is approved
will receive about one million
dollars less than they received during
the biennium which expires June 30
Employees of state departm ents
can also expect pay cuts inasmuch as
Heil has recommended a slash of
613000 for sta te departm ents boards
and commissions
Largest increase in the new governors
budget is for charitable and
pension aids This the largest item
in the budget calls for an expenditure
-of 17 millions an increase of
1319000 over La Follettes budget
O ther small increases are scheduled
for institutions for the chronic insane
and for county tuberculosis sanatoria
The Governors Message
Legislators assembled last week in
joint session to hear the recommendations
of the governor on the states
spending program for the ensuing biennium
also heard a denunciation by
the governor of the financial tactics
of his predecessors
Governor Heil pointed out th a t the
budget task this year was extremely
difficult because of the deplorable
conditions of state finances He
offered statistics to show that the
sta te has operated in the red for the
past eight years
In each of these years the governor
said the expenditures under the
governors budget have exceeded the
receipts under the governors budget
As a result of this sleight-of-hand
procedure the cash position of the
state general fund is now so impaired
th a t it is a m atter of grave concern
The governor explained th at by
June 30 1939 there will be a net
cash deficit of 35 million dollars
whereas on June 30 1930 there was
a cash surplus of one million Of the
35 million dollars deficit more than
25 million is owed to the state high
way fund
 During the past eight years he
continued the sta te has been able to
pay its bills only by spending cash
balances accumulated for specific purposes
which in effect nullifies and
destroys the state budget system 
Tax Worry
Chief worry of legislators following
the governors budget presentation
is not the fact that the state has
a book-deficit of 35 million dollars
but rather th a t the regular sources of
revenue available in the next two
year period are estimated to yield approximately
45 million dollars nearly
21 million dollars short of the proposed
budget
Legislators can write off the 35 million
dollars deficit which one departm
ent of state owes another but some
new tax m easures are in order to meet
the sta te expenses It is expected
th at the special dividends tax the
chain store tax and the 60 per cent
income surtax will be reenacted and
will account for 7 million of the 21
million dollar shortage Other possibilities
are a luxury tax a sales tax
a cigarette tax and perhaps a more
lucrative chain store tax It is also
possible th at the legislature may appropriate
some of the highway tax

More w ars have been fought from
the speakers platform than on the
battlefield More w ars have been
averted the sam e way When news
first leaked out that Reichschancellor
Adolf H itler would celebrate
Nazidom s sixth anniversary with a
speech every able-tongucd sta te sm
an in E urope hastened to speak
first because there was well-founded
evidence th at H itler would announce
a new program of G erm an
aggression for 1939 Since France is
being hounded for territorial concessions
by G erm anys ally Italy and
since G reat Britain is F ra n ces
friend both London and P aris were
NO 2 NAZI GOERING
    s ta n d s e r e c t a m i d t h e u u r l d  
discouragingly anxious that H itler
should speak no evil of them
The situation w as plain Britain
and F ran ce w ere ready to appease
once m ore because after each successive
appeasem ent it becomes
m ore difficult to resist Boasted No
2 Nazi H erm an Wilhelm Goering:
The greater G erm any stands erect
am id the world firmly knit a steel
block of strength and cohesion Free
is the country    broken are the
shackles of the reparations system 
The honor and independence of the
nation are safeguarded by the party
and the new G erm an defense powre
r 
These were fighting words but
neither F ran ce nor B ritain was willing
to fight back Two days before
H itler spoke British Prim e Minister
Neville C ham berlain gave his
speech indicating th at far from being
stronger Britain will resist dictatorships
only under the m ost unlikely
em ergencies:  Peace could
only be endangered by    a dem
and to dom inate the world by
force This m eans th at little by little
Mr C ham berlain is willing to
concede to Italo-G erm an dem ands
Completely ignored were the Spanish
situation and Italian claim s
against France
The sam e day French Foreign ;
M inister Georges Bonnet hastened ;
to m ake his peace with dictators:
 R egardless of the violence of the j
Italian press cam paign (for French !
M editerranean territories) I have |
w arm friendship for the Italian people
M Bonnet practically accepted
M ussolinis dem ands when he declared
Italy had been treated badly
during and after the World w ar by
F ra n ce and Britain
Such tactics fell little short of an
outright invitation for H itler and
Mussolini to m ake dem ands By
the tim e Der F u eh rer m arched to
the rostrum in B erlins Kroll opera
house every E uropean e a r w as
cocked By the tim e he left Europe
and the world knew w hat to expect
from H itler in 1939:
On Colonies G erm any will d em
and th at all her pre-World w ar
colonies be returned otherw ise the
Reich will  rem ain an explosive factor
in E urope Reason: G erm any
m ust have access to raw m aterials
The alternative is to force exports
On Italy  W ar against Italy for
any reason w hatever will see G erm
any and Italy side by side said
H itler This statem ent is expected
to bring an im m ediate resum ption
of Italian claim s against F rance
though F rance and B ritain m ay inte
rp re t it with tongue in cheek
 W ar against Ita ly  m eans aggression
against Italy which is farthest
from dem ocratic thoughts Though
hoping H itler m eant to infer that
he would not assist in aggression by
Italy London and P a ris knew this
was a futile hope
On O ther Demand Allied reparations
dem ands against G erm any
after the World w ar were  unreasonable
and irresponsible  Hence
G erm any has been forced to m ak e
m ore com petitive efforts in the
world m ark et Hinting at alm ost
anything Der F u eh rer dropped the
rem ark th a t  forceful redistribution
of the w orlds riches w as inevitable
from tim e to time
On In tern al Affairs The battle to
overcom e the  extrem ely grave economic
condition has been won with
a  terrific fight but m ust go on
F rom such a speech only one conclusion
could be draw n: T hat the
Rom e-Berlin axis will devote 1939
to pressing clearly defined dem ands
against F rance and B ritain before
the latte r two nations have tim e to
bring their arm ed strength up to
par After colonies have been restored
after Italy has won her
claim s against F rance it will be
tim e enough for G erm any to turn attention
to the project closest to her

Production shortcom ings of U S
airplane m anufacturers have bothered
President Roosevelt all winter
especially since he discovered G erm
anys aviation industry w as probably
working at a m uch faster pace
To encourage air developm ent as a
defense precaution the Presidents
552000000 special arm s request included
a sizeable budget for arm y
and navy planes But congressional
appropriations come slowly; the
White House wanted to give aviation
a m ore im m ediate stim ulant
Brought back from France last
month by Am bassador William C
Bullitt w as news th at P rem ier Edouard
D aladiers governm ent would
spend 65000000 on Am erican-built
planes provided the U S gave permission
Here was the im m ediate
stim ulant President Roosevelt
sought but he kept F ra n ces proposition
a secret F irst leak in the
plans cam e when a new Douglas
light diving bomber scheduled for
entry in arm y competition crashed
at Los Angeles Test Pilot Paul
Cable was killed but congress evidenced
far m ore interest next day
in the news that an injured passenger
was Capt Paul Chemidlin representative
of the F rench air ministry
M
issouris Sen Bennett Champ
Clark dem anded all inform ation
about F rench plane purchases be
m ade public His com plaint:  I am
interested in ascertaining w hether
the F rench governm ent is being perm
itted to obtain options on latesttype
planes which have not been
available to our own a rm y  Barked
North D akotas Sen G erald P Nye
the nations No 1 pacifist:  The airplane
deal with F rance    constitutes
in my opinion a m ilitary alliance
But as facts were produced at the
inquiry Senator C larks fright
seem ed far out of proportion No secret
arm y aviation devices had been
c arried on the ship More im portant
the bom ber w as not an arm y
order hence there was no violation
of the rule forbidding foreigners to
see or buy airships designed for
arm y use N evertheless the plane
could not be replaced by M arch 1
when com petitive U S tests are
scheduled Since the Douglas bomber
was undoubtedly the fastest ever
developed arm y chieftains could
rightfully be angry But what m ade
them hopping m ad was the fact th at
F ra n ces plans had been discussed
not with the w ar d epartm ent but
with the navy
P resident Roosevelt com m ented
that it would be fine for French ord
ei3 to be filled here thereby ex-
C ongress
L ast autum ns election showed the
new congress would be conservative
But no real test of President
Roosevelts power w as expected until
debate began over the 1939-40
budget scneduled to boost the U S
public debt by 3326000000 Moreover
congress w as apparently willing
tc give the President his 875-
000000 deficiency relief appropriation
im m ediately leaving debate
over politics-in-relief to a later date
But all such forecasts are now
disproved In the relief deficiency
request (designed to carry WPA expenses
from M arch 1 to June 30)
congress saw a symbol of continued
big U S expenditures F irst the
house deducted 150000000 Next the
senate approved the reduced appropriation
sending it back to the
house with am endm ents to curb politics-
in-relief Thus a showdown between
White House and congress
has been precipitated unexpectedly
but observers could see far m ore
than m ere relief entering the picture

tru e w hether H enry
M orgenthau J r  retire

M orgenthau

T he driving force behind the move
to get M orgenthau out of the tre a s ury
does not com e from the White
House It com es from H enry M orgenthau
Sr fath er of the se cre ta ry 
The elder M orgenthau thinks H enry
h as given enough of his tim e to the

Although th e se c re ta ry of the

sta te m e n ts which seem ed to

In m ost of the b attles w aged inside

M orgenthau It is very probable
th a t M orgenthaus b attles inside the

B ig Insurance Companies
Stto n to lie In v e s tig a te d
Very shortly the monopoly investigating
com m ittee will tu rn its at-
| tention to the big insurance com panies
E ver since there has been a
1 New Deal there h as been an eageri
ness on the p a rt of the left w ingers
to get after these huge financial institutions
The two things th a t will be gone
into very thoroughly according to
| the frank sta te m e n ts of those in terested
will be the investm ent policy
of the m an ag em en ts of th ese com panies
and the loans th a t the com panies
m ake on policies A b itter
battle is expected here for the insurance
com panies have a good deal
of the pride of authorship or
achievem ent so to speak in their
investm ents and they feel very
strongly ag ain st liberalizing their
policy loan system 
This last can be dism issed so
briefly that it will be sta te d first
Insurance official usually favor a
6 per cent in terest ra te on such
loans T here a re two m ajo r considerations
One is to m ake the
loans easy to obtain T hat is for
the policy h olders benefit and to
m ak e the holding of policies an advan
tag e B ut th e o ther is to m ake
the in te re st ra te high so th a t the
b orrow er will have an incentive to
pay off the loan thereb y clearing
his policy and thus m ain tain the
m ax im u m of in su ran ce protection
w hich of course is the m ain object
of the policy and the m ain business
of the com pany
New D ealers do not like th e high
ra te  because one of the objectives
of New Deal econom ics is to put
in te re st ra te s dowrn This policy has
a lread y h u rt the insurance co m p anies
enorm ously It has reduced
the in terest ra te on bonds which
fo rm erly paid m uch g re a te r sum s
into the insurance com pany tre a su ries
As a n a tu ra l result this has
reduced very heavily the dividends
paid to policy holders or credited
on th eir policies in the form of additional
insurance
Terrific Falling O ff of
Investm ent in Utilities
Not only h as New Deal policy re duced
the ra te of in terest on govern
m en t bonds but it h as reduced
the in terest on the bonds of p riv ate
corporations T his phase was
 plan n ed  th a t way But another
phase w as not Yet as a resu lt of
governm ent com petition w ith the
electric industry th ere w as a terrific
falling off of new investm ent in the
utilities and as a result of S E C
restrictio n s and other New D eal activities
private corporations issued
so few new bonds th a t it b ecam e a
problem for the insurance com panies
or for th a t m a tte r any investors
to place th eir funds
As a result bonds a lread y outstanding
which w ere known to be
good advanced in price thus lowering
the retu rn on any new p u rch
ases th a t the insurance com panies

A iken Stirs Bitterness
Inside N ew Deal Circles
T h ere is m ore bitterness inside
New Deal circles over the stand
taken by Gov G eorge D Aiken of
V erm ont on the flood control and
power situation than is generally
realized The real tip-off of the
feeling is revealed in the outburst
on the floor of the house ju st after
Aiken took his stand by Rep John
E R ankin of M ississippi
R ankin charged th a t Aiken was
m aking a bid for the R epublican
p residential nom ination w ith the
backing of the  New E ngland power
tr u s t
Rep C harles A Plum ley of Verm
ont defended his governors a ttitude
saying th a t it w as a question
of w hether the federal governm ent
had a right to tak e sta te p roperty
w ithout the s ta te s consent
A ctually neither presented the
Whole picture and the White House
is not giving it either Boiled down
New E ngland has a serious flood
problem  It is bigger than any one
sta te  H eadw aters in both New
H am pshire and V erm ont pour into
riv ers p articu larly the Connecticut
which flood out territo ry in M assach
u setts and Connecticut
Hence there is plenty of reason
for regarding this whole Connecticut
I valley as one problem  and a fed-
! e ra l problem  ra th e r than a problem
j for the individual sta te s concerned
I A ctually there would be no dispute
about this if it w ere not for the powe
r angle
W ould Make Connecticut
Valley Miniature T V A
B ut the New Deal would like to
m ake a m iniature TVA of the Conn
ecticut valley W hether it goes far
or not it is determ ined to control
the power situation involved in any
dam construction for the purpose of
flood relief The purposes of the
adm inistration are perfectly sim ple
It w ants to handle th at power It
w ants to fix ra te s som ew hat com parab
le to TVA rates
It is not su rprising th a t the White
House and public power advocates
do not understand
this situation On
the su rface it would
seem as if m ost of
the New E nglanders
and p articularly
the Verm ont consu
m e rs would be as
e ag e r for cheaper
electric rates as the
people of the Tennessee
valley towns
But for som e reason
th ere is very little
evidence of this despite
the allegation th at the electric
ra te s in V erm ont a re m uch higher
than those charged by the p riv ate
com panies in the Tennessee valley
p rior to TVA
But on ex trao rd in ary sta te s rights
feeling has developed in V erm ont
They will do th eir own regulating
they seem to say
It m ay be recalled th at a while
back G overnor Aiken w as hailed in
m any q u a rte rs as a new type of R epublican
a m em ber of a p ro g ressive
group which w as going to
lead the G O P out of its re a c tionary
m orass In fact he w as frequently
m entioned as a presidential
possibility
So the fact th at he is attack in g
the New Deal on the electric power
question which is one of the very
first am ong the m any  p ro g ressiv e
issues is very annoying to the White
House to Sen George W N orris

H ale continued  I d like to ask you
about another guest thereÄîMrs
Spencer Forbes Do you know h e r? 
 Ruth Spencer Forbes? Of course
I know her Who doesnt know h er
replied Stuyvesant Shes a pal of
m y m o th ers She often com es to the
house I ra th e r like her m yself
Shes good fun if you get her in
the right mood F our o r five cockta
ils usually do it The things I ve
h eard th a t w om an say! W hat did you
w ant to know about R uth Spencer
F o rb e s?  he ended m ore seriously
 I suppose you know sh e s on the
financial rocks Alm ost everyone
is ju st now But I think her position
is w orse than m ost
ÄòÄòYes som eone spoke of that
S hes spending the su m m er with
M iss H osanna K neeland
Stuyvesant nodded
 I ve heard of her Ruth picks
e m up w herever she finds em 
Shes like Ainsw orth in th a t respect
v ery dem ocratic I suppose Miss
K neeland has alw ays bowed down
before R uth and Ruth has taken it
like Buddha on a shrine She would
T h at rem inds m e of som ething else
Isn t th ere an heiress of sorts in te
K neeland fam ilyÄîa girl called June
or Joan or som ething?
 T here is
 And is she easy on the ey e s!
Stuyvesant spoke enthusiastically
 I m et h er tw ice last w inter I
w anted to m eet her oftener but she
dropped out of sight in the spring
Is it h er house youre v isiting?
 I ts h er uncles Cam p but sh es
th e re 
 Youre in luck Stuyvesant said
sim ply  Say old m an couldnt
you get m e down there for a weeken
d ? 
 I ll suggest it to h e r Hale
sm iled
The w aiter w as clearing the table
for the salad The two young men
a te th eir luncheons and talked of
o th er things Then Stuyvesant
jum ped to his feet
 I m ofT he announced  but I ve
got to see m ore of you I hope I ve
told you w hat you w ant How about
m y putting you up at the E n g in eers
Club? Would th a t be u seful?
 Very m uch so Thanks It m ight
be convenient to have som e place
I can use for town appointm ents
Y oure treatin g m e m ighty well
Stuyvesant I wont forget it
 W hats your present a d d ress?
H ale gave him the ad d ress and
telephone num ber of the K neeland
town house and the C am p address
as well The two young m en faced
each o ther ra th e r self-consciously
 Dont drop out of sight again 
Stuyvesant said
 You bet I wont They shook
h ands enthusiastically
D octor Gordon D ew ar had m ade
th e appointm ent with m ore than resignation
 I ll see you right after
m y office h ours he prom ised  Not
th a t th ere will be m any in the office
M ost of m y patients a re going off
th e ir heads these days without m y
h elp 
He chuckled and H ale liked the
sound H ere he hoped w as a m an
who would open up B ut Doctor
D ew ars opening up w as cautious
Indeed alm ost at H ales first words
he changed from a rosy-faced and
som ew hat ex u berant m an-abouttow
n to a canny Scot with suspicious
eyes
 All 1 w ant D octor H ale began
briskly  is to put a hypothetical
c a se to you G ranting th at a c e rtain
doctor is doing so and so what
would be the penalty in your profession
1i he w ere caught a t it? 
 Youll have to be a lot m ors
definite than th a t my frien d  Doctor
D ew ar said curtly
 I expect to be H eres the hypothetical
situation A ssum e that
I m w riting a play around it and
need som e inform ation about the
ethics of the m edical profession in
such a c a s e 
 A h The doctor looked releved
but still cautious
H ale talked for ten m inutes At
the end Doctor D ew ar nodded slowly
 I ts a good situ atio n  he adm
itted  D ram atic and all that
I ts the so rt of thing th a ts m ore
apt to happen in life than in the
d ra m a  P lay w rig h ts a re afraid of
turning the screw too far Life is
never afraid of doing that I ts
doing it all the tim e  His caution
returned  You understand that
I c a n t be quoted in any way or
received and said he wouldnt Rex
w ent back to the bureau he had
visited th a t m orning He left for
fingerprinting th e slip of paper Ainsw
orth had given him in the m edical
lib ra ry  It had been luck to get
th at He also had his own fingerp
rin ts m sde
 I ve num bered all those prints
v ery carefu lly  he said  Be
m ighty careful about the num bers
in your reports M ark any later
specim ens 1 send you by consecutive
following figures E xpress yourself
in your w ritten rep o rts so a laym
an can understand you I ve got
a lot to learn about this sort of
thing
H ale next m ade his way to Casper
K neelands town house It was
a  brownstone fro n t on a street
ju st off the Avenue in the Sixties
and m uch like a dozen other brownstone
houses in its neighborhood
Who doesnt know the poor old g irl? 
even m entioned in connection with
a case of th a t so rt
 Given the conditions I ve suggested
w hat would be the procedure for
the ;nnocent bystan d er who is
w atching th e m ? 
 H -m -m m  It w as the doctors
tu rn to talk and he did it Hale
listened put questions m ade a few
notes At the end of tw enty m inutes
he got up and held out his hand
 T hanks he said gratefully
 Youve given m e ju st w hat I neede
d 
T he doctor retu rn ed the grip
H ale went aw ay optim istically He
w as still w alking in d ark places but
light w as breaking through and at
least he had one destination in sight
It w as fifteen m inutes past four He
called up the second psychiatrist
and had another break
The second p sy ch iatrist w as a differe
n t type from the first He was
im pressed by H ales letter from
Doctor K ingsbury the psychiatrist
and obviously proud of his brief
association w ith him H ale suspected
him of being a bit of a m edical
snob L ike D ew ar he attached much
im portance to K ingsburys assertion
th a t H ales discretion could be relied
upon A fter a little fencing the
two m en got down to b rass tacks
Yes Doctor Hitchcock knew Doctor
C raig Then all the unhelpful d ata
H ale had expectedÄîC raigs fine
training his m edical connections
and the like
 All th a t being g ran ted  Hale
asked D octor H itchcock  why isnt
he m ore popular? Why hasnt he
any frien d s?
H itchcock w as ready to answ er
that
 Hes too young for one thing
he pointed out  F or another hes
too self-centered Doesnt c a re for
friends He h a sn t tim e for them 
He considers his own tim e very
valuableÄîm uch m ore valuable than
som e of us think it is he smiled
 He has dropped hints th at hes on
the tra c k of som ething im portant
H es corresponding with som e bigwig
in V ienna but he doesnt say
who it is
 W hat about his c h a ra c te r as you
see it? 
 A m bitious Äî ra th e r abnorm ally
so R uthless I d say in going after
w hat he w ants T h ats all 1 know
about him  P a r t of th a t is theory
H ale w as satisfied He had put a
wholly different problem to Hitchcock
from the one presented to Dew
ar He had got w hat he w anted
from both He returned to the building
th a t held A insw orths office and
again interview ed the elevator ope
rato r No Mr Ainsw orth had not
been in the building th a t day The
op erato r didnt expect him He had
been th ere last T hursday He neve
r cam e m ore than once a week
these days and often he did n t show
up for two or th ree weeks
 When he does show up you wont
feel obliged to mention th a t a redheaded
chap has been asking questions
about him  will you?
The o perator grinned fingering
i the additional half dollar he had
H is ring a t the bell was answ ered
with deliberation by a middle-aged
colored m an neatly dressed and p rem
atu rely bald
 I m stopping here tonight Rex
said  Mr K neeland telephoned you
about it I suppose
 Yes suh
 H eres m y luggage said Hale
as he entered
He took from his pocket and held
out a comb a box of safety ra zors
a tooth brush and a sm all
cake of soap each article chastely
w rapped in cellophane He had ju st
purchased the collection in a corner
drug-store  My p lan Hp added
sedately  is to escape in a sheet
if the house catch es fire tonight
 If you-all will je st com e this
wayÄî The m an led him up the
staircase
 W hats your n a m e? Rex asked
as they went
 George Davis suh
 Well G eorge Davis there ar
those who like to w rap them selves
in silk p ajam as on a night like this
but I m not one of them  T heres
no one but you in the house Mr
Kneeland sa id 
 No suh
George w arm ed into hospitality
as he led the guest along an upper
hall
 M ist K neeland say you-all can
have anything you w ant he announced
throwing open a door
 All right than k s Hale said
gratefully  I ll take th at po rtrait
of Miss Jo a n on this wall I ts a
good one
They had entered a front bedroom
on the second floor Miss K neelands
p o rtrait painted by W aym an Adam
s faced them from a com m anding
position above the m antel
 Ah reckon G eorge suggested
thoughtfully  M ist K neeland he
m ean t bath-robes
 M aybe he did Whose room Is
th is? 
 I ts jest for com pny suh T h a ts
why Miss Jo an s pictures here
Miss Joan she don t like th a t pictu
re no-how
 T hat se ttles that Is this the
room youre putting me into? If it
is hustle along one of Mr Kneelands
d iscard ed bathrobes I m a
busy m an G eorge and the responsibilities
of life are pressing upon
me Step lively
G eorge returned dropped the
bath-robe over the foot of the bed
and tactfully retired
When Rex had bathed shaved and
re-dressed he was a giant refreshed
He had not quite decided
w hat to do w ith his evening Now
he suddenly resolved to dine a t
M axim s and see a cheerful play
T here w ere several good hold-overs
from the spring season
He carrie d out this program and
enjoyed it When he returned to
the Kneeland house a little after
eleven and sta rted upstairs he saw
a line of light under the door of a
room George had described as
 M ist K neelands lably S im ultaneously
the door opened and Kneeland
looked out
T hat you m y boy? he called
 Come in a m inute I hope G eorge
is m aking you com fortable he
added carelessly as Hale took the
chair he offered
 A ltogether too much so Hale
testified  I m getting to be a sybarite
I ought to be working with
a few m ule team s on the side of
som e A ndalusian m ountain to bring
m e back to n o rm al
Kneeland shook his head
 G rab everything you can get
while the grabbing is good he a d vised
 T h ats my motto T here
will be plenty of tim es when you
c a n t get w hat you w ant
A ll right s ir  Hale agreed
briskly  W hat I w ant now is to
ask you a few questions
 W hat kind of questions? If there
a re m any of them youd better light
up and have a drink before you begin
to shoot
 T here will be m any after that
lead  Hale said firm ly He helped
him self to a cig ar from the box
K neeland indicated
 W hat I w ant he said after the
two m en had lighted up  is your
authority to act for you at Halcyon
C am p in any serious em ergency
th a t m ay come up when youre not
th e re 
K neeland looked startled
 Are you expecting an em ergenc
y ? 
 I ts alw ays possible
 Well give me a line on it
 I c a n t do that s ir 
 Why not?
 B ecause to be frank I m afraid
you m ight spill the beans You
m ight see som ething and go off at
half-cock before the tim e was ripe
Since you have put m e in charge
of this investigation I feel justified
in asking you to give m e a free
h an d 
K neeland frowned and savagely
bit off the end of his cigar
 T h a ts a large o rd erÄîand 1 dont
like m y steries
 I know you dont sir T h a ts why
you asked m e to look into this one
 And Ihere is one? Youre sure
of th a t? 
 I m pretty sure of it But I
c a n t prove it unless the person
back of it gives him self aw ay

A S A proper approach to the perennial
spring sewing p rogram
th a t soon will be staged in countless
households we know of no gesture
th a t will so inspire to h u rry and
get going as to take a day off and
go fabric sight-seeing We m ake the
prediction th at at ju st a m ere
glim pse of the new textiles with
their refreshing d ep artu re from
the old in the way of texture patternings
and colorings you will feel
an urge stirrin g to cut and to baste
and to sew
In this day and age when wonders
a re being perform ed in the
way of tex tu res and w eaves it becom
es absolutely im perative that
the wom an who would sew successfully
m ust know m aterials This is
especially true in regard to wash
fabrics th a t a re a revelation as to
w hat science is achieving in the way
of non-shrinkage color-fast-boilproof
tones and tints and in the way
of w eaves of entirely new origin
Consider for exam ple the new spun
rayon fabrics th a t a re as lovely and
exquisite in texture as im agination
can conceive
When you ask to see these fascinating
new spun rayons take note
of their m arvelous colorings that
are so refreshingly different from
the usual run M any of the beautiful
hues and m otifs for design are
traced to fine Chinese porcelains
th a t excel in subtle soft blues and
can ary yellows lim e greens peachbloom
pinks and ch erry blossom
reds Youll love these new wash
fabrics th a t a re so handsom e they
really do not look like w ashables
but they a re and w h ats m ore they
are treated to an an ticrease process
th a t greatly enhances them from the
practical standpoint Some of the
sm a rtest w ashable crep es com bine
the new est fabric (spun rayon) with
one of the oldest (pure linen)
You can get these winsome spun
rayon crepes in delectable monotones
or in prints th at a re so lovely
m ere word pictures fail to describe
them  On your fabric sight-seeing
tour be on the lookout for prints that
stylize a flight of snow white birds
against a sky of peachbloom pink or
a seashell m otif on a lime green
background and you will thus sense |
the charm and beauty of the new
spun rayon crepes
Softer to the touch than all wool
yet cozier than cotton by far is an
im ported m aterial th a t looks like
and feels like a million yet it can
be sent to wash with a carefree
mind for the fabric has been sanforized-
shrunk See to the left in
the picture a housecoat m ade of this
new flannel (half wool half cotton)
which is lightweight as thistledown
This particu lar sm a rt plaid fabric
tailors to perfection
To the right in the illustration unusual
charm is expressed in a quaint
dirndl d ress of flowered cotton poplinÄî
one of the dependable m odern
cottons in th at it does not shrink out
of fit when washed It is trim m ed
with Czechoslovakian em broidery
and buttons in authentic Czech design
W ear it over shorts and cum m
erbund when en route to active
sports or as a full-tim e daytim e
dress E ither way it is perfect with
its m atching bonnet
You will find a bolero costum e
m ade of gingham (faithful standby)
m uch to your liking Why not enter
it on your sewing list for this twopiece
is easy to m ake so why not
look up a reliable pattern and have
it in readiness to w ear this spring
with dainty blouses? The model
centered in the group is in blue and
white check Thc sk irt is flared for
fullness The long-sleeved bolero
jack et has wide rªvers and exposes
cuffs of white pique caught with
large m other-of-pearl links M atching
gingham trim s the rough straw
sailor hat she has in her hand

Rural Traffic Accident Increase
Traffic accidents in the rural
d istricts a re mounting by leaps
and bounds Since 1924 the National
Safety council says m otor
vehicle fatalities have increased
172 per cent In cities over 10000
population they went up but 30
per cent
Of course the council points out
a large p a rt of this increase m ay
be the result of m uch-increased
ru ral travel But most traffic authorities
believe however th at
the m ore favorable city record
can be traced to the m ore effective
traffic control m easures in
m unicipalities
In 1937 the loss of life to traffic
accidents in rural districts and
cities under 10000 population w as
27400 In cities over 10000 there
w ere 12100 killed
While collisions with pedestrians
constituted the m ajor fatal accident
problem in cities ru ral distric
ts had their g reatest difficulty
with collisions between two o r
m ore m otor vehicles

A g en cy to H andle the Servant Problem
The dearth of Household servants
is as annoying in New Zealand as
it is ir B ritain so the women organizations
of the Dominion got together
and have suggested a rem edy
to the governm ent according
to the C hristchurch correspondent
of the O bserver of London
It is proposed to train a national
corps of dom estic w orkers to be
paid and hired out by the governm
ent E m ployers would reim burse
the governm ent according to their
m eans
A special com m ittee has been
form ed to look into the whole question
It is called the Household
Service cam paign com m ittee and
is rep resen tativ e of all the leading
wom ens organizations
The opinion is widely held among
New Zealand women th a t the status
of dom estic w orkers m ust be raised
considerably if a good supply of
efficient w orkers is to be m aintained
The com m ittee proposes th a t the

Farm and Home Week
For five days last week Wisconsin s
farm ers and homemakers who attended
the 36th annual Farm and Home
week combined business with pleasure
as they attended banquets stock
shows exhibits and meetings where
they heard experts and authorities
discuss dairying Most of the sta te ments
they heard from the experts
were of the kind that sent them home
happy
Among the pleasant things they
learned were:
1 That Wisconsins famous dairying
industry need have little fear of
competition from the south and
especially Louisiana because southern
farm ers turn from cotton to other
crops and pursuits only when they are
forced to The information came
from J W Bateman director of agri
cultural extension at Louisiana State
I niversity
2 Wisconsin leads other states in
the number of cooperative dairy en
terprises F F Hill governor of the
Farm Credit Administration explain
ed that there are 725 such associations
in the state which is more than
one fourth of the countrys total He
also said Wisconsin was second in the
number of purchasing and marketing
groups with 1145 associations
3 Fears that the Agricultural Ad
justm ent Administration will result in
 expansion of dairying in the corn and
cotton belts are unfounded That is
the opinion of R M Evans chief of
the AAA
Not so pleasant however was the
message of Prof Aldro Leopold of
the universitys agricultural economic
departm ent who said that government
is slowly but surely pushing northern
Wisconsin back into forests central
Wisconsin into m arsh scrub and
southern Wisconsin into a treeless
agricultural steppe He added that
the sta te s  soil bank is tottering
and asked for farm er cooperation in
conservation work
Big event of the week was the 20th
Little International livestock exhibition
and horse show Many of the
2500 convention visitors and Madison
residents who provided almost a capacity
crowd saw Governor Heil for the
tirst time when he officially crowned
Miss Edna Baumann Edgar as queen
f the exhibition University girls
from the home economics departm ent
took an active part in leading horses
and cattle in the show because 300 of
the short course boys who usually do
the leading were quarantined because
of several cases of scarlet fever

1 o n tr iltu tr il Hit S itd 
In May 1922 there was dedicated
in the city of W ashington the only
memorial of its kind in the United
States a massive building of white
marble a fitting climax of Americans
to honor the life and seivice of Lincoln
It stands in an open space on a
terraced mound rising to a total
height of 122 feet In the great interior
is a m ajestic statue of the
G reat Emancipator seated dwarfin?
all other objects there
Born 130 years ago on February 12
Lincoln is today called the savior of
whe Union and is esteemed one of the
nost exalted characters in American
listory Yet Abraham Lincoln began
ife in what was called a campÄîa
helter about 14 feet square without
i floor and made of poles So sketchy
was his education that when he wa
lectcd to Congress and was asked to
ive the facts of his life for the Directory
of Congress he dismissed his
arly years with two words Education
defective
Never has a man before or aftei
uen elected to ao high an office with
0 little actual experience in govern
nent as Lincoln Of him Wendell
Phillips asked Who is this huckstei
n politics? Who is this countrys
idvocate? Charles Francis Adams
vhom Lincoln appointed minister t
Jreat Britain said after Lincolns
leath that in the history of oui
government down to this hour no
Äxperiment so rash has ever been
nade as that of elevatingt to the head
f affairs a man with so little previous
(reparation for his task as Mr Linoln
No Preaident has ever taken
Äffice under less auspicious circumtances
When Lincoln went to
ÄVashington a plot to assassinate him
n Baltimore was foiled When he wa
worn into office the South had aleady
seceded ami the Civil War ha
egun
Yet Lincoln in spite of poverty
lostility and war kept his mind ot
he preservation of the Union at any
ost and on the ultim ate good for tht
United States of America He waibsolutely
non-partisan in performing
luties He was great because he was
1 true American and a real Christian
who -ought guidance from his Heavenly
Father in the great responsibilities
that rested upon him
One hundred and thirty years after
his humble birth we still celebrate
February 12th in our public schools
a a date when it is fitting to honor
the memory of one of our Great As
American citizens we would do well
to honor the democracy for which
Lincoln ultimately gave his life by
putting down in our own hearts any
feeling of racial prejudice or class
superiority We would do well to remember
the poverty and meanness of
the life from which our Iflth President
rose to the highest office any man can
attain in our land
A LITTLE VERSE
The following current rhyme was
handed to us for publication by Ed
Aanonsen:
You need your money
And I need mine
If we both get our money
It sure will be fine
But if you have your money
And you have mine too
What in the world am I going
to do ?

I T N BELIEV A BLE as it sounds to
 us today it was once the p ra c tice
of m en to wipe their noses on
th eir coatsleeves One day a king
on review ing his troops w as offended
at the sight and conceived the
idea of sew ing buttons on the sleeves
of his soldiers uniform s at the point
w here it w as lifted to the nose It
cured the soldiers of the practice
they developed the habit of carrying
nose cloths about with them and
the people of the kingdom took it
up H andkerchiefs were established
a s a hygienic necessity but the p ra c tice
of buttons on the sleeves was
never dropped

To our horror tbe chain was running wild
I on the m orning th a t the storm subsided the crew rigged an em ergency
gear and began to hoist them aboard
T h ats where Jim E v rard com es into the story Jim was a
radio operator but in a pinch aboard ship everybody turns to
and lends a hand And Jim w as sent down into the chain lockers
with a lad nam ed Piercy and another lad nam ed White to lay
anchor chain
1 guess th at sort of calls for a word of explanation The
chain lockers on the H atteras w ere a couple of room s eight feet
square ju st below deck up a t the bow of the ship They were
used of course to stow the anchor chains in while they w ere not
in use lp on the deck a big winch w as hauling in the starb o ard
anchor and as the chain cam e in it was passed through a hole
in the deck down into the chain locker
Well sir if th at chain w ere ju st allowed to lie in the locker any
way it landed it would tangle and sn a rl next tim e the anchor w as
! dropped It had to be laid in a neat coil as it cam e down and th a ts
w hat Jim  and Piercy and White w ere doing down there th at fateful
F eb ru ary day th at Old Lady A dventure had picked out to give three
sailors the sc are of their lives
A Choppy Sea M ade Footing Insecure
By th a t tim e all three of them w ere p retty tired The chain with
its big ten and a half inch links w as heavy The sea w as still choppy
m aking thei footing none too sure But they worked aw ay a t the port
! chain until the coil rose high in the locker Finally the chain stopped
coming in They could tell by the size of their coil th at the anchor w as
up and out of the w ater and ready to be heaved on deck
The three lads had stopped work and leaning each in a different
; corner of the cram ped locker bracing them selves against the pitching
and tossing of the ship
 We w ere waiting for ord ers to go back up on deck says
Jim   but the order w as slow in com ing Im agine our surprise
when we saw the anchor chain begin to pay out again It moved
slowly a t first and then quite rapidly A fter several seconds of
w atching it increased its speed we realized to our horror th a t the
chain was running wild!
And those lads had good reason to be horrified G reat loops
of heavy chain began whipping in long sw ings striking the sides
of the locker F aste r and faster it w ent and w ider and w ider were
the loops th at lashed out on all sides
 It w as swinging with terrific force says Jim   If it hit us it
would break our bones like c ard b o ard  or crush our skulls as if they
i w ere egg shells And there we stood not daring to move out of our cor-
| nersÄîw ondering when the flying m esh of steel w as going to whip in
after us- wondering when a chance lurch of the ship was going to throw
us off balance out into the path of th a t w hirling m ass of m etal
The Noise of the Links Was Like a D eath K nell
 The din w as terrific O ur prison w as sm all and we could feel the
wind on our faces as the chain flew by In w ider and wider a rc s it swung
i The links as they hit the w alls sounded like the beats of a death knell
i to all of us I wanted to faint but I didnt d are Pow erless to do anything
a t all I kept m y m ind on the one thing that m ight save m eÄî
standing right w here I was in the sc a n t protection the corner of the room
afforded m e
Loop after loop whipped its way around the little locker and
spun on up through the hole in the top Only a few m ore of those
loops to go now Then th ey d all be safe Jim w atched those
last few loops go and breathed a p ray er of thanksgiving They
W EEK safe Over in th eir own corners stood White and P iercy
chalky-faced but unhurt Then they called to the officers up on
deck who by that tim e doubted if any of them were alive
The cause of the trouble they had found had been Old Man Neptune
himself A roll of the ship had throw n over the anchor chock and another
roll had caused the engineer to slip and throw the anchor winch
| out of gear
 The anchor had to be raised a g ain  says Jim   but we w eren t sent
down to lay the cham  The next throe m en hod better luck than we did

into the im penetrable wall of
the Rocky m ountains T here w as
an Indian legend th at there was a
pass over the divide along the
course of the M arias river Mr
Stevens a young engineer for the
railroad talked to the B lackfeet
about it T here w as such a pass j
They knew all about it But not all

them even to point in th a t direction
T his M arias pass w as the
dwelling place of evil spirits of
sorcerers of dreadful dem ons and
all who went th at way lost either
their lives or their reason
Mr Stevens m ushed over the

found no pass But by chance
he found a w anderer in the wilderness

To help her children m a in tain
top health and vitality a
m o th er m ust constantly be
a le rt to the various facto rs
th a t help produce this ideal
esta te  And a t the sam e tim e
she m ust likewise be on g uard
a g a in st the com m on conditions
th a t m ay contribute to
low ered resistance especially
fatigue and im proper diet
W inter Hazards
It has been said th at in w inter
the body is on tria lÄîand this is
as tru e of children
as of adults E xtrem
es of te m p e ra ture
require a d justm
ents on the
part of the body
and in m ost p arts
of the country
children a re called
upon constantly to
switch th eir environm
ent from a
house which is all
too frequently overheated
to an outdoor tem p eratu re
th a t m ay be below freezing
While cool outdoor a ir is stim ulating
to children in norm al
health som e children w ithstand
it m uch less successfully T his is
p a rticu larly true of those who are
im properly nourished; who are
over-fatigued or sufTer from poor
circulation
When it is very cold outdoors it
is wise to have children com e in
from th eir play periodically to
w arm up And if a child ap p ears
to suffer from the cold unduly it
is wise to have a physician check
up on his health
of active play Suitable clothing
consists of garm en ts which provide
w arm th and protection
against dam pness without constriction
at any point
Two lay ers of wool such as
th at provided by a woolen sw eate
r and playsuit are considered
preferable to one too-bulky gar
m ent Feet and hands should of
course be well protected
G uard Against Frostbite
Over-exposure m ust be avoided
; particularly in cold dam p w eather
F o r under these conditions
doctors w arn there is alw ays a
danger of frostbite They iay that
w henever the tem p eratu re falls
below 8 degrees F ahrenheit children
should not be perm itted to
play outdoors If they do the cold
m ay act upon the tissues so that
p a rt of the body is deprived of its
blood supply This is m ost likely
| to occur in the fingers toes nose
or ears which thereupon become
frozen The com bination of wind
and low tem p eratu re is especially
dangerous and frostbite frequently
occurs at te m p eratu res up to 14
degrees Fahrenheit when th ere is
a strong wind
M others should be on guard
; against frostbite when the temj
p e ra tu re is below 24 degrees Fahrj
enheit however and at all tim es
| during the w inter see th a t chil-
I d ren a re w arm ly clad This need
not m ean th a t they are so bundled
j up as to preclude the possibility
Dont O verheat the House
Only a little less serious ore
the consequences of dry overheated
indoor air It is unfortunate
th at so m any people keep
their room s entirely too w arm in
winter T his not only widens the
gap betw een indoor and outdoor
tem p eratu res but m ay be extrem
ely irritatin g to the delicate
m em branes of the nose and
throat Most authorities consider
an indoor tem p e ra tu re of about 68
degrees F ah renheit satisfactory
Is Your Child Lazy?
We often h ear m others complain
th at th eir children are lazy in
cold w eather    and they seem
to have less pep and energy than
in other seasons If by th a t they
m ean th a t their children are
less active it m ay be th at this
can be attributed in p a rt to the
bleak sh o rter days th a t do not always
invite outdoor play But
som etim es a child displays such
a reduction in his activities as to
a p p ear indolent Then the m othe
r m ust seek the physical or em otional
factors th a t m ay be responsible
For tru e laziness suggests
a body th a t is not functioning
norm ally
Q uite possibly the ch ilds diet is
not m eeting his bodily req u irem
ents An undernourished child
usually tire s easily and is disinclined
to ex ert him self The
food m ay be adequate as to quantity
but not as to quality For
exam ple a diet th at is too highly
concentrated contains too little
bulk or cellulose m ay cause a
tendency to faulty elim ination
This in turn is frequently responsible
for lassitude The rem edy
is often a sim ple d ietary
changeÄîthe addition of a salad to
the daily diet; or possibly the
use of stewed dried fruits in addition
to a fresh fruit or fruit juice
daily Of course the child should
also have two servings of vegetables
besides potatoes one of
which should be of the green
leafy variety Also a q u a rt of milk
daily; breads and cereals at least
half of which m ay preferably be
the whole grain v ariety ; an egg
daily or at least three or four
w eekly; one serving of m eat fish
or chicken and another serving
of a protein food such as cheese
Som e form of vitam in D should
be included in the diet of young
children especially (luring the
w inter m onths
It is also m ost im portant th a t
children follow a daily routine th a t
includes plenty of tim e for sleep
And for younger children a daytim
e nap is usually advised
