    enlightenment upon the many significant and crucial issues that now affect
    our daily life Every community is seeking to bring to it competent
    wellinformed leaders who can lead a forum or town meeting upon these
    contemporary questions In order to assist this community to provide its
    thinking people with an authoritative discussion of the problems of the
    present day the University Extension Division is sending here Manford H Kuhn
    who will discuss those contemporary crucial issues that are uppermost in the
    minds of the citizens The exact subjects for discussion will be largely
    determined by the wishes of those attending the course Mr Kuhn will choose
    the subjects for the first one or two evenings in order to give his
    background for the discussions to follow Following are a few of the various
    topics from which his audience may choose the material for the rest of the
    course 1 The Neutrality law and new proposals now before Congress How to
    Keep Out of Europe s War 2 Preparedness does it or does it not keep the

    umbrellas That evening they were pleasantly asked and pleasantly forced to
    push onions all the way across the gym floor with their noses regardless of
    the steaming tears (alligator tears) The best joke ( ) of the evening was
    seeing Mr Osborne spread a handkerchief in front of Miss Hickcox to propose
    to her Boogie Fullington also proposed to Miss Ormson Both of the young
    ladies accepted and as Miss Hickcox reported it was going to be a double
    wedding soon! In case the Freshmen had become a little bit exhausted after

    nourishment was given It consisted of macaroni mustard nutmeg black pepper
    salt water sugar and cinnamon A fterwards a lunch of cup cakes was served

    ookkeeper M ERLIN H U LL S LE TTE R The Senate will spend four or five weeks
    in debating the president s substitute for the present neutrality law It is
    believed that it may conclude the argument and vote on the bill before
    November 1st Then the measure will come back to the House where under the
    rules only one hour will be given to debate no matter how many and how
    anxious members may be to put in an amendment or discuss the matter It is
    likely that a new rule will be brought in granting more time Some of the
    leaders advise that the 435 members in the House should have at least a day
    to say what they want to But when the bill comes back from the Senate there
    will be no opportunity for House amendments The parliamentary situation is
    largely under control of the administration leaders in both houses The bill
    before the Senate will come up as an amendment to the Bloom bill passed by
    the House last session If it is passed by the Senate as it seems likely it
    will be when it comes to the House the latter body will have only two moves
    possible One will be to accept the amendments o f the Senate The other will
    be to send the bill to conference a committee of both senators and
    representatives with the right to instruct the House conferees how they
    shall vote on each Senate amendment Free speech on raising the munitions
    embargo and other features of the new bill will therefore be very largely
    confined to the Senate unless the House leaders backed by 90 majority of the
    membership shall permit a more liberal rule to be brought in One of the
    watchwords of the hour in the national capital is to Beware of Propaganda
    The warning to the public is repeated daily over the radio and in the press
    All news from the warring countries is said to be censored and controlled so
    that nobody knows exactly what is so and what is not At the same time it is
    said that our own Department o f State has most complete information from
    abroad as to what actually is transpiring Its information bureau is said to
    have known in June that war surely would come The damage done by foreign
    propaganda is to the judgments formed by the people from misleading
    statements and so called news Perhaps it would be in violation of
    International law and contrary to the ethics of diplomacy for our Department
    of State to counteract the propaganda from over seas by making frequent
    statements to the public as to what facts there are obtainable in all the
    countries The best antidote for false reports is the truth In the English
    parliament the ministers speak frequently giving plain statements as to what
    is going on upon any question of war or peace Our own policy has seemed to
    be more secretive and people are left to form their opinions upon such
    information as they can pick up Although the war is 3 000 miles away and
    nearly everybody wants to keep it there and neither have it come nearer nor
    have our people get any closer to it there is an atmosphere in Washington
    which may cause wonderment on the part of those who follow the news
    intensely The White House has been closed to visitors and guards in the
    mansion and about the grounds warn away the thousands of visitors who come
    daily to see all the sights of the capital city A letter from a senator or
    congressman to a White House secretary is no longer a pass for visitors
    seeking to go through the rooms ordinarily open to the public The big
    capital through whose corridors thousands of visitors pass daily has now
    been closed to Sunday visitors On Sundays the multitude comes from all
    sections to visit the historic building Now such visitors must come on week
    days or merely look on from the outside The reason assigned is that once
    upon a time twenty years ago a demented Sunday visitor left a valise in a
    capital corridor and a few hours later it exploded doing considerable damage
    to the corridor scenery The same man went on to New York where he tried to
    kill J Pierpont Morgan So to provent a recurrence of such an explosion in
    the capitol it is closed to visitors Just why there is more risk on Sundays
    than on any other day of the week is not so plain But as yet there is no
    information that J Pierpont Morgan is being locked up on Sunday for
    protection The conference of the nations of North America and South America
    at Panama is discussing methods o f establishing a safety zone about both
    continents into which the naval vessels and air planes of belligerent
    nations must not enter Our navy will do the most of the patrolling in case
    the plan goes through Numerous other questions relating to the war are under
    consideration Along with the conference in its laudable purpose to keep out
    of the European conflagration is the move to improve trade relations between
    our own and the South American countries The latter are in a mood to
    negotiate providing of course our treasury shall spill a few more millions
    in their direction to facilitate the trading The latest request is that the
    Export bank shall liberate $75 000 000 of additional credit to those
    countries on top of about $51 000 000 to Brazil and ten or twelve million
    more to other countries a few weeks ago Up to date over a billion dollars of
    our money has gone to grease trade relations with South America in the past
    twenty years the most of it to American industries whose officials would not
    trust those foreign buyers for more than $10 at a time But the losses on the
    loans amount to about 75 per cent Building foreign trade with loans is not a
    new scheme but experience has proved that it is expensive The staggering
    costs of war are apparent in the first published statement as to what
    England is spending The war as yet only fairly started is costing that
    country $26 000 000 per day or over $1 000 000 per hour A t that rate in
    twelve months the MRS O B M ARSH ALL Mrs O B Marshall passed away at her
    home in Neillsville Thursday Sept 28 1939 following a long illness Funeral

    Marshall homestead near North Bend In 1928 they purchased a home in Melrose
    where they lived for seven years and then moved to Neillsville where they
    lived until she was taken away Mrs Marshall was deeply devoted to her
    husband home and children She belonged to the Presbyterian church the
    Rebekkah order and the Ladies Aid at North Bend She was a kind lovable woman
    and will be sadly missed in her home and among her friends and relatives The
    sympathy of all goes to her husband and children EV A N G E L IC A L LU TH

    f War MERLIN HULL M ILLERS U NEARN ED RUN NOSES OUT M ERCH ANTS 1 TO 0 There
    are times in one s existence when he dreams of doing a great deed A deed so
    sensational in essence as to draw gasps of amazement and of unbelief from an
    admiring throng A deed so great that the spine of the witness virtually
    tingles in response to what his eyes behold But while one dreams of such an
    experience quite often the mortal who plays the part of such a hero is rare
    indeed Always the hero must perform the unbelievable The thing that couldn t
    be done Well some odd thousand people witnessed just such a spectacle at the
    Jackson county fair grounds last Sunday afternoon and when they wended their
    way homeward after seeing the nine local heroes fight through an hour and a
    half and nine innings of the impossible the tributes from their lips fell
    like raindrops in a clourburst It couldn t be done but the Black River Falls
    Merchants led by a pint sized package of dynamite labeled Ernie Rudolph not
    only gave the great Minneapolis Millers a run for their money but actually
    put on a better show than the runners up to the pennant winners of the
    American Association The Millers of course won the ball game with their
    unearned 8th inning run but only after playing as great a game as has been
    uncorked in their own league all season And the tributes came not alone from
    the fans but from the Millers themselves and those boys don t pass out any
    pats on the back to yokels If Ernie Rudolph ever pitches a greater ball game
    than he did last Sunday afternoon we want to see it He held the hard hitting
    Millers to only five hits one of which was a double by his pitching opponent
    Herb Hash No two of these hits came in the same chapter And when the
    faintest kind of a threat appeared Ernie rubbed it out with the greatest of
    ease except in the unfortunate 8th when the lonely and tainted run came home
    following a slip up on a double play ball Had that play been perfectly
    executed Hash might not have finished the game in time to start the season
    with the Red Sox next spring No one will deny that Hash is a great pitcher
    he probably will be with the Boston Red Sox for many years He s not only a
    top flight pitcher but as nice a fellow as you would care to meet The same
    applies to nearly every player in their position on the Minneapolis Club We
    had the pleasure of talking to several of the boys on the visiting team and
    the only conclusion we could draw was that they were the finest bunch of
    ball players we have had here for a long long time Not only that but they
    enjoyed their visit in Black River Falls so well that they want to come back
    here for another game during the regular A A season next year When they do
    return they will be accorded the same hospitality and the same kind of a
    baseball game as they received on this trip It s something Black River is
    rapidly becoming noted for hospitality and baseball Ernie the refuge from
    big league pitching fame was not the only shining light on the great
    Merchants team Sunday afternoon in fact you would have to read from the top
    to the bottom of the local lineup to get them all This boy of Oscar Teeples
    wasn t exactly a slouch and was the only ball player on the field who
    managed to get more than a single hit during the contest Bob got a pair o f
    singles off Hash beside laying down a perfect bunt which put the Merchants
    in a fine way to win the ball game Bob also handled a number o f chances in
    the field which were on the brink of the sensational Kleven the old reliable
    in center field didn t do so badly either handling four hard chances with
    efficiency and grace Even Whittet who all season long has sent a parade of
    runs from third to home and done an excellent job with a minimum of errors
    was in top form on the potential plate customers that got to his station
    Come to think of it throughout the season there has not been an instance of
    confusion while Glenn has held his coaching spot Even your Oracle was in top
    form in this last battle having publicly predicted a sizzling hot battle and
    doing so amid a lifting of eyebrows But now we can say I told you so Now to
    the game play by play First Inning Millers Faucett grounded to Teep les and
    Pofahl followed suit Rudolph struck out Wasdell Merchants Hash threw out
    Randles He also tossed out Kleven Teeples whiffed Second Inning Millers
    Wright was at first on an error at short Storti lined to Kleven Wright was
    erased at second on Denning s grounder to Cihosz Phleger lined a hit to
    center Denning moving to second Denning was touched on the baseline by
    Cihosz after the latter had gobbled up Lacey s bounder Merchants Cihosz shot
    a terrific 2 baser along the base line to left A Rudolph flied to left
    Cihosz moved to 3rd while Hoard was being retired Faucett to Wasdell Hauser
    was set down on strikes Third Inning Millers Hash popped to A Rudolph and
    Faucett popped to Cihosz Pofahl coaxed a pass Wasdell skied to Hauser
    Merchants Neidfeldt was thrown out by Storti Denning made a nice play to
    capture E Rudolph s liner to left Randles was retired on strikes Fourth
    Inning Millers Wright beat out a slow bounding hit to Teeples Storti went
    down on a pop to Cihosz Denning hit into a double play A Rudolph to Teeples
    to Hauser Merchants Storti took Kleven s pop up Teeples drove a line single
    to left but was sunk stealing Lacey to Pofahl Cihosz wound up the chapter
    with a third strike Fifth Inning Millers A Rudolph threw out Phleger Lacey
    fanned Hash shot a double to center Faucett popped to Teeples Merchants A
    Rudolph shot a hit to center Hoard watched a third strike go by Hoard forced
    A Rudolph Storti to Pofahl Neidfeldt fanned Sixth Inning Millers Pofahl was
    out on a fly to Kleven Randles took in Wasdell s sky ball Hoard threw out
    Wright Merchants Randles dropped a hit in left Kleven beat out a high
    bounder over Hash s head Both of these hits came after E Rudolph had popped
    to Faucett Teeples laid down a perfect bunt moving Randles and Kleven to
    third and second Hash raised the distress signal when Cihosz came to bat and
    wanting no part o f the big fellow disposed of him with an intentional pass
    Storti went to his left to get A Rudolph s ground ball and threw Art out to
    end the uprising Seventh Inning Millers E Rudolph threw out Storti Denning
    was out Cihosz to Hauser Phleger drew a line on A Rudolph s miscue Lacey
    shot a hit to left Pfleger going to second Rudolph struck out Hash Merchants
    Hash struck out the side the side being Hoard Hauser and Neidfeldt Eighth
    Inning Millers Faucett lined a hit between Kleven and Neidfeldt Pofahl tried
    to sacrifice and was out on a tiny pop to Ernie Wasdell grounded to Teeples
    but was safe when Teeples held Faucett who had stolen second to a single
    base on the play Faucett scored the only run of the ball game when a fast
    double play missed fire on a low throw to Hauser from A Rudolph who had sunk
    Wasdell at second Wright was out stealing Hoard to Teeples Merchants Pofahl
    threw out E Rudolph Hash threw out both Randles and Kleven Ninth Inning
    Millers Storti was disposed of on a fly to Randles Denning went out to
    Hauser unassisted Kleven took Phlefer s fly Merchants Teeples beat out a hit
    to Faucett Cihosz whiffed A Rudolph flied to Denning Teeples was out when he
    didn t get back to first on the play and was doubled Denning to Wasdell TH

    Raymond J Kelly an attorney of Detroit Mich Kelly matriculated at the First
    Officers Training Camp at Ft Sheridan in 1917 was recommended for a
    commission but suffered an injury which caused his discharge from the
    service on a surgeon s certificate of disability He immediately entered a
    hospital went through an operation recovered and then enlisted as a private

    Corwith Rockville Centre New York was chosen National President of the
    Auxiliary Is a Charter Member of the Rockville Centre unit In accepting his
    election Commander Kelly pledged himself to carry out the convention s
    mandate for keeping America out of war The American Legion says that the
    security and salvation of America transcend all other considerations Kelly
    stated while the delegates shouted their approval Now as never before we
    must save our youth from being dumped into the bubbling cauldron of old
    world poisons Gen Hugh S Johnson of former NRA fame addressed the delegates
    and kept them in an uproar with his army line and wise cracks He opened by
    greeting his comrades You ex makers of the world safe for democracy you ex
    warriors to end wars He scored those who feel that we cannot stay out of war
    and urged that the United States make itself strong enough to stand alone
    and thereby save its democracy He closed by saying We thought we were
    fighting for international decency now look at th e d a mn ed thing!
    Meanwhile Mr Grover Cleveland Bergdoll makes his daily trips from the Tombs
    to Uncle Sam s Court Martial But he never travels alone he is handcuffed to
    the strong arm o f a regular army sergeant On one of these trips the
    sergeant and other soldiers of the party stopped to salute the colors as
    they were being lowered during retreat Mr B being shackled to the r a s also
    came to a halt one might say by request But he did not salute whether or not
    he had the proper urge as his right was hooked to the r a s left ing At this
    moment chanced to pass a certain newspaper photographer He jumped at this
    plum and straightaway saw that it was run in all the metropolitan newspapers
    Looking at which causes one to reflect that Mr Edward Everett Hale once
    wrote a book entitled The man without a country which volume might make a
