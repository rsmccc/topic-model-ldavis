Jackson county s first 4 H Club
bull calf sale was a success Sale records
show total sale receipts of
$2855 50 for the 28 calves or an average
of $101 98 per calf 
Much credit must be given to the
28 4 H club member who were willing
to take a chance on receiving a small
margin of profit after deducting the
original purchase price and the cost
of the feed fed during the ten or
more months of ownership It is not
necessary to mention the fact that
the calves received the best of care
because the prices received is the
best proof of their general condition 
We do not wish to imply that the
price received is entirely due to the
care given the calves No doubt some
of the boys were a little more lucky
than others in that their calves showed
a natural tendency to develop into
a better animal 
The crowd of prospective buyers
and interested spectators started arriving
soon after the calves were placed
in line in the County Shop Simplified
outlines of each pedigree was
given a card placed over each calf to
give every one an opportunity to
check the pedigree when the calf was
in view We were glad to see that
many prospective buyers were present
from neighboring counties since
a little competition always helps to
guarantee better prices A crowd of
between two and three hundred people
remained at the sale during the
entire afternoon

Merlin Hull was among the members
of Congress who appeared before
the Tariff Commission at Washington
to strenuously oppose the negotiation
of the proposed trade treaty
with Argentine The following
excerpts from his argument were included
in a press dispatch from Washington
 
 The farmers of Wisconsin and the
middle west have every reason to feel
apprehensive as to the proposed new
trade treaty with Argentine Suffering
now of the added competition in
our home markets by trade agreements
which have served to increase
importations increase surpluses and
lower prices the threat of this added
competition from a land of much
cheaper production costs is serious 
 The proposed reductions in tariff
rates on Argentine farm products will
apply to cheese casein turkeys canned
or pickled beef products flax 
wool and numerous other products 
on which the tariff duties are now
too low Reducing them further will
swell importations In fact the object
of the new treaty will be to increase
the importations Either the
treaty must fail of its purpose or the
mid western farmers must suffer the
consequences of its success 
 Coming at a time when farm
foreclosures are at the peak and thousands
of farmers are losing their
home and all it is an added burden 
Reducing the tariff on dairy products 
for instance as our own government
is expending fifty millions of
dollars to reduce the surplus dairy
products by furnishing them free to
thousands of people on relief makes
for a contradictory governmental policy
which borders upon absurdity 
 Coming at a time when meat
prices are falling and a surplus is
threatened with lower prices to all
farmers a reduction of tariff rates
on meat products adds to the already
ruinous competition of cattle from
Canada and Mexico from which countries
424 000 head of cattle were imported
in the first six months of this
year 
 Turkey raisers also have reason to
fear the effect of the reduced rates
on turkeys Our own production will
be 22 per cent larger this year than
in 1938 Argentine turkeys are fattened
on 20 cent corn and reach our
eastern cities at an ocean rate much
cheaper than rail transportation on
the turkeys from the mid west 
 There is no country in the world
whose agriculture threatens that of
our middle west like Argentine It
has over 200 000 000 acres of rich
land lying close to ocean transportation 
all capable of production as
prolific as that of the rich soils of
Iowa and Illinois That area is equal
to that of all the farms of Iowa 
Illinois Missouri Wisconsin Minnesota 
and North and South Dakota 
 Production costs are lower than in
any country in North America and
Europe Farm hands receive from
$7 to $15 per month without board 
Farms are larger ranging from 10 
000 to 50 000 acres owned by land
barons who thrive on the miserable
wages of their farm people It is a
newer country with great fertility
of soils and volume of production far
exceeds that of our own farms As
yet only one fourth its broad acres
are under cultivation The trade
treaty would aid in its more rapid
development to the destruction of
our own agriculture 
 Trade treaties are a form of freetrade
on the installment plan to further
the interest of great industries
at the sacrifice of agriculture Argentine
imported from us last year 
products to the amount of $86 000 
000 To increase that trade it is
proposed to barter away the home
markets of our own farmers Last
year the farmers of Wisconsin purchased
commodities of our own country
in excess of $200 000 000 It is
the purpose of the treaty to reduce
that buying power by permitting the
land barons of Argentine to have a
larger share in our home markets It
is a stealthy cowardly policy of selling
out our own farmers to benefit
those of other lands Congress should
and eventually will repeal the law
which permits this assault upon the
just rights of our own agriculture

The long arm of coincidence hover
ed over Highway Commissioner O H 
Overlien on a recent morning He
had driven in from his home and
parked across the street from the east
entrance to the court house and his
office and right in front of the Lutheran
church He had turned on his
radio and was listening to it absent
mindedly when his attention snapped
to attention by the announcement of
Hymn 447 at the request of Rev A 
M Romstad for Miss Caroline Overlien 
Miss Overlien is his sister and
she had not been well for a time
past Rev Romstad is pastor of the
church in front of which he was parked 
Just then to carry out the coincidence 
the near editor of the local
paper came along en route to the
office and sat in the car to hear the
end of the program The rest 5f the
story is more of an incident than coincident 
The near editor on arriving
at the office a few moments later
called Rev Romstad with the intention
of asking the name of Hymn
447 When a man s voice answered
she asked What is the name of
Hymn 447 She twice repeated the
inquiry which apparently wasn t
clicking at the other end of the
phone and then it dawned on her
low grade intelligence that she had
the wrong number She apologized
stating that she thought she had Rev 
Romstad to which there was a warm
reply Good far from it the
click of a receiver and a busy man
went on about his Saturday s work 
The hymn was Just As I Am Without
One Plea and it came from St 
Olaf s broadcasting station The
thought of it gave Miss Overlien
much pleasure

L O C A L G R A P P L E R S W IN
The manly if not gentle art of
wrestling invaded the fair city of
Black River Falls last Friday night
and the Old Fox Theatre heard more
groans than the Krohn clinic and
more grunts than a Winnebago encampment 
About 300 people were
present to see the big boys try to
throw each other for losses and every
one of em said they had lots of fun 
especially since they didn t have to do
the wrestling themselves Of course
everybody went away happy and all
of the folks now that they have
smelled blood and the odor of resin 
want to go back and see the show
come Friday again Some of the best
grunters in the business have been
lined up for Friday Nov 3 More of
which later 
Earl Overlien the carrot topped
concrete mixer and the pride of the
city of Black River Falls engaged an
animated and alpine gentlemen who
in size and weight constitutes about
50 of the town of North Bend 
from whence he Mr Blaken originates 
Earl earned himself a reputation
as a mountain climber by pinning
the ample Blaken in a few seconds
over nine minutes on what is
known to the trade as a body press 
a gesture which consists of pinning
the shoulders of the opposing hulk
right smack down on the canvas 
The fact that Earl put so much man
down in such a short time predicts big
things for the powerful local lad 
Much is expected from the red thatched
youth in his future engagements 
In the semi windup affair Silent
Tarzan Krause the man who neither
speaks nor Hears lost a three fall
set to to a gent bearing the name of
Scotty Williams Krause won the
first fall by using an Indian death
lock a hold used by our redskin
breathren long ago Despite the success
our dusky cousins enjoyed from
the use of this little trick it didn t
work so good for the Silent Krause
because Williams came back 13 minutes
later to pin his opponent with a
body press and then Williams won the
match 
Lou Mueller won 2 falls out of 3
from Tex Hager This tussle was
really high class stuff both boys being
rated as contenders for the crown
in their weight division Lou has
also tutored Overlien in finer points
of the game thus gained his way into
high standing among local sports lovers 
It took Lou 35 min to snap a
double toe hold on Hager but once
applied the man from Texas was not
long in seeing the advantage of comfort
over honor and spake uncle 
Once up Hager evidently mistook
Mueller for a football and started a
whole series of drop kicks which were
both interesting and effective Tex
finally tackled Lou and threw him for
a loss as well as a fall winding up
the foot work with a body press to
even the fray at a fall each Eleven
minutes later Lou came back with a
reverse crab hold and was about to
break off one of Hager s very kicky
lower limbs but before Mr Mueller
could get it loose from its moorings
the rough footballer saw the disadvantage
of being dismembered and
conceded the fall and the argument 
It seems that local folks nave gone
for the new entertainment in a big
way and everybody says they ll be
back again for the bouts on Friday 
Nov 3 The card lined up for this
date also marks the debut of Overlien
into the realm of the elite in the profession 
Earl will try holds with Tex
Hager the mean guy who thinks people
and pigskins are synonymous 
Earl s chances to win are rated about
even he having had a lot of special
instruction from Mueller who is giving
the local lad the low down on the
holds for which Hager is a sucker 
Overlien s weight is 200 Hager s 185 
In the second match of the evening
Scotty Williams who won over
Krause here last Friday will meet
 Sugi Hayamaki of Kobi Japan Hayamaki
is a highly scientific wrestler
who is also very adept at the fascinating
art of Jiujitsu 
The windup should be a humdinger 
Mueller of Black River Falls vs
Steve Nenoff the scourge of Bulgaria 
professed to be the meanest
man in the business Nearly all of
the maneuvers of the Bulgarian are
just on the line permitted by the rules
or just over it Due to his technique
most of the grapplers fear him and
avoid getting into the ring with him 
Mueller not only has no fear of him
but feels that he will emerge from
the match not only intact physically
but a step nearer the wrestling
crown SNOOSE

Last month they took a trip they had
been planning and thinking about for
a long time Loading a trailer with a
canoe and camping equipment they
drove to Black River Falls There
they put the canoe in the Black and
for four days made their way slowly
and leisurely downstream to McGilvray

The trip was made without a mishap
although they did portage around
one spot of rapids They camped and
fished along the way The distance
covered by the wrater route was about
50 miles Altogether it was a delightful
outing Galesville Republi

it s HARD to tell but EASY to pick a winning oil
THE hand is quicker than the eye says this
breezy boy and he challenges all comers to
guess at suitable odds which shell hides the
little pea No matter how closely you watch him 
as he deftly lifts and maneuvers the shells the
pea never seems to be under the one you pick 
But you never have to engage in a
contest of wits you don t have to
guess which is a winning oil for
your motor It s easy to tell This is why 
The great Phillips refining organization
makes a complete and frank statement
which does away with all doubt No hedging 
no reservations If you want our best
oil remember we specify that Phillips 66
Motor Oil is our finest quality the

short shots etc

hard to make a good team As

Last Monday we ordered our announcements
from a salesman who
was sent down by C J Johnson He
had a large variety of announcements
and cards for us to make our choice
from and of course we think we
chose the best he had We have the
assurance that no other school within
a 50 mile radius will have the same
ones We wish to thank Mr Johnson
for sending him down 
The Seniors are expecting you all
to the dance this Friday night Nov 
3 in the High school gymnasium 
Miss Hickcox has assigned us a
theme to be due every Thursday Our
topic for last week was our Most
Thrilling Moment For this coming
Thursday we have our choice of a
few subjects 
In the Social Problems class quite
a few informal debates are always
showing up Last week we were discussing
which is the most basic fire
or writing At first only about two
students were taking the stand for
fire as being the most basic but at
the end of the class period the following
day they had won all but one
over to their side Now the discussion
is if walking is a habit or not 
We know that it is a necessity and
that ways of walking are habits but
is walking itself a habit 
S O P H O M O R E S
They say that we are the deadest
class in high school so ! But we
do have a few boys who like to walk
to Alma Center occasionally A couple
of girls are energetic enough to
use their brain power to get 97 in
Biology and that s not as simple as it
looks

Friends of the Reformed Church at
Humbird will be interested in the
following story about it which appeared
last week in the Clark County
Press 
Driving through Humbird on No 
12 one sees a cement block church
high up on the mound to the east It
is a seemly structure evidently built
to resist fire From its vantage point
it overlooks rolling meadows and
wooded hills It is the place of worship
of St John s Reformed church
of Humbird 
If the location is a vantage point
from the standpoint of the view it
is a hazard from the viewpoint of
fire Six years ago the mound was
swept by fire The danger is constant 
So the people of the church
used material which cannot be burned 
It would be a conflagration indeed 
which could set this building on
fire 
The interior of this church is neat
and well planned as suitable as the
exterior is attractive The auditorium
is large and well furnished In
a section where there are many
Catholic and Lutheran churches the
Church Tramp noted the absence of
altar The Reformed people take
their worship plain The minister
stands behind a pulpit He is without
vestment He does not turn his
back to the audience and his face to
the altar That exaltation of the altar
is conspicuous by its absence 
The basement is well arranged for
Sunday school classes and social affairs 
It is one large room except
for the furnace room The quarters
are ample for the congregation 
Entering this church last Sunday 
the Church Tramp noted the tendency
for the men to occupy one side of the
church the right The women were
at the left The line was not drawn
hard and fast But as often in congregations
of Clark county the tendency
was pronounced And as in
many of present day churches the
women were decidedly in the majority 
I f the Church Tramp counted
right there were 22 women 12 men
and three children Quite likely this
was not a typical attendance but the
proportion of women was quite typical
of most Protestant church except
perhaps the Lutheran The small proportion
of children was also typical 
Most of the Protestant churches have
drifted consciously or subconsciously 
into acceptance of a situation in
which the children attend Sunday
school (if they do) and not church 
The location of this Reformed
church well up on the side of a
mound has its disadvantages Those
who attend it must climb and the
climb is not easy in cold weather Not
long ago the congregation put up a
railing from the bottom of the slope
and along the concrete walk leading
to the church door That railing
shines with new aluminum paint and
suggests a welcome support for the
slippery weather to come Young and
old may grasp its welcome support 
The railing runs from pole to pole 
upon which electric lights shine Thus
the ascent is made as easy as possible 
and bright at night 
For funerals there is an ascent to
the back of the church up the side
of the mound This may also be used
at other times but the parking space
at the rear of the church is not large
and the custom of the congregation
is to park at the foot of the hill in
front of the manse and below 
The pastor of this church on the
mound is the Rev V D Weidler who
has presided over the congregation
since 1930 Mr Weidler is a graduate
of Mission House college at Plymouth 
Wisconsin and was for a time
a college mate in the Rev Wilson
Bixter of Neillsville The churches
of both these ministers belong to the
North Wisconsin Synod of the Evangelical
and Reformed church The
consistory of the Humbird church
consists of John Michael George Miller 
Fred Rupnow and John Bryner 
Jr and the pastor The organist is
made They have four new Mickey
Mouse books 
Mrs Purnell and Mrs Anger visited
school one day last week 
Out of 47 in the 3rd and 4th
grades 30 received 100 s 
Miss Hanson s room is decorated by
a border line of jack o lanterns It
also has a tom tom that Allen Kearney
made for geography 
The 1st and 2nd grades sang between
acts at the Junior class play
Friday night They were dressed in
costumes all of which were original 
and carried jack o lanterns in a drill 
besides speaking some pieces 
The decorations in the 1st and 2d
grade room consist of familiar Hallowe en
figures They also have some
boats along the border line They
just finished reading the poem

We have with us this year a very
promising scientist He specializes
in insects especially daddy long legs 
and deprives them of their long legs 
thereby causing them a slow torturing
death The burial place is in the
register It also thrills him to watch
the legs quiver for a few moments
after being displaced from the body 
I m telling you he s got it in his blood 
If he isn t a scientist he ll be a doctor 
or a kutcher you know there is
not much difference to him For further
details of the daddy long legs
murdered consult Kenny Kolbrak of
Merrillan 
Our romantic Romeo (otherwise
known as Skid B ) has gone Hollywood
on us He wears his latest
heart throb around his neck No other
than the great Ginger Rogers Or
are we all wrong Maybe it s that
buxom lassie from Alma Center
whose picture is on the other side that
causes his heart to go pitter patter 
What have the boys decided to
take to fixing their hair too Friday
quite a few were seen calmly strolling
around with a short braid hanging
over one eyebrow 
A couple of new fads that came
out recently are worth telling about 
I think One is the wearing of a
squirrel s tail on your belt But the
only disadvantage is that the hair
from the tail sheds something dreadful 
A
nother one is wearing a large
handkerchief (man s) gently twisted
around so as to go around your head 
Then it is tied very neatly in a knot
in the middle most part of your head 
I heard tell that it was requested
by a few brilliant high school boys
for special train to be run from here
to Alma Center just for the purpose
of carrying mail (loveletters) back
and forth 
Mrs Herman Le Captain wife of the
principal of the Humbird public
school 
Last Sunday morning Mr Weidler
preached straight and plain from the
Sermon on the Mount He quoted
the admonition to seek first the kingdom
of God This kingdom he said 
was Christ s business he talked
about it constantly during his ministry
on earth The essential quality
of the kingdom is that it is spiritual 
It is inside people 
 You may put away everything
which seems to you to be disagreeable
about the way people live and
work said Mr Weidler You may
divide all money evenly if that is
what you believe in You may be a
Socialist or a Communist or anything
else to your own taste and still you
would have the same kind of people
unless the kingdom had penetrated
inside 
 By living by his word we come
to a partial understanding of the
kingdom The kingdom does not come
wholesale It comes gradually and
individually 
 The kingdom comes first We ask
that the kingdom may come before
we ask for daily bread The kingdom
is all important 
 The kingdom is selected and selective 
Three fourths of the seed
does not produce results It falls on
stones and among the thorns and thistles 
We must trust God for the harvest 
Our duty is to do the sowing 
 The kingdom has its laws The
first law is that of service We do
not retire to the kingdom of God we
work in it The second is the law of
sacrifice The third is the law of
love 
Mr Weidler has a good pulpit style
with a clear voice and distinct enunciation 
It is never difficult to hear
him or to understand

It seems probable that another
week may wind up the special session
of Congress unless something new develops 
The senators compromised
upon further talk after having been
at it three weeks and suddenly took
up the amendments with a time limit
upon utterances upon them The
amendments offered by the administration
leaders were rather quickly
adopted but those of the opposition
met with a strong organization which
held together and held fast Some of
the amendments really were sprung
by the opposition forces and were
taken over by the leaders The Neutrality
bill as passed by the Senate
differs from the original measure 
even though much time and attention
had been given to the bill s form and
substance before it came out of the
committee 
It was the events as they have occurred
since the opening of the session
which afforded more support for
the amendments than were arguments
of members The change as to regulation
of our ocean transportation
would not have been possible two
weeks earlier notwithstanding the
great merchant marine lobby The
restrictions originally practic a l l y
would have made it possible for the
President to have stopped our ships
from entering a port in Madagascar
or Tasmania in case an under sea
craft of a belligerent nation had been
seen about either one 
As yet the members of the House
do not know whether they will have
opportunity to debate the measure
when it comes from the Senate 
Under the rules the question will
come before the House solely upon
concurrence in the changes made in
the Senate with only an hour for
debate Even among those who may
be wholly favorable to the bill as
brought over there is objection to
hurrying it through without debate 
and objections to railroading have
been made from the floor Much will
depend upon the poll of members being
quietly made The leaders now
claim that there will Joe a majority of
20 votes for passage as is but the
continued activity of administration
leaders indicates that they lack confidence
in their own figures I f a
sufficient margin has been obtained
and nailed down to make sure there
is likely to be only one hour s debate 
I f not several days may be given
over to the debate In either case it
is not expected that the rules will be
so liberalized that amendments may
be offered 
With the war fever on there is
small likelihood of the session being
prolonged for other legislation The
Speaker and some sixty members
from drought stricken districts are
endeavoring to obtain action on a
measure to appropriate $50 000 000
for the drought sufferers They have
the support of other members from
districts which have been devastated
by floods where government relief is
also demanded Only those who have
experienced the destruction by floods
or droughts realize how urgent are
such emergencies There are many
who have gobs of sympathy for those
rendered destitute by war bombs
abroad who are not so sympathetic to
the sufferers from catastrophies in
our own country So in spite of the
influence of the Speaker it is unlikely
that the sufferers in the south 
east and west will receive consideration
before the January session 
The movement to have Congress
continue in session until January has
not gained much momentum It would
seem as though there is plenty to do
which should be promptly attended to 
The farm debt question is big enough
in itself to demand a special session 
and this one might well be prolonged
for the purpose There are others of
great moment The President insists
that the leaders in both houses shall
remain in Washington during the recess
so that they may be called into
consultation should occasion demand 
His plan is likely to be adopted Some
of the leaders are planning ocean
trips notwithstanding Even if domestic
problems cannot be taken up 
the war situation abroad is big
enough in itself for Congress to remain
in session so that the representatives
of the people may be on the
ground for whatever may happen 
The government experts in several
departments are trying to analyze the
pick up in business I f the embargo
provision is repealed it is expected
that the flow of war materials to
England and France soon will run
into hundreds of millions Those two
countries have placed orders for
1 900 air planes some of which are
awaiting delivery on account of the
embargo One of the arguments for
repeal is that eight billions of dollars
of such foreign money is available
for war time purchases Some little
time will be required to key up our
industries to this war prosperity Anticipating
a great advance in commodity
prices fall and winter orders
for other than war purchases have
boomed various industries to the
point where the experts fear that
there is over production The buying
power of the people is not keeping up
with the increased production The
history of 1937 makes the experts
wary Some fear that before war orders
become large enough to prime
the business pump a slump may occur 
Nearly one half million employees
have been added to the rolls of
industry in the past few months 
There are ten million still idle A
slump would force the relief issue to
the fore at a time when plans are
underway for greater appropriations
for national defense How to judge
the future bothers more people than
just the experts 
The sea coast cities and states are
also concerned about the restriction
of ocean transportation under the
new Neutrality bill It is argued that
to make idle all our ocean shipping
would be a small price to pay for
keeping out of war But the policy
does not enter into the matter of
business stability After spending a
couple billions in grants and subsidies 
our country has over two million
tons of ocean carriers Under the
proposed restrictions about 3 1 per
cent of our ocean tonnage would be
harbor bound forbidden to enter the

The 1939 Red Cross call is again
near at hand The dates are Nov 11
to 30 
The Red Cross was founded in
1881 and has been the nation s disaster
relief agency ever since that
time In the 57 years of its existence
it has assisted in 2 200 disasters 
During this time it has expended approximately
one hundred and forty
million dollars for disaster relief 
most of it since the World War During
the past 15 years it has assisted
on an average of 92 domestic disasters
a year This obligation rests
upon every chapter in the nation of
which there now are more than 3 700 
The national organization is also
taking an active part in safety on
highways in school homes water
safety and training of nurses and
at present has a large number of
nurses working in the warring countries
in Europe and hundreds of people
all over the country are making
clothing for the men women and children
in European countries at war 
Red Cross roll call material is being
distributed throughout Jackson
county to chairmen of local units and
preparations are being made to increase
the number of memberships in
each township When your Roll Call
chairman calls on you to assist her 
or him in collecting do not refuse
to help Let s make this a banner
year 
We must all work to stresgthen this
great agency to make it worthy of
the ideals of its founders and the
challenge of today I urge that we
set our plans to increase our Red
Cross membership in Jackson county
at least one third more than last year
in every local in Jackson county for
the coming annual roll call

21 1939 at the age of 76 years

Saturday before he passed away 
Funeral services were held for him
Monday afternoon at the Lenmark

Claire Among those from away to

Lewis Thompson and brother P B 
Thompson Mr and Mrs Ed Westfall
and son Wayne of Cataract and Mr 
and Mrs R J Stoker of North
Bend 
Mr Thompson was a son of late
Mr and Mrs Judson Thompson who
lived in Shake Hollow He was married
November 20 1888 to Miss Emma
J Westfall of the town of Little
Falls Monroe coanty They lived for
a time in Sechlerville where Mr 
Thompson was engaged at his trade
of blacksmith and then moved to
Disco where he engaged in the same
work He later moved to Melrose 
where he did carpenter work in
which he was also proficient About
nine years ago he moved to Eau
Claire where he had been engaged
in working as a carpenter until a
few years ago when he retired turning
his work over to his son Harry 
who had learned the carpenter trade

The Circuit convention of the Women s
Missionary Federation will be
held in the Trempealeau Valley
church near Taylor on Tuesday Nov 
7 with registration beginning at 10
o clock The convention speaker will
be Mrs Nora Rosvold a missionary
to China who is home on furlugh 
Mrs Dan Swisher has been visiting
among her friends in this section and
making headquarters at the home of
Mr and Mrs Harry Elefson who
very hospitably entertained the members
of the Swisher family at dinner
the day of Mr Swisher s funeral 
Mrs Swisher plans to attend the
Spring Creek and Pine Grove Ladies
Aid at the home of Mrs Ernest Olson
this week so she can see all her old
neighbors before returning to Chicago 
where she will go soon 
Henry B Olson drove here from
Winegar bringing his sister Mrs Stener
Fremstad and granddaughter 
Miss Dorothy Eschenbauch and little
two year old grandson John Avery 
of Milwaukee who had been spending
the summer with her They will spend
a couple of weeks among relatives
here Mr Olson has spent most of
the summer at Winegar where he
built himself a cottage on the lake 
and has been engaged in carpenter
work and painting 
Mrs Harold Turner and son Maurice
were over night guests at the
home of Mr and Mrs O L Sprague
in Milwaukee and attended the Packers
game during the week end Miss
Harriet Hendrickson accompanied
them and was a guest of Mrs Frances
Eggen Christl 
Theodore and J C Tollack went to
Star Lake this morning to spend a
few days at their cottage 
ocean zones about belligerent nations 
The government of course 
will be expected to stand the losses
of the ship owners as it has been
doing for years but it will not pay
for the employees who lose their jobs 
ind there are thousands of them in
the eastern coast cities 
Much noise is being made by shipping
interests about this curtailment
of business To those of us who live
in land locked states the issue does
not seem so important The gross
revenues of the ships which will be
retired are about $60 000 000 annually 
It is a large sum and business
will be affected to that extent But
in 1938 the dairy farms lost over
$400 000 000 from their purchasing
power of 1937 Somehow the great
ship owners and their financiers who
are now squawking loudly over the
losses they expect to have and its
effect upon business in general were
unable to take note of what that loss
of farm buying power meant to business 
their own included

The big news is that Jess Willard 
former world s heavyweight champion
is to be among those present and will
officiate as referee You remember
when the Emperor Jones of Fistiana 
Jack Johnson had the crown
perched so securely upon his dusky
brow that it looked as if nothing but
death or old age and rheumatics
would cause him to 0ive it up Fight
managers combed the woods lumber
camps factories and plains for a
 White Hope someone big enough
and good enough to beat the Emperor
Jones and bring back to title to
the Caucasians Many were called but
none was chosen until 1915 when big
Jess Willard found himself in the opposite
comer from Mr Johnson down
Havana Way Jess dispensed enough
punches to win in the 26th round
whereupon the Royal Purple was
transferred to his towering shoulders 
(Same was forcibly removed a^Toledo 
Ohio in 1919 by one jack
Dempsey after blasting Mr Willard
for three rounds ) Anyway this is the
same Jess Willard who will be in
Eau Claire tonight

stead of exalting Jesus Christ He
says And if I be lifted up his name
lifted high by the preachers of his
word shall draw all men unto me 
People are not being draw to Jesus
today because they look to some man
instead of looking at Jesus They
don t know how to look to Jesus because
no one tells them We must
humble ourselves and confess that we
are sinners no matter how much or
how little money or high position we
have because God word says I f we
say we have no sin we deceive ourselves
and the truth is not in us If
we confess our sins He is faithful and
just to forgive us our sins and to
cleanse us from all unrighteousness 
I John 1 8 1 Also Jesus says This
is my commandment That ye love
one another as I have loved you 
Greater love hath no man than this
that a man lays down life for his
friend John 15 12 to 13 A man
lay down his life his friends when he
lay down his own work or his way of
making a living and spends all his
time and strength telling others the
way of eternal life through Jesus
Christ our Lord The lord has been
calling us to leave our work and
worldly possession and work for our
heavenly Father helping show sinners
the way of salvation for about a
month we have felt that the lord
would be pleased for us to go to the
Hunter Bridge camps and tell the Indians
there some of the good things
the Holy Spirit has shown us out
of the Bible Upon seeing what you
wrote in the news we thought perhaps
you would like to have us come
to Indian Mission We love the Indians 
They are our brothers and sis
ters They treat us better than we do
them They show us the golden ruler
where we do not to them I f you
would like to have us come up there
next Sunday telephone Vincent Bros 
at Galesville and we will pay for the
call I f you would rather wait until
some later day write us Ask God
in prayer what would be his will for
Your Brother and Sister in Jesus 
you to do

could not get any sleep at all I felt
just like I would scream as I was in
such agony I heard of RUX and what
wonderful relief it has brought to
others so decided to try it Soon I
began to feel better those pains were
easing up and I have been able to
get my regular sleep My friends who
were accustomed to seeing me in my
suffering are more than surprised to
see me now I am truly thankful for
the way RUX brought me relief and
I have been gladly recommending it
