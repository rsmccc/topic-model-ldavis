FORTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY. WISCONSIN, THURSDAY, AUGUST 10, 1939
Coalition Collapses
The biggest news story of a legislative
session which has produced more
than its share of news was written
during1 the last few days. It told of
the collapse, with a crash heard
throughout the state, of the crucial
Republican-Democratic coalition in the
state senate. As anxious Republican
administration men continued today to
try to reassemble the wreckage, the
state wondered about the ultimr.te fate
of Governor Heil’s extensive legislative
program.
During the last year a new word
was thrust upon tht* vocabulary of
Wisconsin citizens and voters. The
concept of coalition is old in politics,
but it became a real political factor in
the 1938 campaigns when a group of
Democrats and Republicans joined in a
committee dedicated to a campaign to
defeat the La Follette regime.
The effort was more successful than
most people anticipated. While the
Coalition candidate for governor was
defeated in the Republican primary,
he withdrew from the Democratic
ticket where he had been chosen and
threw his considerable support to
Julius P. Heil, the regular G. O. P.
nominee. Heil’s landslide election, the
election of three Coalition-nominated
state constitutional officers, and the
poor showing of the Democratic state
ticket, in effect gave thc whole new
administration a Coalition character.
That fact was made more clear
when the legislature assembled in
January. Administration leaders
counted noses and found that their
party had elected only sixteen members
to the state senate, one short of
a majority. The Democrats had six
members, and the Progressives eleven.
On strict party lines, no party had a
majority. Fusion was necessary for
successful functioning of the upper
house.
Democrats Cooperate
Led by the party’s standard-bearer
of 1938, veteran Senator Harry Bolens
of Port Washington, the Democrats
agreed to support .major administration
proposals. The friendly relationship
between bhe minority party and
the victorious administration was cemented
a iittle later when Governor
Heil reappointed William E. O’Brien,
prominent Democrat, to the highway
commission, and gave James Corcoran,
former state Democratic chairman,
another term on the important state
conservation commission.
For six months the Coalition arrangement
was responsible for whatever
success the Heil program was
accorded in the senate. There were
occasional eruptions of dissatisfaction,
apparent evidence of discord. Rut a
large part of the sweeping and controversial
reorganization program,
snd the No. 1 bill of every session—
the biennial budget bill—got through
the house safely.
Then last week, after long delays,
revisions, and reconsideration, the
administration brought its $10,000,000
tax bill to the floor of the upper
house. As approved by the Republicandominated
assembly, the bill was
about $10,000,000 short of producing
sufficient revenue to balance the $73,-
000,000 biennial appropriation total.
In order to facilitate the enactment of
new revenues,, the administration
sought to amend the $16,000,000
measure—consisting of liquor, income,
cigarette and corporation taxes— to
provide the $10,000,000 needed.
That issue smashed the Coalition.
Republicans, after caucusing almost
constantly over a period of several
days, brought to the floor their plan
to enact an additional one cent tax on
gasoline, which would raise the needed
$10,000,000, in the expectation that the
Democratic votes would put it over.
Administration Beaten
But the Democrats balked. Moreover,
three of the Republican senators
deserted the administration banner to
send the proposal to its death in rapid
order.
When the same fate met a second
amendment proposing a boost of Mi
cent in the gasoline tax. Republican
Floorleader Maurice Coakley of Beloit
hurried across the chamber to whisper
to Progressive Minority Leader Phil
Nelson.
A moment later the Democratic senators
found what they consider one of
their most important bills withdrawn
from the calendar and before the
house for action. It was the Shimek-
Goldthorpc bill, already approved by
the lower house, which would apportion
thousands of precinct election
booth jobs to political parties on the
basis of their presidential votes.
The present law divides the patronage
according to the vote for governor.
Since they ran a poor third last
fall, Democrats enjoy little patronage
under the present system. With a
NUMBER 39
heavy presidential vote in 1936, they
would control a majority of the poll
jobs if the apportionment were put on
a presidential vote basis.
Since they have no presidential tic
ket, the Progressives would have lost
substantial numbers of jobs under the
Shimek-Goldthorpe bill. Accordingly
they listened appreciatively to Coak
ley’s offer to defeat the Democrats by
helping them to kill the bill.
And killed it was, 25 to 7.
Enraged Democrats promptly kicked
over the traces, denounced the Repub
licans for their action, and announced
in unison that their alliance with the
Republican administration is at an
end. The next morning the five Dem
ocratic members signed a resolution
nroposimr final adjournment on Aug.
11, assailing the Republicans for their
ingratitude, and declaring that con
tinuation of the “ legislature is futile.’
Pacification Tried
Administration strategists almost
immediately realized that the defection
of the Democrats imperils the
success of the whole administration
program and may well make impossible
the passage of any tax legisla
tion.
Worried about the potential results,
the Republican leadership promptly
adjourned both houses, while administration
diplomats began the difficult
task of trying to pacify the rebellious
Democrats.
The degree of their success was this
week the most important public question
in W'isconsin. Upon their efforts
may well lie the success or failure of
Governor Heil and his Republican administration.
Tax Worry Still
Thus today, as for many weeks past
the principal concern of the Republican
regime is budget-balancing.
Somewhere, somehow the Republicans
must find $26,000,000 in revenues to
augment the shrinking yields of tht
old revenue laws. The struggle has
gone on for weeks, and there was no
hint of an early solution as the legislature
entered its eighth consecutive
month of deliberations under the capitol
dome.
Numerous suggestions have been
advanced. Sales taxation, all kinds of
. special Aide* Utxe*. utility taxation,
income taxation, diversion of huge
quantities of highway funds, all have
had their day in the lime-light. Still
the problem remains.

REV. E. J. HOMME
Founder of the Homme Institutions
l*lea for Less Disturbance
at l.nral Hand Concerts
This in a plea to thc parents of
children attending band concerts.
Please, just for once, accompany your
children to the concert. I am sure
that none of you would sanction their
behavior at these concerts. It may be
that you do not care for band music,
which is the reason you do not attend
them—and I am sure that you parents
are not there— because you could not
possibly be and allow your children to
misbehave as they do.
Last Friday night the concert was
given for the pleasure of the old folks,
and I am sure they heard very little
of the music from the front porch
where they were seated, as it must
have been lost in the noise the youngsters
made. There was hair pulling,
fighting, yelling, dirt and grass throw
ing, and about everything one can
think of to spoil the concert. Some of
the ladies sitting next to me got their
hair full of dirt from the road, and
upon asking the children to calm down,
they got in back of the ladies anti
made faces at them.
It is an insult to Mr. Turecek anti
the members of the band to act like
this. I f I were givi'ng the concert, I
would have stopped before the second
number. Just think what it means to
try to perform with such distraction
We, who go to hear the music, appreciate
their efforts, and just a little cooperation
on the part o f the parents
in either being there to look after
their children, or instructing them tn
behave when they leave home, would
make it much more enjoyable for all
concerned.
Mrs. F. W. Hansen.
Anything But What We Are
One of the most ingratiating of all
human traits is the wistful anxiety of
men to seem to be something they are
not.
The society climber scrambles and
wangles to be seen in a set where she
by no right belongs; the celebrity
hunter fights to be seen with people
who are not interested in him; and all
of us strive mightily to achieve an
appearance of being something we are
not.
The man who has never been out of
the country buys phony luggage labels
and plasters them on his suitcase,
hoping to give the people the impression
that Cairo and Kamchatka and
Ceylon are just week-end excursions
to him.
And now comes the phony auto
plate nicely stamped in colors, with
the insignia of Erin or Greece or
Egypt, so that drivers can give anj
impression to unknown passersby that
they have toured far lands.
It is silly, and stupid, and may cause
confusion in identifying a car in an
emergency, but it is so very, very
human!— Antigo Journal.
Marathon County
Fair Will Open
Next Saturday
Outstanding Program of Many
Activities Will Be
Featured Daily
The seventy-first Wisconsin Valley
F air and Exposition, opening at Wausau
Saturday. August 12th, and continuing
through Thursday, August
17th, will present the most extensive
and varied program of any similar exposition
in the state this vear. Activities
on the opening day, however, will
be confined to receiving and arranging
exhibits and displays, the carnival and
midway attractions being the only
amusement activities.
The fair opens to the public Sunday
noon. August 13th, Elks' Day, with
one of the most complete programs to
be desired. Two harness races for the
Elks’ purses of $300 each, are scheduled
for the afternoon program in addition
to ten feature grandstand
presentations. Something new and
different is included in each day’s
activities th*s year, and the management
of the fair is confident the
months of planning for this annual
event will result in one of the best
and most complete fairs to be held in
the state.
The night fair programs possess exceptional
merit, comprising four presentations
of Ernie Young’s great
stage show. “Calvacade of Hits.”
presented with a cast of more than 70
people. This show, now completing a
tour of the east anti of the Canadian
fair circuits, has broken attendance
records at nearly every engagement.
It is probably one of the most complete
and colorful presentations to
come to the fair.
Harness races will he held again on
Tuesdav and Wednesday afternoons,
in addition to the other attractions.
Dairy Dav observance on Tuesday,
August 15th, should hold the personal
interest of every one in the county interested
in this great industry. The
Marathon county Dairy Queen, who
will represent this section in the state
contest to be held in Milwaukee, will
be chosen during the forenoon on that
day, and the coronation ceremonies in
connection with the evening program
will provide a colorful interlude in the
revue presentation.
The program on Thursday, August
17t.h, will be of an outstanding nature,
presented by Hinck’s Consrress of
Thrills. On that day Capt. Don Voge
will crash a speeding airplane throuirh
a frame house, as one of the highlights
in a two and one-half hour program
of chills and thrills. Fireworks
displays will close each evening’s program,
starting Sunday through Wednesday.
Livestock and other displays at the
fair this year will be up to the usual
high standard and all of the cattle,
sheep, swine, poultry and horse barns
will be well filled, officials of the fair
state. Admissions remain at the same
popular prices that have prevailed for
several years. As a community activity
it is felt by the fair management
that these should be within reach of
everyone as the fair is not a profitmaking
venture. More than $7,000 in
premiums will be distributed this
year, nearly half of this amount being
paid out in the 4-H club divisions.
Tragedy blotted out a family vacation
late yesterday when a father and
his three-year-old son drowned in Pine
j lake before the eyes of four other
members of the family.
The victims were Edward G. Billj
meyer, 41, manager of the J. C. Penney
store at Clintonville, and the
youngest of his five sons, Kenneth,
whom he attempted to rescue after
the child fell from a boat. Pine lake
is one in the Cloverleaf chain eight
miles southeast of Shawano.
Kenneth was in a boat with his
mother and two other brothers, Robert,
6, and Jack, 7. when he tumbled
into the water. Billmeyer dove in
from a nearby raft and grabbed Kenneth.
W'hile swimming back to the
raft with the child, both went under
and did not come up. Two older sons,
James, 15, anti Tom, 12, and other vacationers
made futile rescue attempts.
Within a short time more than
twenty boats were carrying parties
searching for the bodies.
The bodies were recovered about
8:45, nearly five hours after the tragedy
had occurred.
Funeral services for the two will be
held Thursday morning at Wisconsin
Ranids, Survivors include the widow
anti four sons, Billmeyer’s parents,
Mr. and Mrs. F. F. Billmeyer, of Wisconsin
Rapids; two brothers, Paul of
Wisconsin Rapids and Victor of Waupaca.
and a sister, Mrs. E. L. Zeamon
of Stevens Point.
TENANT PURCHASE
COMMITTEE NAMED
Notice was received this week by
Rudolph Christiansen, Shawano county
Farm Security administration supervisor,
that a committee of three
farmers has been appointed by Secretary
Wallace to assist in administering
the FSA tenant purchase program.
Those named by the secretary of
agriculture are Walter Wright, of
Gresham, Fred Harriman, of Shawano,
Route 2, ami Roman Muskavitch, of
Shawano, Route 3.
These men wil1 assist Christiansen
in administering the tenant purchase
program, which provides for the making
of loans to a limited number of
Shawano county tenants for the purchase
of farms. Isoans will be made
only on productive farms which are
so priced that the loan can be repaid
by the borrowed from farm earnings.
One of the main duties of the committee
will be to investigate applicants
and recommend those whom they believe
should receive loans. The basis
for this recommendation will center
largely on the character, experience
and family ability of the applicant.
In addition, preference will be given
those who own, relatively free from
debt, the necessary livestock anti
equipment and who may be able to
make a down payment. No loans will
be made, however, to persons who can
obtain an adequate loan from other
sources at reasonable terms, Mr.
Christiansen said.
Interested and eligible tenants can
make application for loans at the FSA
office in Shawano.
Dies in Milwaukee
We learn that Mr*. Esther McCab*'
(nee Long) passetl away in Milwaukee'
Monday night. The funeral is to be
held in Caroline tomorrow (Friday) |
forenoon. Mrs. McCabe was the oldest
daughter of the late Frank Long
and spent her girlhood days in this
community.

A Word About This
Week’s Supplement
Through the courtesy of Dr. R. L.
Lokensgard, manager of Homme
Children's Home, which publishes
“ For Gammel og Ung” ( “For Old
and Yoinig” ), the Enterprise this
week is carrying a copy of that
paper as a supplement because of
the interesting letters from former
boys and girls of the Home that are
to be found in its pages and all
having local color and background.
“ For (iammel og lin g ,” now in its
59th year, is usually about twothirds
Norwegian and one-third
English in its contents. In this issue
the contents are all English
because the 16 pages were required
to accommodate all the letters that
came in response to Dr. Lokensgard's
request recently conveyed to
former boys and girls of the institution
for an account of their experiences
while here, for publication
in “ For Gammel og Ung” in
the issue immediately preceding the
annual festival on August 13.
Although there was only about
ten days’ time to decide in the matter
anl to write the letter and have
it in Dr. Lokensgard’s hands, the
response was remarkably prompt
and general. Spontaneously written,
the letters are nevertheless full
o f interesting and well-presented
reading matter- all the better, perhaps,
because of this spontaneity.
We are happy to present this
supplement. And to do so is altogether
fitting in view of tho
Home’s historical and other connections
with this community.

CONGRESS:
Drifting
Time was when C. I. 0 . ‘s John L.
Lewis and President Roosevelt were
close friends. If this was an excuse
for anti-Roosevelt sentiment
in the rural U. S., such sentiment
might have been dispelled the day
Jo h n Lew'is appeared before a hostile
house labor committee. In a few
choice words he denounced proposed
amendments to the 1938 fair labor
standards act. In a few more he
called Vice President Garner a “ labor-
baiting, poker-playing, whiskeydrinking,
evil old m an . . . "
While this denunciation at least
won Ja ck Garner the poker-playing

and whiskey-drinking vote if he runs
for President next year, its actual
effect was much greater—indeed, it
was stupendous. By denouncing
wage-hour amendments Mr. Lewis
stepped on rural toes (especially in
tbe South) which wanted processors
of agricultural products eliminated
from m in im um w'age requirements.
Thus he fanned into a blaze the
growing coalition between Republicans
and rural Democrats who are
coolish toward the New Deal. Cheering
Ja c k Garner in house and senate,
this group proceeded to raise
havoc with President Roosevelt’s pet
multi-billion lend-spend program,
aim ed to hasten recovery.
In the senate a $2,490,000,000 origin
a l proposal lost a $500,000,000 item
for toll highways, bridges and tunnels,
another $350,000,000 for leasing
equipment to railroads. In the house
the bill was tied in committee. While
adjournment hinged on this bill and
no other, Senate Majority Leader
Alben Barkley had to bite his fingernails
and listen to an irrelevant twohour
neutrality harangue by North
Dakota’s Sen. Gerald P. Nye. F inally,
after remarking quietly that
•‘there seems to be some sort of an
undercurrent that’s causing this bill
to drift,” he dashed from the chamber
and yelled at waiting reporters:
•‘I don't know anything about anyth
in g !”
F inally passed and sent to the
house, the emasculated measure
looked something like this: (000,000

The price Senator Barkley had to
p ay for his measure: (1) adoption of
the amendment of V irg inia’s Harry

government securities financing the
project; (2) offering his own compromise
amendment reducing Export-
Import bank loans to $75,000,-

(AGRICULTURE:
Subsidies
Last year the U. S. agriculture departm
e nt placed 118.000,000 bushels
©f wheat on the world market, losing
an average of 27 cents a bushel
in subsidies because U. S. prices
were above world levels. This year
world production will hit a new high
and Liverpool prices have reached
their lowest levels since 1592. Thus,
to compete on the world market
and still give farmers a fair price
lo r exported wheat, the U. S. would
suffer a subsidy loss of between 45
and 50 cents a bushel.
Offsetting bigger subsidies, however,
is smaller domestic production.
As Secretary of Agriculture
Henry A. Wallace began estimating
production, domestic consumption,
required carryover and export surpluses,
the picture looked brighter.
Although a 100,000,000 export would
cost the treasury between $45,000,-
000 and $50,000,000, the U. S. probably
will not ask so great a share of
the world market when the international
wheat conference meets in
London. To m aintaio a carryover
of 175,000,000 to 200.000.000 bushels,
en export of only 70,000,000 is needed.
Thus, compared with the $31,-
860,000 spent on subsidies last year,
a 50-cent subsidy this year would
cost only $4,000,000 more.
Referendum
Only as a last resort does the agriculture
department want to hold a
referendum on corn m arketing quotas
for next year. With production
estimates running high and flirting
with the mandatory referendum figure,
President Roosevelt signed an
amendment to the AAA act allowing
Secretary Wallace to delay the
election, basing his decision on the
crop board’s September 1 report instead
of the August 1 estimate. Other
amendments, placing marketing
quotas for wheat, corn and cotton
all on a s im ilar basis:
C Perm it corn and wheat growers
who plant within their acreage allotment
their entire crop without
penalty when a quota is in effect.
C Extend indefinitely the 55.000.000-
acre m in im um allotment for wheat.
C Extend indefinitely the 10,000.000-
bale m in im um in establishing cotton
acreage.
WHITE HOUSE:
Hatch Hill
Passed by both senate and house,
the bill of New Mexico’s Sen. Carl
A. Hatch to “ clean up” politics found
its way to the President’s desk for
signing or veto. Its purpose: To
remove influence or interference of
all federal administrative officials
from elections or nominating efforts
for President. Its result: Incumbent
federal administrations will find
their personal payroller machines of
little help at nomination or election
time. But state machines will wield
great power.
Whether he liked it or not, President
Roosevelt told his press conference
he favored the bill’s “ objectives,”
yet he feared it was unconstitutional
because vaguely drawn.
For example, what can people legitimately
do under its very broad language?
Can officeholders attend political
rallies or voluntarily contribute
to a friend’s campaign expenditures?
Pending a decision from Attorney
General Frank Murphy, the
bill awaited presidential action. If
not signed or vetoed by August 3,
Mr. Hatch’s bill would become law.
The White House also:
C Nominated Jam es Lawrence Fly,
TVA solicitor, to succeed much-persecuted
Frank R. McNinch as a
member of the federal communications
commission.
C. Ordered Secretary of State Cordell
H ull to move from the second to
the fourth floor of the old State,
War and Navy building, making
room for the six ‘‘assistant presidents”
appointed under the reorganization
bill, men with ‘‘a passion for
anonymity."
RUSSIA:

CONSTANTIN OL’MANSKY
Purgee?
Premier and Foreign Commissar
Vyacheslav Molotov announced in
the Official Gazette the names of 79
high military and diplomatic officials
who had been “ stripped of
their decorations,” i.e., placed under
arrest, for “ actions unw'orthy of
order bearers.” Biggest shakeup
was in the Japanese-pestered F ar
East, where Gen. Grigorio Shtern
(successor to the vanished Marshal
Vassily Bluecher) was succeeded by
General Popov.
The other bit of news was gathered
from such widely separated
points as Berlin, Rome, Washington,
and Tokyo. In each case Soviet
embassies reported their ambassadors
missing. Washington’s Constantin
Oumansky, who sailed from New
York Ju ly 5 for a “ vacation” back
home, had not been heard from
since he watched Moscow's annual
physical culture parade two weeks

Molotov, who has been shaking

ever since he replaced Comrade
Litvinov, is doing some more shaking
up—possibly via the customtested

in 15 years. At Baldwin, N. Y .,

WASHINGTON.—Advocates of repeal
of a prohibitive whale oil tax,
seeking to prevent the extinction of
the American whaling industry,
made a very favorable impression
in congress, one gathers from talks
with senators and representatives,
so that there is the possibility that
it will be a live issue next year.
This m ay be too late for the present
interested group, as without repeal
of the tax they declare they cannot
possibly start operations for next
season.
What the whale people want to
repeal is a three-cent excise tax on
whale oil which is obtained from
whales killed by “ killer ships” flying
a foreign flag. The situation is
that the killer ships used by the
American concern involved are Norwegian,
and the gunners in every
instance are Norwegian.
I t is claim ed that Americans will
eventually become adept gunners,
but there are none left of the men
who once gave the American whaling
industry world leadership. Their
exodus began with the C ivil war,
when Confederate privateers drove
them from the seas, and practically
concluded when their wooden craft,
in twos and threes and whole fleets,
were caught in ice packs in the
polar regions after the whales had
been driven from warmer waters.
The skill of the gunner is not
merely that of a marksman, it is
explained. That is important, but
only one of the little steps. The
m ain art lies in figuring where a
whale will come up, after he has
been sighted blowing and then has
dived beneath the surface. The Norwegians
have becorr-.e marvelously
accurate in this calculation, and
hence bag more whales and waste
less tim e on the part of the killer
ships than amateurs would.
Hence, it is claimed, it is im practical
to use Americans for this
job, until they have been trained,
and it is also said to be impractical
to use American flag killer ships.
The tankers that bring the product
back from the killer ships to port
do fly the American flag, and the
enterprise is owned by an American
corporation.
Purpose of Tax Was to
A id the American Farmer
A little joke on the company is
that when it flrst acquired a big
tanker ship for this purpose, the
United States government had a
loan on the vessel. Had this loan
been allowed to stand the treasury
would have had a considerable interest
in not having the vessel made
worthless. But the loan was paid
off, so Uncle Sam was lost as a
partner!
The alleged purpose of the tax,
which was added to the 1938 revenue
bill at the last moment, was to aid
the American farmer. Congressmen
were given to understand that the
dairy interests were for the amendment.
It develops that none of the
whale products compete with any
edible fats. They compete chiefly
with inedible fats and tallow rendered
from garbage.
As domestic sources supply less
than 60 per cent of domestic requirements
for inedible fats, it is
contended that the protection granted
favors one American industry at
the expense of another.
The company interested also informs
congressmen that the whaling
ships of all nations employ Norwegian
gunners and Norwegian killer
ships.
1Vo Hope for Railroads
U ntil the Next Session
There is no hope tor the railroads
until the next session of congrcss.
In fact, the bill which the senate approved
but which will continue to
sleep in conference until January
does not contain very much hope either.
The real situation is that
there is small probability of congrcss
being willing to do anything
which would be of any real help to
the roads.
The curious part of all this is that
both congress and President Roosevelt
are really anxious to do something
for the carriers. It is not a
question of being against the vested
interests, nor of a pet peeve. There
is really no outstanding figure in
public life who is crusading against
the railroads. The trouble lies deeper.
It lies in the fact that, having
been strait-jacketed so long, by the
government on the one hand and the
unions on the other, the roads just
began to sicken when they got up
against truck and bus competition.
A distinguished Middle Western
banker jolted several senators at
dinner the other night by his insistence
that It was rate reductions
and 4axes that had hit the railroads.
He insisted that the volume of traffic,
considering freight traffic, which
is all that most of the railroads
really profit on, was greater than
in various boom years which could
be cited, despite the huge amount
of freight now carried by trucks.
He had so many statistics that
he had the senators dizzy, all tending
to show that the railroads had
enormously incrA sed their efficiency,
but that the tremendous increase
in the burden of taxes, plus the
constant reductions in their rates,
had gotten them down.
Real Wallop for Railroads
Comes From Local Taxation
This burden of taxes is heavy
enough if only those imposed by
the federal government are considered,
but the real wallop comes
from local taxes, state, county and
city or town.
“ Most small towns are strung out
along the railroad tracks,” said this
banker. “ Every time the town needs
more revenue its council extends the
city lim its so as to take in more
railroad property to tax.”
The trouble is, senators point out
privately, that there is no earthly
way of reaching this situation. Congress
can't very well pass a law
which will declare that interstate
carriers are not subject to local taxation!
Even it such a measure were
conceivable, politically, which it certainly
is not, the problem then would
arise, where are these towns going
to get their revenue?
A sm all county in northwestern
North Carolina gets 42 per cent of
all its revenue from taxes on one
line of railroad which runs through
the county, end to end. It just so
happens that (his particular railroad
—the Carolina, Clinchfield  Ohio—
has been in the hands of receivers
for some tim e and has none too
good prospects. There is no attempt
here to prove that this railroad is
overtaxed, and that relieved of this
sort of burden it could get along
without being a problem child to
congress. That would certainly enter
a controversial field.
Continuance of Alcatraz
Certain Despite Murphy
Connecticut politics, mixed up
with President Roosevelt’s desire—
whatever he m ay eventually decide
to do to keep the ways greased
for his own nomination for a third
term—is w hat makes continuance of
A lcatraz certain despite the eagerness
of Attorney General F ran k
Murphy to get rid of this “ Am erican
Devil’s Is lan d .”
It so happens that Sen. Francis
T. Maloney is up for re-election in
Connecticut next year, and he is
very anxious to go on being a senator.
Maloney knows all about the
enthusiasm for Roosevelt and the
New Deal in Bridgeport and other
industrial centers in the Nutmeg
state, but he also knows about antithird
term sentiment in the rural
sections. After weighing the pros
and cons very deliberately he has
decided that his own chances for reelection
w ill be very m uch better if
some other Democrat than Roosevelt
is the presidential nominee next
year. And he is more interested in
his own re-election than in giving the
New Dealers a chance to prove him
wrong.
In his defense it should be stated
that a senator who finds his own
state is strong one way is apt to
believe that he has read national
sentiment also. Which would mean
that Maloney would have to believe
that as a third-term candidate
Roosevelt could not be elected,
whereas another Democrat might
be.
Whether Maloney is right or not
has nothing to do with the case.
That is his judgm ent, which means
that his influence in selecting Connecticut's
delegation to the Democratic
national convention will be
thrown toward picking men and
women who w ill be against Roosevelt's
renomination.
But this does not fit in with present
White House plans at all. Whatever
the President may decide to do
next June, it is certain at present
that the President wants to be
able to be renominated. Some think
he wants this strength in order to
choose the candidate to succeed
h im , and some think he wants four
more years in the White House.
But there is no doubt about the desire
to have pro-Roosevelt and prothird
term delegates chosen.
Ilomer Cummings, All Smiles,
Xow Enters the Picture
Which is where former Attorney
General Homer S. C um m ings enters
the picture. He is still very potent
politically in Connecticut. He was
its national com m itteem an for many
years, was once ch airm an of the
national committee, up to and including
the San Francisco convention.
and still is reputed to hold his
own county in the hollow of his
hand.
Cum m ings has been advocating a
third term for Roosevelt every time
anyone would give h im a chance by
asking a question. Sometimes, when
no one brought up the subject. It
so happens that no other prominent
Democratic organization leader in
Connecticut has been doing this—
certainly no one who has proved his
ability to get delegates.
So when Homer Cummings
dropped in on his old chief a few
days ago he found the President
most cordial—and willing to listen.
Em erging, C um m ings was all
smiles. Hc declined to discuss what
he had talked to the President about.
But when asked a question about
the San Francisco bay prison he
said: "A lca traz w ill be there when
Murphy and I are both in our

His advocacy of peaceful adjustm

from experience in the

the war to avenge the death in

he found his age no har to

that, at the' time of his enlistment,
the Czechs had hoys who
were but eight years old under
arms.
His biography opens at Prague,
where, at 18, he was playing walkon
parts at the Deutches Landes
theater—a soldier in “ Lohengrin,” a
servant in social comedy, anything,
' everything, of extremely subordi-
1 nate character. Gaining a rather
im portant speaking part through
ability displayed in reading the lines
of an indisposed actor, he subsequently
received a scholarship in
the Academy of Dram atic Art in
Prague. He then went to Breslau,
where Kaethe Dorsch, the German
actress, discovered h im and introduced
h im to the Berlin theater,
where he became overnight the
adored of feminine Berlin.
He m arried Ada Nejedly, an opera
ginger in Prague in 1928, from

ried “ Margo,” Margarita Balando,
stage and screen dancer. He is
tall and slight, his features extremely

Bowdon. They came in relays.
About 7:50 Mrs. Taine came to
put Mr. and Mrs. H urdef to bed.
About eighl, Asa Taine came
for a cup of tea, used m ilk out
of the bottle.
After he left, Mrs. Taine heated
m ilk for Mr. and Mrs. Hurder.
R a b Taine came in to say
good night. The m ilk was on the
slove. He sLood near the stove.
Then he le fl for Providence.
Aboul 8:25 Mrs. Taine left,
Mr. and Mrs. H urder in bed.
About 8:30 Miss Leaford
turned out downstairs lights and
went to her room. About 8:45
she met Clint outside.
About 11:05 C lint and Miss
Leaford returned and stopped in
front of the house.
About 11:10 they saw the flre.
At 11:19 exactly, the ala rm
was rung in. The apparatus arrived
at exactly 11:23. Mrs.
Taine and Asa arrived at the
flre about 11:21.
At exactly 11:51 Mrs. Taine
put ln a call for Providence to
her son.
While June and C lint studied this
•chedule in silence. Tope explained:
"Y o u know when you went up-
■tairs, and when you went out to
meet C lint; and I've guessed at the
times before that. I know when
the ala rm was rung in, and when
the apparatus arrived; and by ailowing
for all you and Clint did after
you saw the flre and before the apparatus
arrived, I can figure out
about the time you saw the fire.”
“ Yes,” June said. “ This seems
•b out right.”
“ I ’ve a record of the call to Providence,”
Tope added. “ How bad
was the fire then— when your aunt
went to phone?”
“ The whole house was b urnin g,"
June decided.
Tope nodded. ‘‘There's one other
question I'v e got to ask you,” he
said gravely. " P o you think any
one of—your relatives might have
given your mother poison? O r set
the house on fire?”
“ No, n o ," June whispered. “ They
were hard and stubborn; but— No.
N o.”
"D id any of them except your
mother ever take a sleeping-powd
e r? " he insisted.
She hesitated. "W hy, yes," she
said doubtfully. "U ncle Justus d id ."
And she explained in a faint amusement:
"H e really had insomnia,
sometimes. It seems odd, because
he could always sleep in a ch air;
but sometimes he couldn’t sleep in
bed. Doctor Cabler gave h im some
tablets once; but Aunt Evie took
them away from him , wouldn’t leL
h im use them. So poor Uncle Justus
used to ask me to give him a tablet
out of Molher's bottle, now and
then; and I know R a b took some
for h im once.”
"W hen was th a t? " Tope asked
gravely.
“ About a month ago,” June reflected.
" I found R a b in the bathroom;
he told m e.”
Tope wagged his head; but he
did not push this m atle r further.
"D id you know Miss T hayer?" he
asked. “ Her name's Lissa."
"Y e s ,” June assented. "T hat is,
J saw her sometimes, when 1 was
walking in the woods."
"D id you ever see your cousin
Asa with her?” Tope asked. The
girl shook her head; and Tope explained:
“ I saw them kiss each other tonight,
at the fire. They were back
in the shadows, but I saw."
“ A sa?” June cried incredulously.
“ You never knew anything about
th a t? "
"O h , no,” she declared. "B u t if
Asa loved her, he wouldn't have
dared tell anyone. They'd have been
furious. Aunt Evie, and (Grandma
Bowdon, I m e an."
"Y o u think so?" Tope prompted
her.
"Y e s ! Mother used to tell me—”
She hesitated, went bravely on:
“ Mother used to tell me lh al if I
m arried without their consent, they
would crush me. They did crush
her, you know.”
Inspector Tope nodded; and he
picked his words wilh care. "Y o u
remember Mr. Glovere, who lived
in Ihe cabin in the woods— the man
you called Uncle J im . You liked
him, did n 't you?”
“ Yes,” she said. "So much. He
went away, after Mother died."
"H e 's come b ack," the Inspector
paid.
"Where is he ?" she cried eagerly.
Tope hesitated, he confessed at
last: "Inspector Heale is holding
h im .”
“ You m ean—arrested h im ? ” Her
cheek was pale.
“ Heale thought he might have had
something to do— ”

That Gets the Crowds
A steam shovel always seems
to do its work so amply.
It was Kd Howe who said that
"every m an should be arrested
about two times in his life for
what he thinks."
“ O h,” she protested in loyal pride.
“ Uncle J im wouldn’t. No, no.”
“ He came back at noon today,”
Tope explained. “ Came back asking
for you . . . Miss Leaford, I
used to be a policeman. I ’m trying
to find out what happened out there.
You understand that we are sure
your mother, somehow, was poisoned.
Someone put some extra tablets
in that glass of m ilk she drank.
It might have been done while the
m ilk was still in the bottle, in Mrs.
Bowdon’s refrigerator. Or afterward
in your grandmother’s kitchen,
or on the way upstairs, or after it
wras taken upstairs. And anyone
m ig h t have done it. Anyone at all.”
The girl was trembling, but her
eyes were steady.
And when he did not speak, she
cried: “ Why should they do a thing
like th a t? ”
He said slowly: “ They might have
been afraid—afraid of something we
don’t know about. Or wanting something.”
And he spoke to Miss Moss.
“ Justus Taine has all the wills, Bowdon’s
and Hurder’s. He wouldn’t tell
me w hat’s in them. They’ll be public
by and by, but—there may not
“ Clint, whoever did this is a
monster, not h um a n.”
be tim e .” His tone was deeply troubled.
He spoke to June. “ You and
your cousins would inherit all the
money, I expect,” he said. “ All the
money in the fam ily .”
“ I don’t know,” she confessed.
“ Was there m u ch ?” But before he
could answer, she cried: “ That
doesn’t matter now’, though.” R ising
anger steadied her. “ I want to
know who killed m y m other,” she
said.
Tope looked at her apprisingly.
“ Mean that, do you?”
“ Of course.”
“ Because,” he said, “ you can help
find out! This is ugly business to
talk about, hard to believe. But
Miss Leaford, your grandpa, Mr.
Hurder, is out there, in that house,
near dying. It wouldn’t take much
to make him die. Whoever set fire
to the house last night wants him
dead.” And after a moment Tope
added soberly: “They refuse to have
a nurse for h im .”
He shook his head; he said in a
grim and stricken tone.
“ I think there’s an insane m u rderer
loose out there—insane, and
clever as a cat. He’s managed to
get by so far without leaving a
trace. I t ’s the first time in forty
years that I ’ve seen a case without
one single lead.”
C lint cried: “ What are you getting
at, Inspector?”
Tope hesitated for a moment. He
ignored Clint, said slowly then:
“ There’s one more thing you ought
to know, Miss Leaford: Inspector
Heale has arrested this m an you call
Uncle J im . Heale thinks he did it.”
“ But why should he?” she protested.
“ What reason had h e?”
And Tope said briefly, kindly:
“ He’s your father, Ju n e .”
For a long moment then, silence
held them all. June sat still, and
the color drained out of her cheeks
till she was white as snow. Clint
caught her, and she clung to h im ;
yet she did not hide her face from
them. She stared at Inspector Tope,
and her eyes were streaming, and
her lips worked as though she would
speak, but no words came. She
watched h im , and tears streamed
down her cheeks, and she began to
hiccough with smothered sobs.
Tope spoke slowly, in explicit
terms. “ Your mother ran away
with h im when she was a girl,” he
said. “ By and by they came home
to live; and after two years there,
the old folks broke it up. Mrs.
Bowdon and Mrs. Taine, he told me,
turned your mother against him. He
said Mr. and Mrs. H urder were on
his side, but the others broke them
down. Finally he left. He wanted
your mother to go with h im , but she
was afraid, so he went away alone.”
And he explained: “ He d id n ’t
know about you till afterward, years
afterward. When you were about
ten years old. he came back and
met you in the woods, and you told
h im who you were. So he stayed,
to be near you, lived in the cabin
there. They wanted to put him off
the land; but there wasn’t any divorce,
and he threatened to make
trouble unless they let h im stay.
He d idn’t ask anything of them except
to be near you, to see you
sometimes.”
He looked at Miss Moss, sure she
w’ould understand. “ I guess he still
loved Kitty Leaford,” he said.
“ When she died, it hit him hard.
He went away; but he came back
yesterday, says he was asleep in
his cabin all last night. So Heale
has locked him up.”
“ It would seem simple enough to
Heale,” she pointed out. “ Heale
will say that Mr. Leaford killed Mrs.
Leaford and then the Hurders, so
that June would inherit their money.
Then he could claim June as
his daughter, and get her and the
money too.”
June moved, about to speak; and
C lint held her close, protectingly.
She said faintly:
“ I can remember once, when I
was a little girl, Aunt Evie tried to
m ake me stay away from h im , and
I told him , and he came to the
house to see her, and after that ahe
never bothered me .
“ But he d id n’t do this!'* She
rubbed her eyes with her hands like
one just waking; she stood up, supporting
herself by C lint’s arm. “ Oh,
I want to do som ething!” she cried.
“ What can I do?”
The Inspector said soberly: “ This,
if you want to,” he said. “ I know
it’s not safe for you—”
“ S a fe !” she exclaimed almost
scornfully. “ I don’t want to be
safe, with m y mother dead, and my
father—”
“ Mr. Hurder’s in the Bowdon
house,” Tope explained. “ They aim
to keep h im there. They won’t have
a nurse in to take care of him . But
Miss Leaford, they’d have you. They
want you home, and if you went,
and insisted on nursing him—”
Clint made a swift indignant protest;
but June hushed him.
“ Yes, I understand,” she told the
m an steadily. “ I'll go. But why?
What am I to do?”
“ To watch,” he said. “ To be
ready.”
“ Ready for w h at?” she insisted.
So, reluctantly, he put the thing
in words. “ Whoever did this wants
Mr. Hurder dead,” he pointed out.
“ I think there’ll be another try at
killing h im .”
And he said gravely: “ Tt^ere
might be more than that. There
m igh t be a try at killing you.”
CH A PT E R X I II
Clint had listened to Inspector
Tope's suggestion that June return
to Kenesaw Hill with an incredulous
and angry horror. Now he cried in
a bitter wrath:
“ No! I won’t stand for that. Ju n e ’s
been through enough—”
“ We’ll be there to take care of
her,” Tope urged. “ You and I,
Clint. We’ll be on the job. I t ’s
only for tonight. I ’ve a notion tonight
will tell the tale.”
“ No,” Clint insisted. “ She’s
through with them out there, all
those people. I ’m going to be all
her fam ily from now on. I f you
think I ’m going to let her go out
there for bait, to bait a trap—” And
he cried: “ Why do you have to mix
in, Inspector? Let them wash their
own dirty linen.”
Tope urged gravely: “ I t ’s any citizen’s
duty to do what he can,
C lint.” His tone was grim. “ And
son, there’s a murderer loose out
there. Maybe a m aniac. I think
he is. There’s a terrible, m ad persistence
in h im . Or her.”
“ H er?” C lint echoed, startled by
that pronoun.
Tope hesitated. “ Him or her, whoever
it is,” he repeated. “ Clint,
whoever did this is a monster, not
human. No telling what will come
next.”
“ And you want to risk Ju n e ’s
life?”
“ I don’t aim to,” Tope argued.
“ She’ll have her eyes open. I ’ll tell
her what to watch for. She’ll
have a pistol, to use if she has to.
We’ll be right outside.” He spoke to
June herself. “ You won’t go into it
blindly,” he said. “ Nor at all, unless
you w ant.”
“ Let Heale work it out,” Clint
cried. “ I t ’s his job.”
June was a long time in taking
any part in this discussion between i
them: But when she spoke at last, !
it was decisively.
“ I don’t trust Inspector Heale, I
C lint,” ahe aaid “ If he thinks Uncle
J im —m y father—did this, he j
must be a dull, witless m an .”
They watched her; she seemed to
think aloud. “ It was money, the
money always,” she cried, half to
herself. “ I can see that now*. Everything
had to be done to keep the
money in the family. That was why
they were so furious when Mother
m arried Uncle J im —for fear some
of the money would get away from
them. Oh, I ’ve heard them talk,
and p la n !”
Clint said warmly: “ Sweet, hush!
You’re never going back there
ag ain.”
But June amiled at him , and she
said: “ Yes, I am, Clint. I can go
back and watch and see things now
that I couldn’t see before. I can
understand.”
Inspector Tope said slowly:
“ Heale is afraid of your people. He
won’t go after them hard, the way
he would after other folk. And I
never saw an uglier business. Thia
senseless, pitiless butchering!
There’s a m aniac looae out there;
and Heale won't act. I ’ve got to
find some way.”
“ I ’ll do whatever you say,” June
insisted; and Clint knew at last that
he could not dissuade the girl. He
said slowly:
“ I wish you wouldn’t, June. But
—I can see, can feel the s?me way.
Inspector, what do you mean to
d o?”
Tope considered, his eyes on the
floor, hia head wagging “ I think
the thing will ripen tonight,” he confessed.
“ If it seems sure that Mr.
Hurder will live, the murderer will
try to end him tonight.”
He watched Ju n e intently. “ And
maybe you too! I ’m guessing at I
this; but I ’m a good guesser. Some
one out there is money-crazy. Mr. ;
Hurder is a rich m an ; and some- j
one out there wants that money. I
Maybe wants it quick. Maybe has
to have it quick.
“ I ’m guessing," he repeated.
“ Justus Taine wouldn’t tell me what 1
was in the wills. But my guess is
that the Hurder money is in a trust
agreement for Mrs. Leaford—but
she’s dead—and then for you. Miss
Leaford. With trustees. Maybe
Taine himself. Maybe his sons. It
doesn't matter—wouldn’t help us
any if we knew, because they’re all
in the same pot together. But it
comes dow’n to it that you’re the
only one left in the way, Miss I l ford.
With you dead, the Hurder
money’s bound to stay in the Taine
fam ily .”
June nodded. “ Yes,” she said.
“ Yes, they could make Grandpa
Hurder write his will the way they
wanted it. They’d leave him no
peace till he did.”
“ So there it is,” Tope agreed,
with a grim simplicity. “ The money
waiting, ready to run into their
pockets as soon as Mr. Hurder dies.
You're the last d am in the way, the
last thing that holds it back. They’U
be after you.’’
“ I ’m not a fra id !” said June.

centuries ago. It was in this cell,
tradition says, that wild young Henry

his father, the fourth King Henry,
died in the Jerusalem chamber of
the abbey.
The discovery was disclosed by
Lawrence Tanner, keeper of the

the find was made during cleaning
operations on a monument in St.
Benedict’s chapel to Dr. Gabriel
Goodman, a former dean of Westminster,
who died in 1601. The monument
shows the dean kneeling at a
praying desk.
“ Behind the praying desk was
found in the stonework a little window
so placed that anyone looking
through would see the altar of the
chapel,” Tanner said.
Just to the side of monument is
a door, now blocked, which had, as
it had seemed to us for years, no

we concluded that the door led to a

“ Through that door must have

Tanner explained that the hermit
usually was an elderly monk regarded

(Run-over from first page.)
and its crops this yoar “better than
average” , the legislature advanced
measures designed to aid Wisconsin
agriculturists.
Final legislative action was taken
on a bill setting up a rural electrification
division in the department of agriculture
to which is appropriated $15.-
000 a year. It is now before Governor
Heil for signature. The division will
be charged with aiding rural electric
cooperatives in getting federal loans
and in setting up electric cooperatives
in the state.
Meanwhile the new state board of
agriculture was making clear that its
primary policy will be the promotion
of quality agricultural projects. To
facilitate the improvement in the quality
of Wisconsin’s agricultural staple
dairy produce, the board asked the
legislature to appropriate to it the
additional amount of $80,000 a year to
strengthen inspection and grading
services for the cheese and milk plants
of the state.
According to a plan in which Governor
Heil, the board, and the legislative
joint finance committee concurred, the
funds are to be deducted from the
scheduled appropriation of $1,200,000
a year for Bang’s disease indemnities
Preliminary legislative approval has
already been given to the proposal,
and its final passage is relatively certain.

From ‘Nazi Spy’ Set
If you think the Warner Bros.
Studio was kidding when it announced
that the “Confessions of a Nazi Spy”
set would be closed to all but persons
directly connected with the filming of
the picture, just listen to this:
The picture, which will show
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at
the Badger Theatre, went before the
cameras on the studio’s back lot at 9
a. m. one morning. Four uniformed
studio policemen were stationed about
a block distant from the set on the
four studio streets leading to it.
About 9:10 a. m. a tall slender man
tried to get on the set, but the policeman
wouldn’t allow him on without
pass. The man was Leon G. Turrou,
former ace G-Man, who broke up the
Nazi Spy ring in America, and who
acted as technicolor advisor during
production of “Confessions of a Nazi
Spy.”
Added Patriotic Short
Haym Solomon, one of the earliest
of American patriots, lives again
“ Sons of Liberty,” Warner Bros.’ patriotic
short in Technicolor. Starring
Claude Rains in the starring role,
“ Sons of Liberty,” is based on the life
of this Philadelphia broker and the aid
he rendered the cause for American
independence. It was he to whom
George Washington turned when food
and munitions had run low, and it
looked as though the Colonial cause
for independence was lost.
Wittenberg Defeats Aniwa
Continuing their march toward the
pennant, the Wittenberg Piolts blasted
out an easy 10 to 4 victory over Aniwa
Sunday. The Pilots took the lead
in the second inning and never lost it
throughout the game, and demonstrated
they can hit that ol’ apple. They
now lead in team batting.
Besides pitching a good steady game
for the winners, Palladeau hit one of
Malchowski fast ones over the centerfield
fence for a home run. Vance led
the Pilot attack with a triple, a double
and a single, while Storm turned in
the defensive gem of the game with a
one handed stab of Malchowski’s high
fly ball into deep right field.
Next Sunday Birnamwood comes
here with an unbroken line of defeats,
though the B’s have played some very
good games, it just has not been their
luck to win. With the pennant hanging
before their eyes, the Pilots will
not take any chances and will be out
there to win.
Come out, you fans, and boost the
Pilota to the 1939 pennant. They need
your support.

Some gentle act of love He’d do.

Sadly misled by ty*r parents ami

look upon as far short of what it
should be every Friday morning when
we chuck it into the postoffice.

By ED IT H B R A N D IS
C T U D E N T S of the hum an mind tell
us that children m ay be and
often are “ conditioned” toward resentment
and bitterness when they
are very young, by—can you believe
it?—their mothers. Later this conditioning
which is an actual change
in nerve structure is indicated by
a bad disposition, an unpleasant personality.
We say of such a person,
“ He has a chip on his shoulder.”
There will be an almost infinite
number of incidents in the early life
of almost any child, which, if wrongly
dealt with, will form fighting habits.
Let us consider a simple, understandable,
all too common example.
A little boy is making something
he calls a boat. He is happy and
intent on his piece of work. His
mother speaks to him. When he
does not respond instantly to her
bid for his attention she snatches
the toy away from his hands in a
surge of anger. She is, she thinks,
teaching her child instant obedience
to and respect for his elders. If
he is a child of spirit he, instinctively,
will respond to anger with anger.
If he cannot give vent to his resentment
at being interrupted—of
course he m u st never fight back at
Mother—he will have a thwarted
feeling associated with the breaking
of his concentration and the snatching
away of his project.
Should s im ilar incidents repeatedly
occur, the resentment he will feel
and the entire train of reactions
which w ill follow can hardly fail to
become deep-seated. They are now
involuntary—a fixed habit. When
this stage is reached, nothing but a
careful arrangement of situations in
which the child receives sympathetic
consideration and makes desirable
reactions as a na tu ra l consequence
will bring him back to norm
a l behavior.
Now there is a hopeful thing about
habit formation. If it be true that
the child m ay be and often is “ conditioned”
toward undesirable behavior,
it is also true that he may be
conditioned for peaceful, harm onious
and productive living.
Home Is First School.
The another, who is the c h ild ’s first
teacher, and his best if she be wise
and resourceful, should understand
the value of the early plans and
activities he sets up for himself.
They are his preparation for the
larger plans, greater productivity
and development of initiative when
he is older. During his moments of
intense concentration she must try
never to interfere. She must see
that a certain amount of his time
is used by and for himself without
interruption. Respect fbr his elders
may be taught him in connection
with other matters to which they
are more properly related.
The child whose individuality is
recognized and respected, whose initiative
is encouraged, will form desirable
habits of self-expression. He
will enter the world with a selfconfidence
and an inner control that
will enable him to meet his problems
with courage and competence.
Deep within himself he will know,
he will remember, that he has
planned, he has wrought, he has
achieved. To successful living there
is no greater asset than to be able to
say, “ In the past I have planned
things and made my plans come
true .” Following such a statement
will always he this: “ What I have
done I can do ag ain.”

“Death in the Eeltrap”
He l l o , e v e r y b o d y :
A fisherman takes his living out of the water, and at times
the water is pretty generous. But it’s a treacherous element
when it wants to be, and there are times when it takes back more
than it has given. Sometimes it drives a mighty hard bargain.
Judd O’Rourke, of Hartford, Conn., made his living for eight
or nine months by wheedling it from the Saco river in Maine.
Judd didn’t take any too much from the river. Darned little
•more than he needed to live on. But when the river came
around to collect, it wanted Judd’s life in payment for those few
tnonths of subsistence.
It was in the spring of 1929 when Judd started to wrest a
living from the river. He was digging clams and fishing for
eels, down at the mouth of the stream. Eel fishing took quite
a bit of equipment. One set line alone cost about eight dollars
for material and a day's work putting it together.
A set line is a long rope, with weights on it every 20 feet to keep
it down at the bottom of the river, and three or four hundred shorter
lines attached to it at intervals. The shorter lines are baited to catch
the eels which swim along near the bottom of the stream on their way
out to sea with the ebbing tide.
Set Line Anchored by Concrete Blocks.
J u d d ’s set line stretched clear across the river. It was anchored
by concrete blocks i few feet out from either shore, and at
one end there was a float that told Judd where he could And it
when he wanted it. You never take a set line entirely out of the
water. When you want to gather your catch, you haul the line
up at the buoy and work your way along it in a rowboat, pulling
the line up in front of you and letting it fall back in the water
behind.
All through April and May, Ju d d made his living digging
clams and tending his set lines. And then, on the morning of
June 7, Old Man River presented him with a bill for what he had
taken. The bill was for one hum an life, and Old Man River
didn't pull his punches when he started collecting them.
That morning, Judd and his friend, George Croft, were rowing out
to some m ud flats for bait. On their way, they passed one of Ju d d ’s
set lines and stopped to see if there was a stray eel or two on it. Judd

Chicken Dinner.
A pillar of the colored church,
Alexander Jackson, was entertaining
at dinner the pastor and some
of the prominent members. After
grace Alexander began to carve the
chicken, and the pastor waxed
facetious.

smilingly, ” do de white folks 'round

Alexander pried loose a wing.
Spotless G uatem ala City
At an altitude of about 5,000 feet
above sea level, and with a 170,000
population, Guatemala City, capital
of Guatemala, is an attractive spot
in tropical America. The name, of
In dian origin, means “ permanencyplace
of ancestors.” Of real interest
are the palaces, temples, pottery,
statues, monuments and burial
places, mysteries of dead and
gone ages. Broad streets and
snowy houses are unusually attractive,
for it is a spotless city. The
market place attracts visitors who
find most enjoyable the place where
Indians of many tribes congregate.
F or many miles, these men and
women have jogged along patiently,
bringing their handicraft and pottery
to be sold at very reasonable
figures. One m ay determine, if educated
in their tribal traditions, to

to by the aprons of the men and
the blouses of the women, each
having different weave and pattern.

Largest Canal Lock
Thc Davis lock in the Saulte
Sainte M a ne canal is not the longest

the fourth locks are 1,350 feet long
and 80 feet wide. One of the locks
i" the new Welland canal, the guard
lock at Humberstone, 1,380 feet, is
the longest in the world. There are
no locks at the Soo which will allow
two 600-foot freighters to pass
through at the same time.
George was hauling him down—not up!
caught the line at the buoy, pulled it up, and started working along it
toward the other side of the river. He worked along until he was about
half way across, and then the line stuck.
Judd figured it was caught on a snag on the river bottom.
Try as he would, he couldn't pull it up, so the two men gave up
and rowed on to get their bait. But on the way back, Judd began
thinking that he did n 't want to lose a new eight dollar set
line and decided to have a try at diving for it.
The river was only about 14 feet deep at low tide, and all the clothes
Ju d d had on were his boots and a pair of old pants with legs cut off at
the knees. He took off his boots, and then tied the boat's anchor rope
i to his waist artd gave the other end to George Croft to hold. That rope
was for safety's sake. The waters on the Maine coast are ice cold,
even in June, and if Ju d d got a cram p he wanted George to be able to
haul him up. But sometimes the contraptions we rig up for our safety
are the things that do us the most harm.
Judd Finds Where His Line Is Snagged.
Ju d d dived. He found his line and began working his way toward
where it was snagged. He found the place. An old water-logged tree
stump, rolled downstream by the current, had lodged on top of it. Judd
couldn't budge the stump. His lungs were bursting, so he rose to the
surface. The only thing he could do now was to cut the line on each
side of the stump and save as much of it as possible. Taking his Ashing
knife he dived again.
He reached the bottom, cut the line on one side, and then,
after rising to the surface for another breath of air, he went
down again. But this tim e, he miscalculated his distance. He
reached bottom on the wrong side of the stump and had to work
his way around it. "T h a t took a few precious seconds,” says
Judd, “ because now the current was becoming stronger and it
was getting increasingly hard to hold my feet on the bottom. But
>t last I found the line. I cut it quickly, doubled my knees under
me and sliot toward the surface.”
Anchor Rope Caught on Bottom.
But Ju d d d id n’t reach the surface. He shot up about flve feet, and
then stopped with a jerk that took the air out of his lungs. That jerk
scared Judd. “ The first thing J thought,” he says, “ was that a large
squid had me. To this day I don’t know why I should have thought that,
for thc largest squid I have ever seen weighed only a pound and a half.
Then I looked down and saw that it was the anchor rope, tied to my
waist, that was holding me. I knew it must be caught on the bottom, so
I grasped it and hauled myself downward, hand over hand.”
Judd's lungs were aching now. The air was gone out of them,
and he knew it would be a long time before he could untangle
that rope and get to the surface. Would he make it? Well—he
was doing his best. That 10 feet of rope seemed like 500. His
heart was beating and bis head was spinning. At last he reached
the point where the rope was snagged, and then—c a la m ity !
As he reached the snag, the rope suddenly tightened, drawing him
up close against the stump. Up in the boat, George Croft had picked
that moment to become alarm ed and try to haul Judd out of the water.
And with the rope caught in the snag, George was hauling h im down
instead of up—down to his death!
Judd began to struggle. But the rope only pulled him
closer to the stump. It was so tight that Judd couldn't possibly
free it from the snag, and there weren't many more seconds
left in which he'd be able to free it. His lungs were bursting
and his stomach felt as if it were turning inside out. He began
swallowing water—and at that moment he thought of the knife he
had brought down to cut the set line. It was in his belt, lie got
It out. cut the rope— and that was the last Judd remembered.
When Ju d d woke up, he was lying in the bottom of the boat, and
George was giving him artificial respiration. George had had the scare
of his life when the rope suddenly went slack and Ju d d ’s body had come
to the surface and then started to go down again. He had fished Judd
out with a gaff and then worked over him until he brought him around

Despondency caused August F.
Grosskopf, 62, to take his own life
early Sunday morning, when he stood
over a dynamite blast which tore part
of his body to pieces. He was found
by Albert H enfer, near whose place
the tragedy occurred. The Grosskopfs
reside on a farm about two miles
northwest o f Caroline.
The deceased had appeared despondent
fo r some time. The day before
the tragedy he had been in Marion,
where it is believed he purchased the
dynamite which he used to end his
life. His fam ily stated that Sunday
morning he arose early and, as usual,
did the chores and returned to the
house to eat a hearty breakfast. They
noticed that he seemed deeply concerned
and that he mentioned often
that the heat was getting him. Shortly
before 7:00 o’clock he left the
house and headed fo r the field, his
fam ily believing that he was going
about some o f the work on the farm .
His neighbor saw him walking up the
road and later cross over onto his own
land. He was carrying a pail. Grosskopf
had placed the dynamite on a
red granite stone and must have leaned
over the stone in order to get the
full force o f the blast. Part o f his
face, chest and hand were torn away.
Coroner Leonard H artw ig was notified
immediately and assisted in the
investigation.
Mr. Grosskopf was born and reared
in the town of Grant and was a wellknown
farm er there. He leaves his
wife, Mabel, and five children, Otto,
25; Herbert, 21; LuVerna, 16; F lorence,
15; and June, 9; besides several
brothers and sisters.
Funeral services were conducted on
Wednesday at the Grosskopf home
and burial was in the church cemetery
at Caroline.

W e wish to thank all who have helped in any
w ay to make our annual festival this year the
success it has been. Individuals and organizations
have been generous in th eir g ifts o f money
to us. so that the “ Fest Fund” has grown to
such a size that it w ill help us considerably in
the payment o f the bills fo r m ajor repairs this
summer. I f there are some o f you, who would
still like to contribute to that Fest offering, we
w ant to assure you that it is not too late yet.
W e w ill be very happy to receive w hatever you
may see fit to send.
W e wish also to thank those who responded
in such a fine w ay to our request fo r material
fo r this Fest issue o f the paper. I am sure that
this issue w ill interest all o f our readers very
much. I know there are some who w ill be sorry
that none o f the form er residents o f our Home
w rote N orw egian letters. Some day, w ith this
start, we hope to have a more complete record
o f the form er residents o f Homme Childrens
Home so we may know what they are doing and
w here th ey have established homes o f th eir
own. A special thank you to those who sent us
letters o f greetings.
Most o f all, we want to thank those who so
kindly accepted our invitations to take part on
the program . Usually, when a pastor accepts
such an invitation fo r Sunday programs, it
means that a vacation day is taken fo r that
purpose. So, to you, Rev. Dale, Rev. Masted, and
R ev. Stolen, a most hearty thank you.
M ay the festival day create w ithin us a new
desire to praise our Lord fo r the w ay in which
He has seen fit to prosper the work Rev. Homme
started. M ay our zeal be quickened so that we
rejoice in doing a little o f the Lord ’s work
w herever we m ay happen to live.
Sincerely, R. L . Lokensgard.
Minneapolis, Minnesota.
T o the Friends o f the Homme Childrens Hom e:
In view that you again w ill gath er fo r the A n nual
Festival at the Home, may I send you the
sincere and hearty thanks o f the Church fo r the
love and aid that you have given to the Home
during these years. Through your gifts, your
prayers and your love this Home has administered
to many a child that otherw ise would have
been homeless. M ay H is words. ‘ ‘ Inasmuch as
y e have done it unto the least o f these, ye have
done it unto Me” , be your constant inspiration
and encouragement to continue in this service.
M ay God’s blessing rest upon the children
who go in and out o f this Home as well as all of
those who are seeking to care fo r them.
Sincerely yours. J. A . Aasgaard.
President o f the N orw egian
Lutheran Church o f America.
Chicago, Illinois.
T o the Friends o f the Homme Childrens Hom e:
I greet you in the Nam e o f the Children’s
F rien d ! He said. “ L et the little children come
unto m e". He identifies H im self w ith the least
o f the distressed and afflicted. W hat we do fo r
them we do fo r Him. Christ is loving and helping
these children through you. Thus you are
fulfilling His command, “ L et them come unto
me.”
Some o f these little ones have been robbed o f
the jo y o f being children. E very child’s heart
is hungry fo r love. But some o f these little
folks have been robbed o f th eir birth righ t o f
love. W hat greater tragedy can there be than
th a t! The result is that some times they become
a bit hard even in the tender years o f
childhood.
M ay the Lord gran t a large measure o f the
mind o f Christ to the members o f the staff and
to all who deal w ith these children and g ive you
ftcr Wnmmrl on llitfl
grace to mend th eir broken lives. God help you
to be patient and kind, even if some times they
are not loveable. W e must try to look at them
w ith the eyes o f Jesus who loves and yearns for
them all.
May the Homme Children s Home never lack
friends who will be generous contributors and
fa ith fu l intercessors!
W ith Christian greetings all, I am.
Sincerely, M artin Anderson,

Dear frien d Lokensgard:
In a few short weeks it w ill be time fo r your
annual Fall-festival again. M ay we join with
your large host o f friends and wish you and
Mrs. Lokensgard. your co-workers, and the boys
and g irls a blessed day.
W e are very happy in our new home anti new
field o f labor, yet it is but natural that there
often come to mind memories o f the days we
spent at Homme H om e; and not least the annual
F all-festivals.
Through its department o f Charities, our
Church aims to serve in a special w ay, and as it
is privileged to bring com fort, hope and cheer,
to old and young in His Nam e, it would go fo rward
in that calm assurance that He who has
so richly blessed w ill continue to be its God of
Love and Friend o f ‘‘ L ittle Children” . And in
this work Homme Orphan Home has had a large
part. T o many it has been a Home and it is our
sincere wish and prayer that it may continue to
serve fo r years to com e; to be a Home, w ith all
that that beautiful term implies, a home on
earth pointing to Home above T o that end may
God bless your labors.
Sincerely,
Rev. anti Mrs. E. G. Stolen anti fam ily.
W ittenberg, Wisconsin.
Friends o f the Homme Children’s H om e:
In compliance with the request o f the editor
o f “ F or Gammel og U n g.” I am glad o f the
opportunity to relate recollections from the time
I was a boy at Homme Orphan Home, while the
founder, the late Rev. E. J. Homme, was still in
active charge o f the institution.
I and tw o sisters and a brother, Ida. Clara
and G odfrey (b etter known as F re d ), spent
several years o f the eighties and early nineties
at the Home, com ing here from Hancock, Minnesota.
During most o f this time. Adolph, an
oltier brother, matle his home with relatives in
Minnesota. Our father. Adolph Frederick Englund,
was a native o f Sweden, where he had attended
Upsala U n iversity, and came to this
country and to Minnesota in the sixties. He
clerked fo r a tim e fo r Mr. Aaker. well known
pioneer merchant in Alexandria, about 45 miles
north o f Hancock, operated a store for some
tim e in O ttertail C ity, worked fo r the well
known Wollan fam ily, merchants in Glenwood,
where I was born, then went to Hancock and
opened the first store there a fter the coming of
the railroad, then called the St. Paul, Minneapolis
and Manitoba, and was postmaster o f Hancock
from the tim e it was first established in
1875 until he died early in 1884. Our mother's
maiden name was Olava Solum and she was the
daughter o f N orw egian emigrants from Telemarken
who had first lived in Iowa before settlin
g on a farm near Alexandria. She died from
typhoid fe ve r in 1881. So when fath er died
three years later from appendicitis (th ey then
said it was “ inflammation o f the bowels” ) anti
left us children orphans, the decision by relatives
to send fou r o f us to the orphanage here
was arrived at in this w a y : A friend and neighbor
o f fath er and mother, one o f the few N o rwegians
in Hancock, and who had come there
from Waupun, advised the relatives to send us
here so that we m ight be kept togeth er and be
brought up in the Lutheran church. He knew
R ev. Homme, who at one time served the Waupun
congregation, and had learned o f Rev.
Homm e’s establishment o f a home fo r orphans
at this place.
So one fine day in June o f 1884, we were on
our way to W ittenberg. The place was first
named Carbonero, but was changetl upon the
special request o f Rev. Homme when he came
Un Wdmmrl on linn
here to establish his charitable home. An uncle
accompanied us as fa r as Minneapolis. There
w e were met by Rev. Homme, who hail come to
that city to take us the rest o f the w ay. To get
here by train those days from Minneapolis, we
had to go by w ay o f La Crosse and Tomah to get
to Wausau and then to W ittenberg. A few hours
out o f Minneapolis, a man got aboard the train
and rode all the w ay w ith us to W ittenberg. It
was the Rev. L. M. Biorn, o f Zumbrota, the well
known pioneer minister o f Goodhue county,
Minnesota, who was making the trip here to get
married to Mathilda Johnson, sister o f the w ife
o f a Mr. Hazard, who was then station agent
here, and o f Rev. Christian Bestul. A rriv in g in
Wausau in the evening o f the 24th, we spent
the night at the Opdahl boarding house. In the
afternoon o f the follow ing day we landed here
in W ittenberg. N ever will I forget the thrill o f
coming from the open Minnesota prairie country
into a magnificent primeval hardwood forest. A t
that time there was only a small clearing with
a few buildings in the town just recently established
upon the coming o f the railroad through
this territo ry a few years before. That first
evening, at the edge o f the clearing across the
track from the Home, I saw the camp fire o f
Indians who were livin g in tents, and that was
also a th rill I shall never forget.
Rev. Homme was a man with much executive
ability, enterprise, and initiative. W ithin a few
years a fte r starting the orphanage here, and
the year follow ing our arrival, he built and
equipped a plant fo r the printing o f "F o r Gammel
og U ng,” which had been done in Chicago
fo r several years. I was among the three boys
that he picked to work in the printing office and
to learn the trade. W e w ere placed under the
care o f J. O. Johnson, a man from Decorah,
Iowa, who had learned his trade in Copenhagen,
Denmark, fo r apprenticeship. Mr. Johnson was
a kindly and considerate man. but very careful
in holding us to the same strict rules that prevailed
in his own apprenticeship in Copenhagen.
One o f his rules (how well we remember that
and others) was that there was not to be any
talking between us boys during the ten hours o f
the day we w ere at the case setting type. N o
stools were tolerated at the case fo r sittin g
down on and no resting o f one foot on the bottom
brace o f the stand was allowed; we were
expected at all times to stand with both feet
squarely on the box we as boys were obliged to
use in order to reach the cases conveniently.
This standing all day w ith very little m oving
about was tiresome, but we soon got used to it.
The foreman was conscientious in instructing us
properly in every operation o f straight typesetting
and in other phases o f plain letter press
printing. Mr. Johnson went back to Decorah
a fter a short time and he was followed by
Charles Erickson, who had charge o f the office
fo r many years. He was also a good boss,
and what we well remember about him is that
he was a painstaking and conscientious man in
his work, and treated us boys very well while
holding us strictly, as Johnson had done, to the
rules and routine duties in the office.
There was a large amount o f printing done
in the Home prin ting office, in the line o f periodicals
and books, so we were kept busy every
day o f the year. And Rev. Homme, who edited
and arranged copy and illustrations for the several
papers issued and the books printed, had
plenty o f work in connection therewith in addition
to all the work he had in managing the
Home as well as acting as pastor o f tw o congregations.
N ow many years later we marvel at
Rev. Homme’s capacity fo r work, his remarkable
initiative, practical nature and unfailing
energy. During the 22 years that he labored
here, believe it or not, this is what he did in the
w ay o f constructive w o rk : F irst creating a site
in the heavy forest, he built a parsonage, and
the first main building o f the institution; very
soon a fte r completing these tw o buildings he
erected a tw o-story school building and a year
or so later made a large addition to the main
building; he put up the rather large building in
which he was to house the prin ting office: about
this time he was supervising the erection o f a
large building on Mission hill, the first and main
building o f Bethany Indian Mission, in the establishment
o f which he had an important p a r t;
Rev. Homme was instrumental in the establishment
o f an academy (calling it a Normal
School) here in the latter part o f the eighties,
the principal o f which was Prof. Knute Lokensgard
(uncle o f the present manager o f the
Homme Children's H om e), who was assisted by
P rof. P. J. Eikeland. later head o f the Scandinavian
department at St. O laf College. The
Rev. George T a y lor R ygh later joined the faculty.
Quite a number o f young people from N orwegian
settlements nearby attended the school,
conducted at first in buildings o f the children’s
home. For the better accommodation o f
classes. Rev. Homme later built a three-story
addition (shown at the top right hand corner o f
first p ag e). The school was later moved to St.
Ansgar, Iowa. In the early part o f the nineties.
Rev. Homme built a dam across the river which
flowed through the forties o f tim ber land he
owned about a mile north o f W ittenberg, then
erected a sawmill, in which he cut most o f the
lumber that was used in the large three-story

pulpit and baptism al font, w ere acquired in
the same w ay . A lw a y s putting one iron in the
fire a fte r another, w ith indefatigable enterprise,
he strangely never seemed hurried or harassed,
m aking every move count. H e w as m arvelously
systematic and methodical in the use of the 16
to 18 hours o f the day that he w as awake. F o r
instance, if he went down town to attend to the
m any m atters that arose fo r his attention, he
never returned to his office w ith an y item fo rgotten
on the errand. E a rly in the morning
every day, he w as up and around planning the
work to be done on the acres he w as having
cleared and cultivated. A n d late into the night
he w as usually seen at his desk attending to his
correspondence and other office work or preparing
a sermon. One winter, Rev. Hom m e even
found time to have a class in Germ an one evening
a week and also conducted a L u th er H our
once a week. H e w as fluent in the use of G e rman,
fo r he had taken his theological course
under Dr. C. F. W . W a lth er at Concordia Seminary
in St. Louis a fte r his graduation from
Lu th er College.
Several thousand dollars, money which his
w ife had inherited from her father, M r. Swenholt,
a pioneer fa rm e r near Scandinavia, was
the greater part of the amount that he used fo r
buyin g about ten forties o f land here in the
beginning and startin g his institution.
The cares Rev. Hom m e w as under in getting
enough money to carry on the work afte r he had
once started were, indeed, heavy. H e w as often
obliged to take trips to congregations and individuals
here and there to solicit contributions.
A t one time, hearing o f a well-to-to man in
Illinois, who w as said to be in sym pathy with
the w ork of the pioneering N orw egian Lutheran
church. Rev. Homme went to see him about a
loan of a thousand dollars without interest.
A ft e r introducing him self and explaining his
errand, the man told Rev. Homme he would
think about the m atter and let him know later.
Rev. Homme returned home in the belief that
his request had been made in vain, but a short
time later he opened a letter in his m orning’s
mail that contained a thousand dollar d raft as
an outright g ift from the Illinois man and a request
that Rev. H om m e refrain from givin g him
credit fo r the gift in the list usually printed in
“ F or Gammel og U n g ” in acknowledgement of
g ifts received fo r the Home. Rev. Homme, who
w as a deeply religious and devout man. w as so
overcome w ith joy that he burst out in song,
singing one of his favorite hymns. A s w e remember,
from the annual reports in the "K alen -
der.” from fou r to five thousand dollars a year
w as required to run the Home. A considerable
part o f this amount came from the revenues of
the printing-office and from the proceeds of the
farm . The rem ainder came from frien ds o f the
institution, all over the N orth w est, w ho were
quite generous with gifts. T he Home had come
to be widely known because o f the publicity
given to it by the papers Rev. Homme published,
and besides it had a w arm place in the hearts of
the people because o f the fact that it w as the
first charitable institution established am ong
the N orw egian s in Am erica.
To me Rev. Homme appeared to be a little
rfor fflatnmtl o r It** 517
ahead o f a number o f fellow ministers, especially
those who w ere born and had been educated
in N orw ay. H e believed that English should
have a prominent place as a medium o f instruction
in the school o f the Home and in the daily
lives o f the children and the personnel. Quite a
b it o f the output from the prin tin g office was
also in English. That is perhaps why he employed
two men o f English and Scotch descent,
who did not understand a word o f N orw egian,
at different times as teacher and disciplinarian.
One o f these. Adolph Blandin, o f N ew London,
later came to occupy a prominent place in the
school system o f St. Paul. The oth er was James
McClellan, also o f N ew London. I happen to
know that Rev. Homme was criticised fo r this
attitude by certain pastors (som ethin g that
m ight have been expected at the tim e and under
the circumstances) and that R ev. Homme replied
that since English was the language the
boys and girls would be using in th eir associations
a fte r leaving the Home, he was anxious
that they should become proficient in the use o f
it, which, a fte r all, was the coun try’s language.
Other members o f the personnel in the early
days o f the Home, whose names now come to
mind, were Jacob Lunde, Mr. Midtboe, Elisa K ittelson
(related to the Dahle fam ily in Mt.
Horeb, where she is still liv in g ), T . H. Haugan
(later pastor in Northfield. Minnesota, now deceased,
whose w ife was the fo rm er Hilda Erhardt,
o f this village, and whose son is Randolph
E. Haugan, m anager o f A u gsbu rg Publishing
House), the late L u d vig Slotten. N . S. Hassel,
who came here from Georgia, w here he was a
consul; Mrs. M artha Fuglebak, now in Fergus
Falls, M innesota: Lena Johnson. John Aas. Miss
Goli. from Dane county, who lost her life in
Madison by being hit by a train at a Madison
railroad crossing, Jens Aarbak. o f Houston,
Minnesota, Miss Benjaminson, o f W iota, and
Mrs. Fredrickson.
Incidents we wish to relate to throw some
light on what sort o f a man R ev. Homme w as:
One o f the form er boys o f the Hom e had come
from Manitowoc, where he was employed by the
Madson Seed company, one third o f July evening
to spend the Fourth here. He called on
Rev. Homme at the office. A ft e r the tw o had
talked togeth er fo r a while, R ev. Homme told
the boy that when he got ready to turn in he
could share the bed w ith him. even though he
knew it was an easy m atter fo r the boy to find
a place to sleep w hile he was here w ith any one
o f his many friends in the boys’ dorm itory.
Rev. Homme was a b ig man, w eigh in g well over
200 pounds, and his bed was a single or narrow
one, but that did not deter R ev. Homme from
offerin g the boy to share the bed w ith him on a
hot summer night. That was the kind o f man
he was, not standing on his dign ity and not
afraid to incur personal discom fort to please one
o f his boys. A n oth er time. Congressman Stew art,
o f Wausau, was visitin g Rev. Homme in his
office. Mr. Stew art said to Rev. Homme that
he expected shortly to return to Washington,
whereupon Rev. Homme said that he would like
to have his daughter, refe rrin g to one o f the
three daughters still at home, obtain a job at
housework in W ashington fo r the experience
and the larger outlook she would get in that
w ay. The congressman was shocked to hear
th at Rev. Homme should think o f having his
daughter work as a domestic, and we shall say
that Rev. Homme, who had a wholesome view
o f life, was just as much shocked to find his
congressman look upon housework in that light.
Am on g the old people at the Home in the
early days were an old Swedish couple, who had
come here from Canada. The man was a fine
old gentleman who spent much o f the tim e in
the woodshed splitting and piling up wood. H e
was a fa vorite w ith the boys, fo r he had a very
pleasant disposition. H is w ife died and not long
a fte r she was laid to rest in the cemetery, he
passed away. Rev. Homme then told me that
Nilsson, which was the man's name, at one time
had been the official executioner o f Sweden, a
fa ct which he was now free to reveal and which
he had kept a secret while the couple was livin g
under a pledge made when they entered the
Home. Many years later, a fte r F had almost
forgotten what Rev. Homme had told me about
Nilsson, m y w ife discovered that a sterling
silver spoon in the collection she had received
from her mother bore an inscription that corroborated
the story about Nilsson and reads
as follows in Swedish. “ T ill Riittaren C. G.
Nilsson.” which in English is "T o the executioner.
etc.” How a kind old gentleman like
Nilsson, the very opposite o f the type one would
expect to find in an executioner, should ever
have been called upon to do such work, is most
puzzling. It is our theory th at fo r some reason
or other Nilsson was drafted by the government
fo r this duty, and that he, abhorring it and
wishing to get away from it, managed to flee
the country to Canada and finally find a haven
in W ittenberg.
When Rev. Homme was obliged to absent
him self from the Home on trips that took him
away fo r the night o r several days, his mind
was filled with anxiety about how things were
coming along at home, fo r there was always
the possibility o f some m isfortune that m ight
befall any one o f his large fam ily o f child
vur Wnintnrl an linn
ren and old people, numbering usually nearly a
hundred people. Especially in the w inter time,
when there was a lire goin g in as many as forty
stoves, and fu lly that many lamps burning,
there was the danger o f fire breaking out, in
view o f the fact that several o f these stoves
and lamps were in the care o f old people
in their dotage. The main building never caught
fire but once, when an incipient blaze was quickly
put out. But in a period o f a few years, the
tw o-story school building, the prin ting office
and the parsonage with its three-story addition
(w hich was housing the printing office at the
tim e) caught fire and burned down, the first two
in the latter part o f the nineties, and the last
one in 1903. These fires w ere Ijard blows to Rev.
Homme, for he lost his printing equipment
tw ice and many valuable and prized books and
other personal effects. Rev. Homme was in
Wausau at the tim e o f the last fire which was
the hardest blow o f all, fo r he was suffering
w ith diabetes at the time and was on his w ay to
see a doctor at Merrill when the blow struck.
A n oth er calam ity was when an epidemic o f
diphtheria came to the Home in the summer o f
1895. claim ing the lives o f six children. The institution
was quarantined and Rev. Homme
him self spent many an all-night vig il at the bedsides
o f children stricken w ith the disease.
The fatefu l summer w ith its worries, trials
and adversities lasting fo r months had much
to do, we believe, with his fallin g a prey to
th e kidney disease that finally ended his life.
The fire that came early in 1903 was almost the
final blow. He was obliged to take to his bed
soon a fte r and died on the 23rd day o f June that
year, a fter having willed practically all his
property to the N orw egian Lutheran Church o f
A m erica on condition that the Church continue
the work he had begun and carried on so successfully
here. He was nearly 60 years old at
the time o f his death.
A truly great man passed away on that June
day. He was one o f the finest contributions
N orw egian im migrants have made to their
adopted country in the past hundred years.
His w ife, who had assisted him faith fu lly
during the years o f his labors here, passed away
at the home o f her daughter, Inga. Mrs. E. J.
T orvie, in Electra, Texas, in 1925, and her grave
adjoins that o f her husband in the F irst Luth eran
churchyard here. T h eir children are living
in the follow ing places: W illiam , in Brea,
C aliforn ia: Clara, here: Inga is now in Minneapolis;
Carl, in M ilwaukee: Frank, in Electra,
M artin, in Reedsport, O regon; Anna, the youngest
daughter, died a few years ago at the last
named place. Gerhard, the youngest son, died
in 1896.
I fe a r that I am taxing the patience o f the
editor in brin gin g this sketch to such length,
but I beg his indulgence and that o f the readers
fo r a little more space fo r acquainting old
friends who may read this o f what has happened
to m yself and brothers and sisters in the
tim e that has elapsed since th ey last saw us
nearly 50 years ago.
For a couple o f years a fte r Ida and I left together
in August, 1892, I worked in St. Paul
newspaper and job offices. Then I came back
and worked fo r nearly tw o years in the Home
printing office. In the fall o f 1895, a fte r taking
special studies to qu alify as a freshm an at
St. O laf College, I entered that school, where I
studied fo r two years, finishing the sophomore
yea r in the spring o f 1897. Returning here that
spring. I was again employed in the Home prin ting
office, and the follow in g year was married
to Miss Clara Homme. I became forem an o f the
office and then in 1906 I and Just Johnson and
M artin Homme bought the local newspaper. The
Enterprise, from I. R. N ye, fath er o f Gerald I’ .
N ye, senator from N orth Dakota. Y ears later
I acquired sole possession o f the business in
which I am still engaged, assisted by son Luther
and daughter Ruth. Some years ago, the voters
o f Shawano and Outagam ie counties gave me a
seat in the state senate, where I served fo r four
years, at the end o f which tim e I did not seek
the office again fo r the simple reason I could not
afford it. The Church has entrusted me w ith
the responsibility o f serving on the board o f
directors o f the Homme Home fo r the Aged.
Ida finished the Alexandria high school, went
to St. Cloud N orm al School fo r a while, Carleton
College in Northfield and Minnesota State U niversity.
She taught fo r a time in a private
boarding school in St. Paul and in the high
school in Duluth and in other places, and was
then married to Cleve W. Van Dyke, o f A lexan dria.
T h eir home is in Miami. Arizona, where
he has extensive interests. They have one
daughter. Cleve is a brother o f the late Carl
Van Dyke, form er congressman from St. Paul,
and o f A rth u r Van Dyke, St. Paul’s present
postmaster. Th ey also happen to be cousins o f
mine fo r their m other was a Solum and a sister
o f mother.
Fred is a graduate o f St. O laf college. A fte r
finishing there in 1899, he was superintendent
o f schools o f Douglas county in Minnesota fo r a
few years and ran a newspaper in northern M innesota
fo r a time. H e was married to Bessie
Conkey, o f Hammond, Indiana, while in Douglas
county. H e was manager o f a daily paper in
nor (tiummtl
Miami, Arizona, fo r several years before moving
to Hollywood, where he has made his home
fo r the last eighteen years. He has four children.
three sons and one daughter.
Clara attended the Lutheran Ladies’ Seminary
in Ked W in g a fte r leaving here and also attended
the St. Cloud Normal School, where she
finished to qu alify herself fo r the teaching profession,
w hich she has since followed. She has
taken postgraduate courses at C alifornia and
W ashington state universities. H er home is in
Miami w ith her sister Ida.
W e were enabled to attend school w ith inheritances
le ft to us by father, the interest of
which, 1 understand, was used in partly defraying
the expenses o f our stay at the orphan
home.
Adolph (w h o was at the orphanage fo r a
short tim e) was w ith his grandparents on the
farm until th ey died and fo r several years since
then has been livin g w ith an aunt, Mrs. Lizzie
Hollister, at Nelson, Minnesota.
Finally I want to say that 1 am glad that I
received m y early training in R ev. Homme’s
institution; that I could enter an environment
dominated by the strong, Christian personality
o f Rev. Homme was a privilege in my life which
I appreciate more and more with the passing o f
years.
Sincerely. John Englund.

Dear Mr. Lokensgard:
I will do m y best to mention the personal
historical events as I recall them.
I was born in Red W ing, Minnesota, o f N o rwegian
parents on March 15, 1877, as I recall,
and at the age o f 2 years my fa th er died, and
mother w ith three children. I being the youngest,
em igrated to D ay county. South Dakota,
where she took a homestead o f 160 acres and
where we resided fo r five years when my sister,
Clara Onstad, age 9, and I. age 7 years, left the
homestead fo r Homme Orphan Home at W itten berg,
Wisconsin, we both livin g there fo r 7
years, leaving in the year 1891 when 1 was 14
years old.
O f course the high light o f my sojourn at
the Home was the opportunity o f m eeting my
sweetheart, now my wife. Emma Anderson, who
was, togeth er with her sister, Clara, the first
two girls to arrive at the Home.
The memories o f the first few years after
our arrival are rather hazy, but the three years
preceding our departure stand out rather clearly.
at least in some particulars; we had the pleasure
and profit o f attending the Academ y with
such men as P ro f. Eikeland, Knute Lokensgard,
on ltnfl 519
and George T aylor Rygh, as instructors, and 1
found later in life that the tw o years w ith these
men paid repeated dividends, as I believe all
the boys and girls who had the same privilege
as I can testify.
The outstanding date and the turning point
o f my ambitions is July 13th, 1890, when, in
company with tw o o f the other boys, do not now
remember who they were, were jum ping a
freig h t train at the depot, when I fell under and
thereby lost a leg, o f which I had one too many.
Dr. Puchner, who was near by, came over and
g ave first aid, and a fte r Dr. Finney o f Clintonville
arrived, they succeeded in synchronizing a
strong back with a weak mind, and convalescing,
came to realize that I could not th ereafter
depend upon a strong back fo r the future daily
bread, and as one o f the boys on a visit to my
bedside remarked that any fam ily life fo r me
was now lost, he knowing, as everyone at the
Home did, including. Rev. Homme, o f the boy
and girl friendship o f Emma and me, but we
have fooled him, and peculiar as it may seem,
we have surprised ourselves.
L ea vin g the Home in the year 1891 and
goin g back to the same homestead in South
Dakota that I had le ft 7 years before, we all
realized that a boy on crutches was no good on
a farm, so I was advised to attend a country
school about 1 mile distant, where, a fte r questioning,
the teacher advised me that she could
not teach the subjects that I had not had at the
Academ y, so we got our heads togeth er and decided
that if the teacher could not teach me anything.
why should I not also teach. A fte r coming
to this conclusion, a trip resulted to the
county seat, 22 miles distant, and a fte r an interview
w ith the County Superintendent I was
granted a permit to teach until the next teacher’s
examination, and consequently at 14 years
o f age I began teaching a country school at $30
per month, out o f which §2.50 per week was paid
out fo r board and room, and that when labor
was paid $15 per month and was glad to get
work at that.
The hardest w ork that I have been induced to
perform was the attem pt to teach children who
could speak neither English nor N orwegian, the
only languages in which I could make m yself
understood, but the two years o f German that
Eikeland had pounded into me at the Academy
came in handy and with the pupils try in g to
make me understand th eir German and I attem
pting to make them understand my English,
I believe we all received a benefit, and the expressions
inadvertently made by us would bring
good money as the script fo r a comic strip in
today’s funnies.

This is no love story, but must relate that
Emma and I were m arried on M ay 25, 1900, at
Minneapolis, where we met, she com ing from
Illinois and I from South Dakota, fo r the purpose,
and w e have lived happily ever after. W e
have fou r children, tw o boys and tw o girls, and
i f 1 should start in telling about them, I surely
would not finish this in time. The tw o girls are
m arried, one to Oscar G. Christianson and lives
in the same town as we do, and the youngest
g irl to Dr. I L. Jaynes, at Hardin, Montana; the
oldest son. Chester E. Onstad, is a law yer and
is connected w ith the Justice Department at
Washington, D. C., and the youngest son, L y le
J. Onstad, is single and a graduate o f Luth er
College, Decorah, Iowa, and is a M iddler at
Lu th er Theological Seminary at St. Paul, Minn.,
and this summer is exercisin g the functions o f
a student in the Parish served by O. John Nesheim
at De Soto, W is. So, notwithstanding the
prophecy to the contrary, we have enjoyed a
fam ily life, where love, affection and respect
have reigned supreme.
Emma’ s sister Clara m arried T. N . Dale, a
form er student at the Academ y some time prior
to our m arriage, and they now live near Mount
Vernon. Washington, where we have had the
pleasure o f making a visit the past fe w summers.
M y sister Clara m arried Ive r J. Johnson
about in the y ea r 1896 and now live on a farm
near Hanley, Sask., Canada.
W ithou t looking over the list o f boys at the
Home at the tim e I cannot recall but the fe w
who we w ere most frien dly with, that is John
Englund, M ikkel and Mads Mikkelson and Fred
Homme, who were all about our age.
W e live in Pow der R iv er County, Montana,
o f which Broadus is the county seat, where I am
in the practice o f law, having been admitted
to practice in the year 1915, and have been fo r
the past six years and now the County A ttorn ey
o f the County, the foundation fo r which I received
at the Home, coupled with the experience
in the several occupations prior to admission,
such as bookkeeper in a general store, bank,
grain elevator and flour mill, dairyman, fann er,
cashier o f bank, clerk o f court and lumber yard
manager.
During our stay at the Home fo r some reason
we had a fe w Indian boys at the Home, one
o f which I remember, his name was Jefferson,
w ith whom I was very frien dly and would be
glad to know his whereabouts and circumstances.
A t that tim e the tim ber was close up to the
clearing wherein the buildings w ere and thick
tim ber and brush not fa r out, some o f us boys
w ere out in the woods at what we called “ One
Mile H ill” picking raspberries when a bear stood
up in the middle o f the berry patch where we
w ere and it grunted out a “ W o o f” , and i f a
stop watch had been held on the mile run we
boys made from that hill home, it would be
the fastest mile run by a human or beast.
The b iggest change that we have noticed in
the several visits to the Home since has been
the rem oval and receding o f the tim ber line;
trees in the early days were felled that one log
made o f it would hardly find room on the bunkers
o f the log g in g shed, and the several mills in
W itten b erg w ere then a busy place. L u d vig
Slotten was the boss farm er and he was a great
fa vo rite w ith us boys. Mads Madson was the
song leader (klok k er) at the church services,
and a m igh ty voice did he have and w ith him
at the h*lm w e didn’t need to w orry i f we w ere
o ff key as no one could hear it anyway. The
church was on a hill a short w ay from the Home
and Rev. Homme conducted the services there
as well as some ou tlying communities.
W e have kept in touch w ith the Home and
its activities at all times since leaving, both
through the news items in “ F or Gammel og
U n g ” and correspondence, and think o f the
Home as our Home and the boys and g irls that
w ere then there as our brothers and sisters and
believe that all the boys and girls feel the same
way, and would suggest that a list be published
o f each Confirmation class, w ith th eir addresses,
if known, from the beginning o f the Hom e to
the present day, and upon inquiry it w ill be
j found that all o f them have at all times been
good Am erican and Christian men and women,
(w h at would make it more interesting would be
their pictures as w ell.)
W ith love and affection to you all, w e are.
Yours sincerely,
L u d vig Onstad and w ife.

To Friends o f Homme Childrens H om e:
I, Mrs. M artin Jacobsen (A n n a F .gge), was
born in Alpena, Michigan, March 24, 1881. M y
m other died when I was 41/2. leavin g m y dad
w ith three children. Dad hired a housekeeper
to attend to us until I was 7i/2. M y tw o brothers,
G eorge and Arthu r, w ere placed w ith a
farm er by the name o f Gullickson. In the summ
er o f 1887, m y father, Hans E gge, brought me
to the Homme Childrens Home. F ath er had a
great deal o f interest fo r this Home, as he knew
it w’as built on a religious foundation. H e therefore
trusted that I would be well cared for. M y
aunt from Alpena, Mrs. An drew E gge, prepared
me fo r the trip— g ivin g me a lot o f nice new
3»r Wnmmtl afl linfl 521
clothes, and also a brand new doll, which was
really the pride o f my life. A ft e r m aking the
trip by train we were greeted by R ev. and Mrs.
Homme, and 1 was then le ft in charge o f one of
the older girls, whose orders I was to obey. It
was at that time a rule that the children were
to stay at the Home until they w ere 18. Rev.
Homme advised m y fa th er to pay fo r my keeping
so that he m ight take me out whenever he
saw fit. A fte r I had been there fo r a short
while an incident occurred which I will never
forget. The girl, whose care I was under, called
me one evening and as I did not appear at once
I was subject to some form o f punishment. She
then told me that I wasn’t allowed to have more
than 1 2 piece o f bread fo r breakfast. Being
rather small, I misunderstood, and didn’t take
more than i '■> piece o f bread fo r each meal fo r
almost a week. W hen the g irl found this out,
she apologized and then took me to the kitchen
and I was then treated to a real meal. Each
child had her special duty to perform each day.
Cleaning the knives, forks and spoons w ith the
powder obtained from rubbing tw o pieces o f
brick together, was m y job. Then, o f course,
as I grew older other tasks were given me.
When the dishes had to be done, a tub was
placed on tw o low benches, and a g irl on either
side o f the tub washed, others wiped and still
others put them in th eir respective places.
A fte r the breakfast dishes w ere done, our beds
had to be made. The two girls sleeping togeth er
made th eir own beds. Our m attresses were
filled w ith corn husks. In order to make them
appear nice and even, there w as an opening
about tw o feet long in the middle o f each one.
This slit enabled us to work the husks so they
would be level. I wonder if Clara Homme (M rs.
John Englund) remembers one m orning when
she was making her bed. A s she was doing so
she lost her ring in the corn husks. The whole
mattress filling was emptied on the floo r and
some o f us little girls w ere busy hunting fo r it.
I happened to be lucky enough to find it and was
rewarded by her love. I mustn’t forget to mention
our most important job that had to be done
during the week. This included folding, labeling,
wrapping, and m aking ready the papers
that were sent out from the Home, such as the
Sunday School papers and “ F or Gammel og
U ng.” The latter had quite a few subscribers
then, now we hope the number is nearly doubled.
It took us small children almost a week to do
what the machinery o f today does in less than
h alf the time. On Christmas Eve, o f one je a r
especially, we fo rgo t all about our usual supper
and feasted almost entirely on the Christmas
goodies that had been sent to the Home. I ’ll bet
more than one little girl had a tummy ache that
night. A s I remember— one 4th o f July, we had
our picnic on the very grounds that the Orphan
Home now stands. A s I look back, I remember
how much jo y it gave us with our lemonade and
all the picnic trimmings. Then o f course fo r
entertainment we had games and we also saw
an Indian horse race, w ith the Indians themselves
and the horses all decorated up in real
bright colors and feathers. H ow many remember
the terrible train accident in which I.udvig
Onstad lost his leg? Am sending greetings to
him and hope that he is well and enjoyin g life.
A ft e r I had been at the Childrens Home fo r
fou r years. Rev. Homme wrote my dad a special
letter stating that a m inister wished to adopt
me. In the meantime my fath er married again
to Risa Rood from Alpena. H e thought it best
to take me home. I was then a little over eleven
years o f age. One m ight think that 1 would be
glad to leave the Home— but no: I actually cried
to go back. I made the trip to Washburn with
an elderly lady (M rs L o n g) who had come to
visit her grandchildren, Edward and Ingvald
Lee, who were at the Home. Since then I have
made my home in Washburn. In 1899 I received
a special invitation from Rev. Homme to attend
the dedication o f the new Home. A fte r I got
there I was v e ry glad to see them all again. On
N ovem ber 17, 1900, I was married to M artin
Jacobsen. In our home ten children have been
reared. M y fa th er died in 1907.
M y greatest wish had always been to make
another visit to the Orphan's Home. M y husband
and I made this delightful trip last June.
E ven though it rained every day we were there,
w e enjoyed it immensely. W e especially enjoyed
visitin g old acquaintances as the Hagen
fam ily and the Englund fam ily. Then we visited
the tw o homes fo r old folks. Especially
interesting to me was the oldest Homo, as that
was the orphanage when I was a child. A s soon
as w e came to the drivew ay leading to the
Home, I noticed where the well had been, w ith
its old oaken buckets. I ’ll never forget, once
when I was drawing w ater from that very well,
that I lost m y hat in it. N o more hat fo r me fo r
the rest o f that summer. W e also had the
pleasure o f attending services at the church
that Rev. Homme built, the F irst Lutheran
church at W ittenberg. W e viewed his and Mrs.
Homme’s graves, and we know that their good
works and the memory o f them will live in the
hearts o f men forever.
In conclusion I wish to extend greetings to
Carl and W illiam Hom m e; the two Guttenberg
sisters: the tw o Oyhus sisters, and the Englund
and the Hagen fam ilies. A lso special greetings
«or ('tauimrl un Unn
to the workers o f the Childrens Home and the
tw o Homes fo r the A (fed.
Sincerely, Mrs. M artin Jacobsen.

D ear F rien d s:
Recalling the various experiences and events
o f the days spent at the Home during the period
from 1901 to 1914, at which time 1 became o f
age to venture out fo r myself.
A t the age o f five our mother died and dad
was left w ith six boys and one girl, the oldest
being twenty-one and the youngest five, (th at
being m y s e lf). The pastor at Alexandria, Minn.,
Rev. Benson, arranged to have the three youngest,
Robert, Louise, and m yself, sent to the
Homme Orphan Home. W e arrived during the
summer o f 1901. B eing only five years o f age
at the tim e o f entering the Home, I don’t recall
ju st what impression I had o f the change, although
I do remember that Rev. E. J. Homme
gave us a fine welcome and had a lot o f encouragement
fo r us.
A fte r the death o f Rev. Homme in 1903 there
were several o f the children transferred to the
Childrens Home at Beloit. Iowa, and among the
group were my sister Louise and brother Robert
From that tim e on until 1914 the fam ily
was separated and I was left at the Homme
Orphan Home. It is interesting to recall how
some o f the children, that had brothers and sisters,
would go to one o f the older brothers or
sisters w ith th eir troubles, how they would try
and protect them when they got into a fight or
some other trouble; but it was quite a different
experience to some o f us that had to settle our
own disputes. W e couldn’t always go to the
matron or the manager, as we were expected to
take it or we would be subject to fu rth er amusement
from the older boys. Thinking o f this experience
makes me believe that at times it is
necessary fo r children to be able to adjust them selves
to the conditions that surround them
w ithout the aid o f elders, as it gives children
more o f the understanding o f how to control
themselves and also aids them in being able to
cooperate w ith other children.
Rev. Eidahl was the next manager in charge
o f the Home,, and as I recall it the Home was
w ithout bricks, and during the summer o f 1905
the brick was laid for the main building. It was
a lot o f fun fo r us to crawl around on the scaffolds
and watch the men at work. A t times we
w ere allowed to help carry brick and mix the
mortar, and this seemed to be more fun than
work.
Rev. Bjelland succeeded Rev. Eidahl, and remained
w ith us fo r six years, from 1906 to 1912,
and this period seems to be most interesting to
me, as I was at the age o f ten to sixteen under
his management I remember when he patted
me on the head and told me that when I was
fourteen years o f age I was to start w orking in
the print shop, and I felt that was quite an
honor to be chosen to do that work. I did start
to work setting type fo r the “ F or Gammel og
U n g " at the age o f fourteen and managed to
serve tw o years o f my apprenticeship as a printer.
W e ow e Rev. Bjelland a lot o f credit fo r the
many improvements that w ere made during his
six years as manager. I recall how the light
was furnished by the use o f carbide gas, and I
often thought o f the danger o f fire when the
Home was lighted by gas. Am on g the improvements
made during these six years were the
electric lights, a new heating plant, running
w ater and the sewer system. T h e building o f
a large barn and silo, with all the modern conveniences
fo r the care o f the cattle and horses;
also the building that now houses the printing
equipment and laundry.
Miss Agnes Haugen, now Mrs. (lie Stuen,
o f Parkland, Washington, was boys matron
the years from 1906 to 1912, and I have the
highest respect fo r her ability and understanding
o f the problems and care o f the boys. I
know that many o f the boys have had the pleasure
o f visitin g and corresponding with her since
she left the Home.
It was during these years that most o f the
land, that is now used, was broken and that
there was a lot o f hard work d iggin g out stumps
and clearing out the stones that are so numerous
in this part o f the state. Mr. Hans Kirkeb.v,
now residing in the town o f M orris, was in
charge o f the farm work, and he had a mansized
problem and plenty o f hard work im proving
the land for cultivation.
T w o years o f my tim e at the Home were
spent under the management o f Rev. and Mrs.
J. A . Wang. The one thing that I recall o f that
period is how Mrs. W ang planned the outings
fo r the children, picnics, berry picking and fishing
trips. How they used to promise the children
outings if they would be faith fu l in doing
their duties, and you can be sure we did, as we
alw ays looked forw ard to these outings.
During the years I spent at the Home there
were plenty o f small game, such as: Rabbits,
Squirrels, Gophers, Muskrats, Mink and Skunk.
W e were able to earn our spending money by
trapping and hunting these animals. It is interesting
to recall how the trapping grounds
w ere controlled by the older boys. When the
boys became o f age, to leave, they would either
Ivor Warn ind oq I U r
sell or hand down the rights to trap to their
helpers. George Holmes and W illie Skare had
possession o f a large part o f the trapping
grounds and LeonardN ordling and I were chosen
to be their helpers. The duties o f the helpers
w ere such as taking care o f the traps; hunting
new places; setting traps; and skinning the
animals, (including the friendly little animal,
the skunk). These bygone incidents remind
me o f how the “ teachers” objected to the aroma
and how they would chase us out o f school and
compel us to change our clothes before coming
back. W e w'ere given a small part o f the profits
fo r these duties and promised the rights to the
grounds a fte r the older boys had left. Nordling
and m yself inherited the trapping rights
to these grounds and I remember one season
when the trapping was good and we shipped
a large number o f furs to a St. Louis fur company
and received a check fo r the sum o f $54.00.
I left the Home in May 1914 and as I recall
many a tim e I was homesick to be back with the
boys.
O ftim es have I thought o f Ihe days when we
could be down at the old mill pond running logs,
when the old saw mill was in operation, or the
old swim m ing hole, where we could go bathing
during our leisure hours. How we could go fishing
and be able to get a long string o f fine
speckled trout without much effort. In the winter
the skating and sliding on the pond and on
the hills surrounding the Home
I have a large number o f pictures o f the outings
we had, and I hold the memories o f the
tim e spent at the Home very dear.
W hile w orking fo r Mr. J. N . Dahlen at Mt.
Horeb, Wis., in 1915 and 1916, I became acquainted
w ith Rev. Stolen. Rev. Stolen was
manager fo r six years, and it was during his
last year that I accepted the position as Printer-
Kditor fo r the “ For Gammel og U ng.”
I have had the pleasure o f visitin g the Home
many times during the period from 1914 to
1938, and have become acquainted w ith many o f
the children that have left, and I know that the
spiritual and moral training they received at
the Homme Childrens Home has given them the
background and foundation fo r a very successful
future.
There are children from Homme Childrens
Home in almost every state in the union, and
they represent almost every profession and
trade.
N ow that I have a fam ily o f m y own I have
a better understanding o f the problems the
manager and workers have in the teachings and
training o f these children. A ll credit should be
given them fo r the sympathetic understanding
and good judgment shown.
One has to marvel at the courage, vision and
foresight that the founder. R ev. E. J. Homme,
had when he undertook to establish a Home,
when this part o f the state was but a wilderness.
I imagine that if Rev. Homme could be
here to see and hear o f the results o f his undertaking
he would be more than satisfied.
L et us hope and pray that the work o f caring
fo r these children will continue and that it will
be a haven fo r many children that are in need
o f a home and spiritual training.
I am sure I can say fo r the children that
have been at the Home, that they are more than
thankful fo r the care they received, and many
thanks to those who have been so generous in
th eir support o f this Home.
Sincerely yours, O liver Skauby.
Kaukauna, Wisconsin.
M y dear Mr. Lokensgard:
I have had your letter and request o f July
5th on my desk fo r several days now but am at
some loss as to what extent I should go in recalling
events o f m y younger days at the
Orphan’s Home. I feel honored that you should
request this o f me but I realize that to attem pt
any sort o f compliance will necessitate a raml>-
ling letter, attem pting to cover so much and so
interesting a subject in one sitting.
I first got a glimpse o f the Homme Orphan's
Home from the hay under the seats o f a two
seater one-horse open style surrey sleigh, holding
on fo r dear life to said sleigh and crying
aloud in N orw egian : "A n n a (m y m other) has
left me” , “ Anna has left me” . That was about
1908 when I was hardly seven years o f age and
up to that time had not understood a word of
English. In those days we had gas lights, gas
piping all over the place, individual heating
stoves in the rooms— not all the rooms, running
w ater from a wooden tank storage system in
the attic, sheet metal lined bath tubs and outdoor
plumbing throughout. I believe Rev. B jelland
was the manager when I arrived and my
first 5 or 6 y°ars were under his care. I do not
have any particularly happy recollections o f
those first years but they were rela tively crowded.
as a grow in g boys’ days are, and all in all
I’m thankful fo r them During days o f Rev.
Bjelland and early days o f Rev. W ang the whole
scheme o f things was undergoing changes and
the Home did not miss the trend: the carbide
gas lights, gas tanks and equipment had to go,
in favor o f electricity; the water tank and
g ra v ity feed system was abandoned w ith the
installation o f tw o large steel storage (pressure
524 J5#r Wammfl og Unn
system ) tanks in the basement o f chapel w in g
o f building, a large soft w ater storage tank was
constructed in excavation in “ g irl’s side” o f the
building; indoor plumbing facilities w ere installed;
the kitchen was re-equipped w ith
modern facilities; the old side entrances to the
dining room w ere closed up and th eir use discontinued;
all heating stoves w ere rem oved
from various rooms, in fa v o r o f a central heating
plant w ith pressure heat to radiators, etc.,
throughout the building. These changes took a
period o f years, o f course, but they w ere realities
and even in m y young days th ey w ere so
profound as to never let me fo rg e t th e change
o f things fo r the better. The good people who
supported the Hom e in those days and those
w ho controlled the policies at the tim e should
have been commended highly fo r so keeping
abreast o f the times.
One can imagine the difficult conditions,
say w ith an outbreak o f diphtheria, scarlet
fever, etc., amongst so many children under the
old inconveniences and facilities fo r sanitation.
Likew ise improvements w ere also made on the
farm , in the print shop and in the laundry.
W ith the building o f a new barn, installation o f
steel stanchions, w ater cups, ven tilatin g fa cilities,
tw o new silos, a large root collar, (under
the annex building) things were made considerably
easier and much more liveable. W e boys
had to help work on lots o f these im provements
so, o f course, they are more or less fresh in m y
memory. One man that had a lot to do w ith revam
ping our old Homestead and did most o f the
carpenter w ork fo r such was Mr. E ric Hanson,
o f W ittenberg. I remember one tim e when I
talked back to him while shingling the roof o f
the present printshop and he took a fte r me so
fa st that I believe I went down the long ladder
from the roof to the ground without touching
more than three rungs. On another occasion,
our farm boss took a fte r me with a stick w rapper
from a shingle bundle fo r over-sleeping, I
always was good at over-sleeping, and I had
welts all over me— but they didn't hurt near as
much as the fact that he broke a fountain pen I
had in the side pocket o f m y jumpers. A catastrophe
at the time but a good jok e years later.
W h ile telling tales I recall this one: George
Sargis and I had been busy in the forbidden
patch o f luscious green peas back o f the park
and had all our pockets nicely filled when Rev.
Bjelland called to us from behind some trees;
as we slowly walked toward him we w ere busily
rem oving the peas from pockets and dumping
them down our pants legs (our only summer
clothes being the usual blue shirt and de*nim
overalls) leaving a tell-tale trail o f green peas
in the pathway from the pea field. W hen we
got to Rev. Bjelland we showed him only empty
pockets and attem pted to convince him that we
w ere ju st average good little boys. In his methodical
manner he proceeded to help us rem emb
er: down w e w ent on our hands and knees,
craw ling along and picking up every last pea as
Rev. B jelland walked along behind w ith a
switch seeing to the thoroughness o f our task.
A ft e r retrievin g all o f the peas we had to place
them in his black derby hat— at which he said
“ T h a t’s fine, now g e t” and, needless to say, “ we
g o t” . Such incidents are recalled with pleasure
now and I do not ever rem ember carrying a prolonged
grudge against any o f our superiors who
seemed to be a little harsh w ith us at times.
Th e Orphan’s Home is the only home I remember
and, o f course, such boyhood events
from home are all forgiven . A s I grew up w ith out
ever knowing or experiencing a m other’s
love, the only such feelin g I had was shared in
my mind principally w ith a few o f the women
folks at the Home, m ainly a M iss Agnes Hougen
and Mrs. R ev. J. A . W ang. Such parental affection
was o f necessity stifled and discouraged
and as a consequence I have to this day to try
hard to g et excited about things o f vital im portance
to m y brothers and sisters. W e kids had
to do our share o f farm work, help with the
chores' before and a fte r school, had to go to
school as fa r as through the eighth grade: we
used to all load into the big side seater wagons
and d rive to church in the V illa g e on Sundays;
we w ere not allowed to go the V illage except on
a w ritten pass, the constable being in cooperation
w ith the Home's manager. W e went barefoo
t every summer— necessitating a new pair o f
shoes each autumn as our feet “ would grow so” ;
w e had our hair clipped short every spring-, or,
more often if the lice were particularly th rivin g
amongst the children, w eekly doses o f kerosene
being our cure-all; we had our own board shanties
in the woods, across the pond, at which w e
I would gorge on baked potatoes, fried wild rab-
1 bit and chocolate fudge, the sugar, etc., fo r the
latter being usually pilfered from the kitchen
or storeroom. W e boys had “ our girls” as boys
the world over do, at least think they do, and it
was a problem to keep another better looking
boy from g ettin g our g irl fo r the Grand March
at our m onthly games night in the g ir l’s play
room. O f course we w ere not allowed to have
dates w ith the girls, could not go to shows
(m o v ie s), and w ere not allowed to dance. M y
first try at dancing was when I was a senior at
H igh School and I had to do that on the sly.
During my time, attendance at the W itten b erg
' H igh School was optional fo r the Home boys,
^ot Wummtl og Ung
we having to do our share o f chores before and
a fte r school and take our regular turn o f the
summer w ork during school vacations. W e
walked to school, carried our own lunches, and
on the whole kept ourselves abreast o f the other
boys and g irls in the high school. Our clothes
w ere not alw ays the best, often fit poorly, stockings
needed darning, but when occasion demanded,
Mrs. W an g would from somewhere,
somehow, fit us out w ith clothes that looked as
good as those worn by any private youngster in
the H igh School. A ll in all the town students
w ere very democratic and frien dly to us, let us
in w ith them and made us feel that we w ere
somebody. The biggest thing that an orphan
boy or g irl has to overcome is the in ferio rity
complex that somehow or other is a part o f
every orphaned youngster when he ventures out
o f his immediate surroundings. I believe the
attendance o f each boy and g irl at H igh School
would have a lot to do in dispelling that fault
w h ile y et in its form a tive stages.
W e seldom received money as boys at the
Home, w ith the exception o f a dime or tw o fo r
the Fourth o f July and later years at the Fest.
Our Christmas jo y s consisted o f a popcorn ball,
an orange, some apples and a sack o f mixed
nuts and hard candy. Those o f us who received
nothing from our parents would g et a dull bladed
jack knife, a top or the like. W e all took a
lusty part in the program s as it got us out into
the Village, fo r programs and more candy at the
Old People’s Home and at the N orw egian
Church. I ’ ll never fo rg e t when the ushers started
passing me by w ith th eir oranges and pop
corn as I was too tall, too old, “ these are ju st
fo r the children.” On those occasions I wanted
to be a bit younger again. W e used to w ork fo r
pin money “ a fte r hours” on our own tim e; pickin
g berries, trapping woodchucks (10 cents a
ta il), gophers (10c a head) and crows (25c a
h e a d ); even sold fish at times, and in those days
w e used to get m igh ty pretty specimens o f rainbow
trout in the Embarrass branch running
through the Home property. G ettin g back to
the gopher heads: one summer we cleaned up all
the chipmunks fo r m iles around as a chipmunk
head looks like a gopher head when kept in salt
fo r a day or two. T h is netted us quite a number
o f dimes until the town chairman got wise
to us. Just a “ close business deal” as they would
call it today. W e also made pin money from
raising chicks, pink-eyed rabbits, and pigeons.
Leave it to a bunch o f healthy youngsters to
think o f some method o f making money.
I finished H igh School in 1919 (w as class
poet, in which I predicted m yself as being a
poultry rancher 10 years hence, a m igh ty poor
guess) and le ft the Orphan’ s Home a month
later to take a job as a farm hand at Iola, Wis.
A ft e r a few. months o f not earning m y wages
and almost losing my le ft hand in a mechanical
hay fork accident, I obliged my boss by quitting;
he didn’ t have the heart to discharge me. I then
got a job teaching school, taught 26 Polish
children in a grade school near Stevens Point,
and was even asked by the school board to come
back the next year. I refused the offer and attended
Stevens Poin t N orm al school, the summer
session o f 1920 and regular term o f 1920-
’21, w ith the idea o f becoming a High School
teacher. In the meantime I had located my relatives
(2 brothers and 3 sisters) and in the
summer o f 1922 went to C alifornia to live with
them and g ive up my school studies at Stevens
Poin t fo r the tim e being. It m ight be noted
here that during my stay at the Orphan’s Home
I had been led to believe that I was an only child,
so o f course the accidental discovery o f other
relatives was a surprise. A remark made innocently
by one o f the managers while I was
being reprimanded fo r some misdemeanor in his
office stuck in m y mind and at the first opportunity
a fte r leaving the Hom e I went to a town
in southern Minnesota to look up my birth record
and learn o f the other members o f our fam ily.
I stayed w ith the fa m ily in Sacramento,
California, fo r 3 years; during which I worked
as a clerk fo r one year in the main postoffice;
spent 6 months learning the machinist's trade
in Southern Pacific R. R. shops; one year with
survey parties in the Sierra Nevada mountains
w ith the C alifornia H igh w ay Commission and
six months on various construction jobs, m ostlv
as a hod ca rrier; all o f which convinced me o f
m y g ettin g nowhere in particular and that I
really wanted to make the building construction
gam e m y life ’s work. Tim es w ere better then
and jobs were not so scarce as they are today.
In early July o f 1924 I bid good bye to the
folks and headed back east, in easy stages, via
Oregon, Washington. Idaho, Montana, and Tw in
Cities, and m et Mr. Sam Sargis at the Annual
F est at W itten b erg in the fall o f 1924, who
offered to g et me acquainted and started at
school at Madison that fall. I only had $75 to
m y name but through splendid advice and moral
support from Mr. Sargis I was able to finish my
fo u r years work at the State U n iversity in regular
tim e; w aitin g tables in sororities, tending
furnaces and doing dra ftin g work, fo r board and
room and pin money, and w orking on survey
parties w ith Anaconda Copper Co. (in Ontario,
Canada) and Wisconsin H ighw ay Commission
during summer vacations. I g o t m y degree in
C ivil E ngineering from Wisconsin in the spring
r ta r f t a m m r l or ltn q
o f 1928 and left fo r northern Michigan the day
a fte r graduation to do survey work w ith the
United States E ngineerin g Dept., W ar Department.
I was on that work fo r 2 ' ■> years and in
the late summer o f 1930 was transferred to the
Fox R iver V alley to do field work and reconstruction
o f locks and dams on said Fox River,
from Green Bay to Neenah-Menasha and from
Oshkosh up to Portage, where a two mile canal
joins the Fox and Wisconsin rivers. M y work
w ith the W ar Dept, has been varied, interesting
and on the whole very satisfactory.
I was married in A p ril 1931 to Miss Elsie
Bronstad o f Minneapolis. Minn., fo r a short time
one o f the girls at the Home at W ittenberg. W e
went into housekeeping here in Kaukauna and
were nicely settled when the baby came, born
on March 19,1932. Dear Elsie passed into eternity
the follow ing day, paying the supreme
price in g ivin g birth to our daughter Elsie Joan.
The why and w h erefore o f some events in life
are m ystifyin g, to say the least, and perhaps it
is not fo r us to ask questions in the face o f such
things. The blow is staggerin g enough no matter
when or how it comes, and I ’m convinced
that all one can do is to carry on, fo r the young
one that is ours to keep and guide through a
bewildering life span and fo r the cherished
memory o f a loved one who was taken away
when so happy and apparently on the brink o f
a full and fru itfu l life.
Elsie Joan Bambery is now 7 years and 4
months, is doing nicely and has finished her
second year o f schooling. I broke up housekeeping
in March 1932 and since then have been
livin g at hotels in Green Bay, De Pere and Kaukauna,
as m ight be nearest the construction
operations at the particular time. I have spent
most o f the last fou r years at De Pere, Wis.
On occasions in the past I have taken vacation
trips to visit the folks in California, which
I enjoy immensely, but this spring I had 7
weeks accrued leave o f absence (w ith p a y ) to
take before the end o f the fiscal year. I traveled
(b y train ) to Chicago, Pittsburgh, Washington,
D. C., Philadelphia and N ew Y ork. Spent eigh t
days in N ew Y ork to see the city and the
W orld’s Fair. I stayed three days with Mr. and
Mrs. George E. Sargis (fo rm e r Orphan Home
boy) while th ere; they have a nice home out at
Merrick, Long Island, 30 miles out o f down town
N ew York. He is now w orking fo r the Consolidated
Edison Co. o f N ew Y ork. On May 19th I
boarded a Dollar L in er (S. S. President Garfield)
at N ew York, bound fo r down along the
Atlantic Coast, stopped at Havana, Cuba, then
on through the Caribbean sea fo r Panama Canal
— crossed through this canal on May 27, then up
along the Pacific Coast from Balboa to Los
Angeles, 9 days at sea, stopped tw o days at Los
Angeles and then finished our boat trip up the
C alifornia Coast into San Francisco, coming in
under the new Golden Gate bridge in early morning
o f June 8th. I was up at 4:00 A . M. that
day, fo r I wouldn’ t want to miss such a sight
and on such a beautiful day. I w ent through
the usual U. S. Customs and quarantine and said
good bye to the boat and many casual friends I
had met on our 18 day cru ise: spent 3 days taking
in the Golden Gate Exposition and then two
weeks w ith my relatives in C alifornia again. On
my w ay back home I took the Southern Pacific
from San Francisco to Ogden, stopped a day at
Salt Lake, fo r tours o f the famous Mormon C ity,
Tabernacle, etc., and even swam in the 27'-"
salty waters o f Great Salt L a k e; talked to Samson
Sargis via phone w hile at Salt Lake C ity :
he lives at Provo, Utah, but my tim e did not
permit a personal visit. I took the Union Pacific
from Salt Lake C ity to Omaha,, via Laram ie
and Cheyenne; and the Chicago and N orthw estern
from Omaha to Chicago, to change trains
fo r north to Wisconsin and was back on the job
at Appleton on the m orning o f June 26. 1939,
a fte r about the most enjoyable and extensive
vacation trip I ’ve ever had— travellin g 3500
miles by rail and 6000 miles by boat, a total o f
9500 miles.
On this trip I had the opportunity to see
w ith m y own eyes such sights as N ew Y ork
City, w ith its sky line, skysrapers, traffic problems,
subways, suspension bridges, its five large
boroughs, its Harlem, Tim es Square, Greenwich
V illage, Central P a rk ; the Atlantic Fleet's figh ting
ships at anchor in the Hudson: such ships
as Queen M ary and Normandie at th eir 48th St.
berths; a trip up the Hudson to W est Point, to
see our fu tu re A rm y Officers perform their
commencement exercises drill formations, then
down along the Jersey Palisades; and then take
a voyage on a modern round-the-world “ Passeng
er-freig h ter” boat, fo r short stops at Havana,
Cuba and Panama Canal Zone; to pass through

A ll this one has to be thankful for, thankful
that we are citizens o f such a great nation,
thankful that w'e’re livin g in an age w here such
progress is being made and thankful that we
are livin g in a country that is so tolerant in
m any ways and as yet is holding its head high
enough to be an inspiration to the younger and
gro w in g generation o f this nation and o f foreign
countries.
And so to bring this rambling discourse to
the point I want to m ake: I have already fe lt on
numerous occasions and always w ill feel, as long
as I live, a deep and sincere gratefulness to the
Homm e Orphans Home and to the managers,
advisers and supporters who in some measure
help to make it what it is and what it stands for.
Since a youngster I have alw ays had a desire to
see "w h at's over the hill” and to learn “ how the
other half lives” . I m ight have been born w ith
such notions or I m ight have picked them up at
the Home |but w herever th ey came from I feel
gratefu l to the Home in startin g us out in
school, refusing to coddle us and literally kicking
us out and making us stand on our own feet.
W e were started out w ith the one idea o f making
the best o f what we have. W e have learned
to appreciate life, and all that goes w ith it,
w hether it be simple or complex and if one is
taught to get some wholesomeness out o f an
otherw ise drab existence. I venture to say that
the start in our early days was the correct one.
I feel thankful to the Home and the N orw egian
Lutheran Church fo r caring fo r me as a youngster
and fo r bringing me on up to face a life so
complex, yet in terestin g; fo r teaching me to believe
in a supreme b e in g : fo r helping prepare
one to try to be a good citizen, to appreciate our
freedom and to have only respect fo r our G overnment
o f these United States o f Am erica.
Sincerely yours, James E. Bambery.

Dear Mr. Lokensgard:
Y ou r letter o f July 5th is acknowledged. A s
it reached me during m y busiest period o f the
year, inventory time, I w ill have to be excused
f o r a more prompt reply.
I feel sligh tly honored by being one o f the
select few to ofTer you what I have gained while
being one o f the boys at the Homme Childrens
Home. I hope that what I am about to w rite
will be o f interest to your readers o f your weekly
publication.
The necessity o f my being placed in this Institution,
came about at the age o f eight, a fter
losing both parents. Many homes were suggested
to our guardian, but being well advised by
our minister, w e w ere placed under the splendid
care o f R ev. and Mrs. J. A . W ang. M y younger
sister and I came to W itten b erg in the evening
o f March 11, 1920. A ft e r being pushed around
the relation fo r tw o years which passed since
the death o f my mother in 1918, we seemed to
think a new world was opening before us. I can
well remember the events as they occurred. It
was not difficult to acquaint m yself with all the
children, and before long I was taken as one of
them. M y place was assigned to me both at the
dining room and sleeping room by our kindly
matron, who seemed to take special interest in
doing some little th ing to please children. Since
I always liked animals, the large barns and
buildings attracted m y eyes long before more
important landmarks appeared. The woods, the
old swim m ing hole, and many other places, even
now appear to my mind as a realistic picture.
The children were all known by their nickname,
a few o f the common ones being: Trola,
Pants, Skinner, Frenchy, Sheenie, and Quail.
These names came about by some peculiarity
o f the individual’s name or habit, and it stayed
w ith him until his leaving upon the age o f 18
years. A t that time, a party was given in his
honor in the g irls’ playroom. Games such as
Farm er-in-the-Dell and Drop the Handkerchief
w ere most popular, and everyone longed fo r this
occasion because o f the m ingling o f both girls
and boys w ith each other.
D uring m y five years at the Childrens Home,
my grade school education was completed and I
was privileged to attend the H igh School fo r my
freshman year. I was chosen fo r the valedictorian
at our graduation, and fe lt very proud to
have earned such honor. M y confirmation also
lent jo y to me in this same year.
M y health remained good except fo r an
attack o f pneumonia, at which time Dr. Thompson
and old fath erly Dr. Rothman, nursed me
through those dangerous hours.
A few o f my classmates’ whereabouts are
still known to me even though we have drifted
some miles apart. Lena Smestad is now employed
at the Madison General Hospital as a
Dietition. George Sindberg is teaching Physical
Education and coaching at a high school in
South Dakota. Parence Christianson is livin g
in Muskegon Heights, Michigan, and I am still a
bachelor here in Beloit. I am employed in the
Cost department o f a m anufacturing enterprise.
M y work consists o f accumulating data fo r the
benefit o f figuring the cost o f sales by controling
the labor distribution and the raw material
requisitions. Since leaving W itten b erg H igh
School and the Homme Childrens Home I have
continued m y studies here in Beloit and through
Correspondence School where I am studying
Certified Public Accounting and Business A d ministration.
A number o f the children and th eir fam ilies
are also livin g in Beloit and surrounding cities.
The Ellingson fam ily, who spent much o f their
childhood years in W ittenberg, are liv in g here
in Beloit, engaged in various business enterprises.
and we continue to visit w ith each other
at every opportunity, talking over pranks and
deviltries, that all children, both boys and girls,
would be finding themselves faced with. Bernard
Thorson, Isabelle Isherwood, the Stenson
sisters, Inez and Lillian, are livin g in Milwaukee.
Gladys Stensrud and Emma K love are in Madison
and Anna Klovdahl is making a beautiful
w ife and home to a gentleman in Wisconsin
Rapids.
In closing I want to wish you much success
w ith your new career as manager o f the Childrens
Home. I shall look forw ard to our meeting
on August 13th, at which tim e I will attend the
Fall F estival there in W ittenberg.
Yours very truly, W illiam G. Duenow.

D ear F rien d s:
When this season o f the year rolls around,
it brings back many memories o f the fou r and
one half years which I spent at the Home.
Probably you all know that there are some unpleasant
memories, but they are always outnumbered
by the pleasant ones.
W h ile I was at the Home I learned a great
many things and also developed many ideas and
ideals which have helped me a great deal since
I left. One o f the most enjoyable memories o f
the Home is the river. It was there that I
learned to swim and also to skate. It is one
th in g I miss very much. Christmas is another
enjoyable memory. The Christmas season, at
th e Home, really lasts about tw o weeks. Its
very beginning is the arrival o f Christmas gifts.
The Christmas program coming about the
middle o f the week eases the tension somewhat.
Rut o f course Christmas E ve is the most exciting
tim e o f all. In the last fe w years the g ifts
have been given out when just the children were
present. I think this is a much better method.
It made me feel that I was one o f a large fam ily.
Christmas wasn’t the only holiday which was
filled w ith pleasure. W e all looked forw ard to
the Fourth o f July. In the morning nearly
everyone went swim ming. In the afternoon we
played games and went swimming, and in the
evening w e had fireworks. The last Fourth
which I spent at the Home the workers challenged
the big girls and b ig boys to a baseball
game. Vou can guess who won— we did o f
course. Th an ksgiving D ay was truly a day o f
th anksgiving fo r us, fo r it meant chicken, fru it
salad, and the many other things which children
love. It also was the opening day o f skating
season.
O f course my fou r years at the Home were
not spent in holidays only. W e all had our certain
duties, fo r which I am thankful. One o f
the duties o f everyone but the smallest, was to
make our beds as soon as we got up in the morning.
This is a habit o f mine now and I am
thankful that it is.
The fall festival brings back many memories.
First the tim e spent in cleaning and g ettin g
ready, then the arrival o f Fest day. The older
girls usually had to set tables and make sandwiches,
but were fre e a great part o f the day to
visit w ith friends. The festival lasted tw o
days fo r us. W e usually had the picnic on Monday
at M ayflow er lake, but in the few years we
had it on the Home lawn.
This letter wouldn’ t be complete i f I didn’t
mention the religious trainin g which I received
at the Home. I was confirmed in a class o f
about tw elve, including my brother. I also took
music lessons, and th erefore played fo r church
fo r about a yea r and a half. Although I am no
N orwegian. I belong to the N orw egian Lutheran
church and am secretary o f our Luth er League.
I know I can truthfu lly say that m y religious
training at the Home has enabled me to become
a member o f the Plym outh Church.
I made many frien ds while I was at the Home,
but o f course it is impossible to know where
they all are now. Some o f them w ith whom I'v e
kept in touch are Pearl Peterson, o f Madison,
South Dakota. Edna Drew, o f St. Paul, Minn.,
Isabelle Isherwood. o f W est Allis. Wise., Bert
and Earl Nutter, o f Wausau, Wise., and Ruby
Hess, o f Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
I am gratefu l to the Christian church that it
has done its duty in m aintaining these Homes
fo r unfortunate children. I am also grateful
fo r everythin g which has been done fo r me at
the Home.
Sincerely, Esther Moberg.
