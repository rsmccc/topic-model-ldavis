   <p>Married Teachers Keep Jobs Marriage is not sufficient cause for the
    discharge of school teachers tenure law passed by the 1937 legislature says
    the state suprem e court In test cases brought to the sta tes highest court
    by disputes over dism issals of teachers for m arriage in Racine and
    Milwaukee counties the court ruled th a t the law allowed school boards to
    discharge teachers who have served a fiveyear probationary period only for
    inefficiency or misbehavior The court added th a t if the legislature in its
    wisdom desires to authorize school boards to determine whether the best
    interests of the schools committed to their adm inistration require the
    adoption of a policy against reemploying teachers who have m arried it can
    so declare by appropriately amending the present law The 1939 legislature
    now has a bill before it introduced by Assemblyman Glenn H Jam es Republican
    which would repeal the teachers tenure law Decreased Freight Rates The
    Wisconsin public service commissions Five year effort to get lower freight
    rates for sta te farmers and manufacturers on shipments to and from
    southeastern states moved a step closer to complete success with the
    announcement of a reduction in class freig h t rates ordered by the
    interstate commerce commission The reduction said the commission will elim
    inate advantages held by other states over Wisconsin The new rates which
    become effective as soon as they are published will lower rates 7 cents per
    100 pounds on first class freight from central Wisconsin to New Orleans 5
    cents to Jacksonville Florida and 5 cents to A tlanta Now pending before the
    interstate commerce commission is a petition from the railroads to establish
    special rates on fresh and green fruits vegetables and melons The sta te
    public service commission has objected to the petition pointing out the
    unreasonableness of present rates and the existence of lower rates from te
    rritories competing with Wisconsin producers Determined Legislature
    Wisconsins 1939 RepublicanDemocratic controlled legislature appears
    determined not to allow any of the special legislation passed by the 1937 La
    Follette adm inistration to remain in the sta tu te books All of the
    executive order governmental reorganization tran sfers as made by ExGovernor
    La Follette have been removed The Wisconsin Development A uthority which su
    rvived only after a second supreme court decision appeared headed for doom
    as the assembly last week by a vote of 58 to 38 prepared a WDA repeal bill
    for final passage The clear m ajority vote leaves no doubt that the assembly
    will repeat its repeal action this week and send the bill over to the senate
    The senate is expected to accord it similar treatm ent The senate has
    already sent over to the assembly for concurrence bills which will wipe out
    the departm ent of commerce and abolish all other reorganization m easures
    not included in the executive orders There is little doubt but th a t the
    assembly will concur with the senate in both senate repeal bills That much
    mooted Wisconsin 1937 labor act is also slated for drastic revision by a
    bill introduced at the request of the Wisconsin Council of Agriculture
    Abolishment of the Wisconsin A gricultural Authority a nonprofit private
    corporation which was to receive $100000 a year to advertise and m arket
    Wisconsin products is asked in a bill introduced by Senator Brown Oshkosh
    Republican Industry and Taxes Prime purpose of the commerce departm ent set
    up by the Progressives and now about to be withdrawn by the 1939 legislature
    was to gather facts concerning industry leaving the state because of
    excessive taxes Although its repeal is almost cer tain the senate already
    having ap proved such a measure bills fostered by Republicans indicate th a
    t the work of obtaining that information will be carried on A bill in the
    assembly would set up a factfinding legislative interim committee composed
    of three assemblymen and two senators to carry on that work Another bill
    originating in the senate would appropriate sufficient funds to the tax
    commission to complete the taxindustry survey now being carried on by the
    commerce departm ent However Senator George Hampel Milwaukee Socialist
    thinks he has a better idea In a bill which he proposed to the senate this
    week he would prevent industries from moving out of the state or from
    changing their location within the state unless approved by the industrial
    commission He would have the person firm partnership or corporation desiring
    the change in location show in applying for the certificate th a t (1) the
    removal is necessary for the continued success of the business; (2) all
    employees have been offered work at the new location at the same wage and
    hour scale; (3) the removal will not cause an increase in relief loads; (4)
    the removal is not being made to avoid labor standards; (5) the m anagem ent
    a t the new location will not hinder the tran sfer of employees The bill
    also entitles the state or a municipality to injunctive relief against the
    removal of the plant and provides th at the injunction may require the
    return of the plant to its previous location Another provision prevents
    discrimination against resi Church of the Holy Family No mass on Sunday

    arriage is not sufficient cause for the discharge of school teachers tenure
    law passed by the 1937 legislature says the sta te supreme court In test
    cases brought to the sta te s highest court by disputes over dism issals of
    teachers for m arriage in R acine and Milwaukee counties the court ruled th
    a t the law allowed school boards to discharge teachers who have served a
    fiveyear probationary period only for inefficiency or misbehavior The court
    added th at if the legislature in its wisdom desires to authorize school
    boards to determine whether the best interests of the schools committed to
    their adm inistration require the adoption of a policy against reemploying
    teachers who have m arried it can so declare by appropriately amending the
    present law The 1939 legislature now has a bill before it introduced by
    Assemblyman Glenn H Jam es Republican which would repeal ^he teachers tenure
    law Decreased Freight Kates The Wisconsin public service commissions
    fiveyear effort to get lower freight rates for state farm ers and m
    anufacturers on shipm ents to and from southeastern states moved a step
    closer to complete success with the announcement of a reduction in class
    freight rates ordered by the interstate commerce commission The reduction
    said the commission will elim inate advantages held by other states over
    Wisconsin The new rates which become effective as soon as they are published
    will lower rates 7 cents per 100 pounds on first class freight from central
    Wisconsin to New Orleans 5 cents to Jacksonville Florida and 5 cents to A
    tlanta Now pending before the interstate commerce commission is a petition
    from the railroads to establish special rates on fresh and green fruits
    vegetables and melons The sta te public service commission has objected to
    the petition pointing out the unreasonableness of present rates and the
    existence of lower rates from te rritories competing with Wisconsin
    producers Determined Legislature Wisconsins 1939 RepublicanDemocratic
    controlled legislature appears determined not to allow any of the special
    legislation passed by the 1937 La Follette adm inistration to remain in the
    sta tu te books All of the executive order governm ental reorganization tran
    sfers as made by ExGovernor La Follette have been removed The Wisconsin
    Development A uthority which survived only after a second supreme court
    decision appeared headed for doom as the assembly last week by a vote of 58
    to 38 prepared a WDA repeal bill fo r final passage The clear m ajority vote
    leaves no doubt that the assembly will repeat its repeal action this week
    and send the bill over to the senate The senate is expected to accord it sim
    ilar treatm ent The senate has already sent over to the assembly for
    concurrence bills which will wipe out the departm ent of commerce and
    abolish all other reorganization m easures not included in the executive
    orders There is little doubt but th a t the assembly will concur with the
    senate in both senate repeal bills T hat much mooted Wisconsin 1937 labor
    act is also slated for drastic revision by a bill introduced at the request
    of the Wisconsin Council of Agriculture Abolishment of the Wisconsin A
    gricultural A uthority a nonprofit private corporation which was to receive
    $100000 a year to advertise and m arket Wisconsin products is asked in a
    bill introduced by Senator Brown Oshkosh Republican Industry and Taxes Prime
    purpose of the commerce departm ent set up by the Progressives and now about
    to be withdrawn by the 1939 legislature was to gather facts concerning
    industry leaving the state because of excessive taxes Although its repeal is
    almost certain the senate already having approved such a measure bills
    fostered by Republicans indicate th a t the work of obtaining that
    information will be carried on A bill in the assembly would set up a
    factfinding legislative interim committee composed of three assemblymen and
    two senators to carry on th a t work Another bill originating in the senate
    would appropriate sufficient funds to the tax commission to complete the
    taxindustry survey now being carried on by the commerce departm ent better
    idea In a bill which he proposed to the senate this week he would prevent
    industries from moving out of the sta te or from changing their location
    within the sta te unless approved by the industrial commission He would have
    the person firm partnership or corporation desiring the change in location
    show in applying for the certificate th a t (1) the removal is necessary for
    the continued success of the business; (2) all employees have been offered
    work at the new location at the same wage and hour scale; (3) the removal
    will not cause an increase in relief loads; (4) the removal is not being
    made to avoid labor standards; (5) the m anagem ent a t the new location
    will not binder the tra n sfe r of employees The bill also entitles the
    state or a municipality to injunctive relief against the removal of the
    plant and provides th at the injunction may require the return of the plant
    to its previous location Another provision prevents discrim ination against

    agricultural conservation committeemeen have started to make farm visits to
    explain the 1939 farm program and assist each farm er to so plan his 1939
    crop rotation so th at he may comply fully with his allotment and do his
    part in carrying out the purposes of the agricultural conservation program
    Each committeeman will carry with him the farm map of the farm ers he is to
    visit with the fields and their acreages listed thereon He will also have a
    computation sheet showing the maximum payment which can be earned on the
    farm Crops contemplated for 1939 will be entered on the map and the farm er
    will then know how he lines up If necessary to make changes he will have
    ample time to do so if he so desires However the program is voluntary and
    the farm er can do absolutely as he wishes The county committee urges that
    every farm er cooperate to the fullest extent with the committeeman when H

    the Associated P re ss could I not let th at speech pass without including
    in the account of it the fact th at the day before when Sen Alva B A dam s
    of Colorado had been asked if he appreciated the help | G arn er had given
    his side he had said Yes I do As a m a tte r of fact everybody interested
    knew th at tne White House m ade a terrific flght to win th at roll call and

    e" w as ; not relief at all Most of the senai tors who had lined up against
    the P resid ent will be perfectly willing and said so to vote m ore m oney
    la te r if the P resident will declare an em ergency exists The issue w as
    clearly to trim a little of the P resid en ts powers It w as not clearcut
    Many senators w ere frightened into line by the cold w ave which accom
    panied the fight They w ere afraid their constitu en ts m ight figure they w
    ere j willing to let m en and women freeze | and starv e The w eather w as

    again with a declaration of em er | gency if he w ants any m orere I stric
    ts by a good deal the blanket power he has exercised over relief spending
    and by the sam e token tends to trim his policital power to ju st th a t
    extent Make no m istake about it that fight was the opening wedge of the
    battle which is really aim ed a t preventing a Roosevelt third term and 1
    preventing the choice of any outand out New Dealer as Roosevelts successor
    in the 1940 convention Specifically it was aim ed at the spenders in the New
    Deal It dem onstrated a lack of sym pathy for m any of the Roosevelt
    lieutenants including m ost spectacularly M arriner S Eccles head of the
    fede ral reserve board Mr E ccles is not worried about the deficits or the m
    ounting national debt Congress by th at vote on relief first in the house
    and second in the senate showed that it is But som e of the Southern
    senators and other leaders a re not willing yet to adm it th at they a re
    really fighting continued Roosevelt m astery They w ant to w atch a few
    developm ents first to determ ine ju st how safe it is to be against him
    They w ant to leave a few bridges unburned so they can rejoin him if he
    should prove unbeatable Down underneath m ost of them hope he will be
    succeeded by som eone with economic views m uch furth er to the right It
    will be noticed in Senator Bankheads very cagey rem ark s that he left open
    doors leading in every direction The 1 speech fooled no one in the White |
    House crowd But it pleased them : just the sam e It tended to soften i the
    blow Congress Is S e t Against C iting Sew Deal Free Hand It th at
    suggestion about setting up another TVA in southern Illinois which would
    generate power from the coal deposits there instead of from w ater power had
    been m ade four y ears ago or even last y ear it would have frightened the
    utilities to death Now they are hoping that nothing will happen because
    congress is set against giving the New Deal a free hand on spending is
    willing to be liberal when it com es to danger of people starving or
    freezing but is inclined to be a tightw ad when it com es to new public
    works As for exam ple P assam aquoddy and the F lorida canal both of which
    seem doomed to rem ain sidetracked Besides and this is really the funny p
    art of the situation there is not the popular appeal in developing
    electricity from coal that there is from w ater power Down underneath the
    New Deal is all for it P resident Roosevelt is just as unfriendly to thc p m
    a te ly owned utilities as ever But this is no tim e to be agitating this p
    articu lar point certainly until the S u p rem t court nas clarified it in
    thc TVA case I Best opinion here as to thc fu tu u of public ow nership of
    big power de velopm ents is th a t hey will be confined for a tim e a t
    least to w ater power The answ er is sim ple In the first place th ere is
    the popular notion th at pow er produced from w ater pow er is the cheapest
    power in the w orldalm ost free Second th ere is the popular idea th at wate
    r pow er is one of our g re a t n a tional resources belonging not to the
    few people who happen to own the land adjacen t to the m ost favorable spot
    for developing it but to all the people Cost of Producing Electric Current
    It Very Small A ctually of course the cost of producing electric cu rre n t
    is so sm all th a t it does not m ake m uch difference which m ethod is used
    But if you insist on going into decim als coal is ch eaper th an w ater
    power The city of W ashington offers an excellent illustration Sen George W
    N orris has long advocated the developm ent of w a te r pow er a t G reat F
    alls on the P otom ac a few m iles above W ashington As an engineering
    proposition it is perfectly sound It is now being pressed in the house by
    Rep Jo h n E R ankin of M ississippi N em esis of the private utilities and
    lead er of the public power bloc R ankin would set up a "P o to m ac Valley
    au th o rity modeled afte r his beloved TVA B ut engineers a re agreed th at
    such a developm ent would not produce cu rre n t any m ore cheaply than the
    private com pany does now And the com pany uses a cheap grade of anthracite
    which h as to be hauled down from n ortheastern P ennsylvania A ctually pow
    er is produced from this coal a t a cost of only th ree m ills per kilow att
    a t the sw itchboard Of course the governm ent could tak e th at sam e ste
    am plant and produce electricity at som ething less than the th ree m ills
    it costs the com pany assum ing th at it operated as efficiently as the com
    pany does now T here is an item of taxes which includes local property
    assessm ents and federal incom e taxes in th at th ree mills But obviously
    no econom y could be affected so far as the production of electricity is
    concerned which would be very im portant to the consum ers Yet it would be
    so rt of tough on the coal m iners in P ennsylvania to try to effect this
    econom y 1 Expect N o Speed From This Session of Congress T here is no use

    the obvious groping for the m ost expedient thing politicallyso patent that

    generally freshening up before luncheon It w as on the short ja u n t acro

    eaving around his legs and purring up a t him in friendship Daisy would

    it at last He sa t on the other m a n s body gasping for breath Sim
    ultaneously he released his grip of C raig s throat T hat w as a dam ned
    silly p erform ance he gasped out when he could speak He had expected
    another outburst possibly another struggle But C raig lay still to an accom

    took pity on him and said no m ore He also m oved from his victim s stom ach

    spoilage facto r Mr K rueger says Slightly etched o r roughened surfaces can
    be sm oothed satisfactorily by using a cem ent w ash or other
    penetrationtype protective Where the surface has been deeply etched it will
    be best to resto re it by applying a P ortland cem ent m ortar plaster Of
    prim e im portance in resu rfacing silo interiors is the thorough cleaning
    of the surface prior to operations P ortland cem ent w ashes are readily
    applied with a soft broom or calcim ine brush The wash is m ade by m ixing
    Portland cem ent preferably of the w aterproof type with w ater to a cream y
    paint consistency; it should be stirred frequently during use to keep the
    cem ent from settling and should be applied in a sm ooth even coating heavy
    enough to fill all depressions W alls should be thoroughly wet for a t least
    two hours before applying the wash The addition of finely powdered iron in
    the proportion of one pound of iron to each four pounds of cem ent ap p ears
    to increase the d u rability and acid resistance of the wash Pow dered iron
    containing sal am m oniac is preferable since it hasten s oxidation As soon
    as the w ash has set sufficiently the su rface should be sprinkled a t
    intervals to keep it m oist for two days in o rder to cure F o r deeply
    etched surfaces P o rtlan d cem ent m o rtar plaster is recom m ended This
    surface should be prepared as for the cem ent w ash tre a tm e n t and the
    walls thoroughly dam pened for at least two hours before applying the finish
    A good m o rta r is m ade with one sack of P ortland cem ent 10 pounds of
    hyd rated lime and two and a half cubic feet of clean well graded plaste r
    sand with enough w ater to give a good plastering consistency The first coat
    should average about onefourth inch thickness and should be allowed to cure
    at least 24 hours before the second coat is applied provided th at a second
    coat is applied provided that a second coat is necessa ry to obtain a good

    hot breads at homem ore quickly than ever before Thus home baking follows
    the trend of the tim es and becom es quickbaking One reason why m odern hom

    has been the difficulty of obtaining a leavening agent th a t was both

    ajority of peo j Yeast is the m ost satisfactory pie throughout the ]
    leavening agent for bread and rolls H eretofore only two types had been
    available F resh or com pressed yeast and dried yeast Both of these products

    days Dry yeast keeps several weeks at room tem p eratu re and has therefore
    been regarded as m ore practical Its g reat disadvantage has been th a t it

    Manure for W heat Fields Is Strongly Recommended If clover or alfalfa is to
    be interseeded next spring it is advisable to give w heat fields a light
    blanket of m anure this winter Excepting on soils so rich that w heat is apt
    to lodge m anuring alw ays is likely to be beneficial It is p articu larly
    advisable on ground th a t is low in fertility too drouthy or som ew hat too
    acid for obtaining good stands of legum e hay crops Com parisons m ade at
    the Ohio experim ent station showed th at even on acid soil red clover
    yielded 94 per cent alfalfa 71 per cent and sw eet clover 66 per cent as
    much as on lim ed land when the w heat land was top dressed in advance with
    m anure In contrast acid soil th at had not been so m anured grew only 70
    per cent as m uch red clover hay only 25 per cent as much alfalfa and only
    16 per cent as much sw eet clover as on limed land Record U S Hay Crop A
    1938 hay crop of 92000000 tons the larg est in 10 years and one of the larg
    est on recordis reported by the United S tates departm ent of agriculture
    The 1937 crop was 83 000000 tons and the 192736 av erage (including several
    drouth years) w as less than 80000000 tons The crop together with last sp
    rin g s farm carryover stocks of nearly 13000000 tons m akes the second larg

    average sum e som e form of bread toast or wellbaked rolls a t every m eal
    These easily digested foods supply tbe fuel values th at m ost active
    youngsters require in abundance Rolls and bread with a wellbaked crust have
    the additional advantage of encouraging thorough m astication During
    adolescence the energy requirem ents a re especially high Boys som etim es
    eat m ore than their fathers and it is desirable that the ex tra calories be
    provided in the form of such easily digested and wholesome foods as
    breadstuffs This is also an advantage to the hom em aker from the point of
    view of economy as breadstuffs rank as one of our m ost reasonably priced
    foods Adolescent girls on the other hand frequently develop finicky
    appetites and stran g e food habits They may wish to go to school without
    breakfast a p ractice which m ust be discouraged as it m ay lead to un
    dernutrition from which nerv es m ay develop Adolescents Like Variety One
    way to help growing girls to be energetic is to encourage them to eat som e
    form of bread at every m eal This will help to keep up the fuel value of the
    diet at very little expense M others m ust however guard against loss of in
    terest in bread : stuffs by various m em bers of their fam ilies as a result
    of monotony Luckily there is no reason why this should occur in any home For
    it is possible to provide breadstuffs in such a variety th at the sam e kind
    need not be served twice in succession within the space of one or two weeks
    You can add variety to the d i e t by preparing bread from grah am whole w
    heat or rye flour Rolls j can be m ade from plain o r sw eet j dough Some of
    the m ore popular are P ark er House rolls sandw ich j rolls finger rolls
    cinnam on buns i butterscotch rolls and pecan rolls A New Leavening Agent
    Some hom em akers m ay feel ( th at it is too costly to purchase | such
    fancy breads Outside the home And they m ay feel that they cannot sp a re
    the tim e rej quired for hom e baking Such ar ; gum ents m ight have been
    valid in j the past But not any m orel both white and whole w heat flour
    with seeded uncooked prunes re frig erato r rolls coffee cakes raisin bread
    wholesome raised doughnuts waffles and buckw heat cakes It cannot be denied
    th a t bread is one of the oldest foods known to m an But ju st to prove th
    at even our m ost basic foods m ay be improved along com es this
    revolutionary y east to provide a leavening th at is m ore satisfactory than
    ever before perhaps to homem akers all over the country (ft W N U C H o u
