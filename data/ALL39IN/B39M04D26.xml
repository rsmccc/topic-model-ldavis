55 TH Wedding Anniversary
Wide Interest in Alumni Directory
There continues to be interest expressed from away in the high schoo
alumni directory which is being planned
by the committee in charge
Work is going along nicely on the
directory and more names and addresses
are coming in all the time
E E Homstad chairman o f the
committee received a letter from
Miss Olava H Gullord o f Madison
who had noticed through the BJ
that they were working on the directory
She sent a dollar to purchase
copies She will receive four
for that amount as the plan is to
have the directories sell for 25 cents
each Miss Gullord also passed along
some interesting information Her
mother is 84 years old and remarkably
active for her age but her hearing is beginning to fail Her sister
Miss Elizabeth graduate o f our high
school is teaching mathematics at the
Whitewater high school Her brother
P W Gullord is a druggist at
Greenwood as is well known here All
three are graduates o f our high
school Miss Olava has been secrertarial
clerk in the office o f the secretary
o f the University faculty since
1916
C C Mulrine superintendent o f
Whitefish Bay public schools thinks
it will be a splendid idea and one
that will be greatly appreciated to
get out the directory o f graduates He
sent Verne Nichols address said he
was a neighbor and also sent his own
address That is the stuff and pleasing
to the committee A ny one who
will do the same will be appreciated
i f there i any question o f their proper
address
 Mrs A C Teeters formerly Minnie
Laura Nelson is now living at
Swan River Minn and is much in terested
in the directory She states
that her name was misspelled in the
old directory so she thought she
would be early in reporting on this
She also sent the address o f her sister
Mrs Sidney Lake formerly Miss
Martha Margaret Nelson now living
in Groton South Dakota She wished
them success in the work
I f the directory does nothing else
than let us hear from a few of the
old graduates like the above it is
serving a good purpose No wonder
so many are interested in it and wish
the work well

Burial services for Mrs B L Kelley
Taylor were held from the home
at 2 30 Thursday April 20 1939
Mrs Kelley passed away at the farm
home 16 miles west of Black River
Falls at 10 30 Monday morning April
17 1939
She had been failing gradually in
strength and activity for a considerable
time but with advancing years
the friends did not attribute it to
wasting disease until the beginning of
June 1938 From then on until the
final summons came she relinquished
day by day some portion o f her responsibility
to home and friends yet
rallying to the joys o f social contacts
with intimate friends even within a
week o f her going
On November 17 1938 the subject
of this sketch completed 64
years of citizenship in the state of
Wisconsin having been born in A lbany
(township) in 1874 She was
the daughter of James Henry Ludington
and Leah I Bucklin residents of
Green and Rock counties after coming
with their parents when young
from New York state in the pioneer
days
She was married to Bert L Kelley
son of a pioneer family in Brooklyn
(township) Green county November
2 1895 and he remains to mourn
his loss without children of his own
to sustain him their marriage having
been without issue But he is not
entirely bereft for 36 years ago this
spring Mr Kelley cooperated valiently
in the care o f the wife s nephew
and three nieces who were left motherless
Three o f the fo ur are here to
comfort him in his loneliness but
when the infant after six years
knowing the aunt as Mama Moie 
(Myrta) and the uncle as Unkie 
left them to be with her own mother
their grief was immeasurable
Shortly after they moved to Taylor
purchasing the S K Bergseth
farm one mile east of the village
Again in their later life Mr and
Mrs Kelley gave a home and parental
oversight to a 13yearold boy
Henry Abernathy who is present to
help with counsel and physical aid
Mrs Kelley was a courageous and
capable farm woman a lover of music
and flowers and home a serious
reader and a helpful neighbor She
was a longtime member of Royal
Neighbors and of Eastern Star both
societies contributing to the final obsequies
the latter s representatives
from Black River lodge conducting
the service of their ordr with music
The Rev Schroeder officiated with a
portion of the Presbyterian burial
rites Mrs Kelley having been associated
with that denomination during
the latter years o f local church functioning

The following account o f their interesting
lives is taken from the
Galesville correspondence in the La
Crosse Tribune 
far
B ug gy T rip Marked W e d d in g of
Gale P air 50 Years Ago
Though Mr and Mrs Stoltz have
been residents o f Galesville for but
a little more than a year memories
of old Galesville remain with the former
who as a boy was a student at
the old Galesville university when
that school thrived as a military academy
in the days o f Lieut John
Clem A fter living in Jackson county
from birth until March 1938 the
couple came to Galesville to retire
settling on the upper table where they
already have many friends
The marriage of Daniel Stoltz and
Miss Margaret Mulry occurred at E ttrick
April 16 1889 They were
married at the Catholic parsonage by
Father Burns then pastor o f the
congregation when the church was a
h alf mile from town The couple accompanied
by Katie McLaughlin and
Cook Stoltz the latter a cousin o f the
bridegroom o f that day drove from
the Taylor vicinity were married and
returned the same day
The teamandbuggy trip was their
wedding tour the Stoltz said They
had a team but the attendants followed
in a buggy drawn by one horse
The trip took three hours each way
the couple recalled in a day when
improved roads were unknown Seven
miles an hour was good speed for
their vehicles they recalled
From that day on the couple
farmed on the place originally settled
by Mr Stoltz parents Mr and
Mrs George Stoltz Golden weddings
sort o f run in our family  observed
the husband o f 1889 His parents celebrated
their 50th anniversary too
with considerable pomp and lived 10
years more fo r good measure though
none o f their subsequent anniversaries
were formally observed
Three children were bom to the
couple The two living are Irene now
Mrs Karl Wieland o f Hillsboro Mo
and Paul now o f Grand Marais
Minn A third child George oldest
of the three was a victim o f a
scourge o f diphtheria and died in
his father s arms on his eighth birthday
The couple has two grandchildren
George Stoltz Wieland and Mary
Therese Wieland children o f their
daughter The Wieland family and
Mr and Mrs Stoltz are expected to
arrive Thursday or Friday and will
complete arrangements for their parents 
anniversary
Mr Stolts born on the Stoltz farm
midway between Taylor and Hixton
completed the district school and came
to Galesville to enroll in the then
thriving Galesville university the
only scnool of higher learning in the
area at that time He boarded at
private homes for the school then
had but a single building the old
 main hall o f later days He recalls
but few homes now remaining others
of that day having been razed or remodeled
beyond recognition The
Van Slyke home now occupied by
the Henry Gallup family the present
Walter Thomas home then occupied
by President J  Edwin Smith o f the
school the Tibbitts home now property
o f the Helleckson estate and
the home occupied by the Kenyon
family where Lieut Clem boarded
remain in his memory o f that period
Drilling for military practice was
the chief pastime if so it may be
called at the school Outofdoors on
the campus where two cannon marked
the school as a military one and
where the accoutrements o f warfare
included guns o f various types and
indoors in severe weather the students
drilled in addition to their regular
studies The third floor o f the
school was then a single room or hall
and made a space large enough for
drills as carried on by Clem who be
fore his death a few years ago became
M ajor General
After completing his studies at the
school the young man was fp anted
a teacher s certificate but instead
chose farm ing as his work
Mrs Stoltz as Margaret Mulry was
b om and reared but three miles from
the home o f her future husband They
were acquaintances all their lives
they say Mrs Stoltz was b om on
May 27 1868 and will observe her
71st birthday shortly after the 76th
anniversary o f her husband s birth
Mr Stoltz is one o f two remaining
members in his family A brother

A sister Mrs Martha McCumber
died at her home in Bellingham
Wash a month ago Mrs Stoltz has
two brothers and a sister James

C O O P E R A T IV E N EWS 
By Earl Horswill
According to information published
in the Christian Century magazine 
615 cents o f the consumers dollar
spent for ten major food items
in the United States goes to the processor
and distributor and 385 cents
goes to the farmer 
In Denmark it is almost exactly opsite
for when a Dane spends a dolar
for the same food items 634
cents goes to the farmer and 366
cents to the distributor and processor
This economic condition has been
brought about by a system of education
and cooperation and has reduced
the farm tenancy from 45 per cent
to less than 4 per cent
Contrast that with conditions here
in the United States About onehalf
o f our farmers or about 3000000
farm families are settling down to a
social state of serfdom heretofore foreign
to our great country
Almost 2000000 more with their
farm home heavily mortgaged struggle
on under the burden o f debt
hoping that a kind Providence will
somehow save them from a like fate 
That leaves less than 2000000 families
of the nation s once proud group
o f independent home owning farmers
remaining and their ranks are thinning
every year
Denmark at one time was a hard
pressed nation through unwise alliances
with other countries She sided
in with Napoleon and in 1807 her
fleet was destroyed in the battle of
Copenhagen In 1814 Norway was
taken from Denmark and united with
Sweden as compensation for Finland
which was taken from Sweden and
joined to Russia In 1864 the two
largest and richest provinces were annexed
to Germany and we bought the
Danish West Indies in 1916 As a
result o f these losses the population
was reduced trade ruined and the
country was heavily in debt The army
and navy were reduced to a mere
skeleton police force and today Denmark
is practically unprotected from
outside foes She believes there is a
moral protection in complete disarmament
The land was held by large feudal
landowners They had a series of
droughts and epidemics among the
cattle America became a strong competitor
with its wheat and Germany
had closed its doors by high ta r iff on
cattle the two principal crops o f that
time I t was a country slowly sinking
in despair facing a national and
economical bankruptcy
The tide began to turn however
in the seventies when the practical
philosopher Bishop Grundtvig (1783
1872) who worked in the middle of
the last century aroused the farm
people o f Denmark to a frame o f
mind which started them to realize
that they must trust each other and
work together Bishop Grundtvig instigated
the Folk Schools in Denmark
and they have furnished rural Denmark
with a homegrown trained leadership
of open minded disciples who
have dared to try new methods This
educational system has been the
greatest single factor in the development
of the cooperative movement in
Denmark
Judgin g Denmark by the well being
o f its people it is now one o f the
wealthy countries o f the world The
cities have no slums as we have in
the United States it has no widespread
want Neither have they any
multimillionaires The average working
class home is fitted with gas and
electricity which are both cheap
There are electricity and telephones
in nearly every farm home and many
rural homes have central heating
plants
The Danish people have virtually
lifted themselves out o f an economic
and social chaos by their own bootstraps
Through this system o f education
and cooperation their agricultural
products have won an uncontested
place in the markets of the
world
The common people o f our nation
both rural and urban are beginning
to realize that they too can control
their own economic conditions and
when our farmers receive 634 cents
o f the consumer s dollar as they do
in Denmark the farmers will again
own the land they till and the present
widespread want will cease
F J Bowman closed a deal last
Thursday whereby Mrs Katherine
Carroll of B R Falls became the
owner o f the Joseph Bullock property
at Fairchild I t consists of a beautifu
l sixroom stucco coated dwelling
house large poultry house garage
and 3 94 acres o f land all cultivated
rich fertile black soil ideal for berry
culture and poultry all fenced
with woven wire I t is located on the
west side o f the village o f Fairchild
just across the line in E au Claire
county I t will make a nice home for
Mrs Carroll her son and two daughters
They will take possession imme

The struggle of the world s natural
resources has again brought Europe
to the brink of war Germany and
Italy are demanding a more equitable
share o f the earth s raw materials
and are apparently willing to risk a
modem slaughter to get it Japan for
several months now has been busy
conquering China for the same thing
In this struggle it is always the
 haves against the have nots  it
is the countries with large populations
and limited resources who attack the
nations with large possessions
I t is interesting to note that the
haves are the contented peoples
the free nations with democratic governments
while the have nots are
usually the peoples whose discontent
has brought them under the yoke of
the dictator The simple truth is
this liberty and plenty go hand in
hand
W ith these plain but powerful facts
before us we in America should pause
for a brief appreciation of the present
state of our existence We find
ourselves the richest the most contented
of all other humans on the
earth and we have a government that
pves its people a measure o f personal
iberty found nowhere else among
the civilized nations
Would the seed of Liberty that was
planted at Plymouth by the Pilgrims
have developed into our mighty Democrary
had it fallen on less fertile
soil Would this government have
weathered all the storms of adversity
had starvation and real humanwant
been added to the hardships o f the
past It is easy enough for a government
to govern when life within
its borders goes on like a song but
come hunger and scarcity of human
needs then look out
We have heard it said that American
Democracy is declining that perhaps
some day we too will have a dictator
This will never be true I am
sure as long as ours remains the land
o f plenty but will it always be this
same country of boundless resources
For while we are the most free we
are at the same time the most wasteful
of all peoples on the face of the
earth We have destroyed vast forests
with no thought or provision for
the future We are using up our
petroleum and coal deposits at a terrific
rate hoping that when they are fone we will be able to find more
he commercial fishes o f our great
lakes and boundary waters are depleted
wild life and game fish are
only remnants of what they were
O ur fertile soil greatest of all of
nature s gifts has been sadly mishandled
because freedom o f the individual
and proper land use will not
hitch This misuse of land has caused
erosion by wind and water that
has destroyed in a few short years
great areas of fertility that it took
ages of time to create
I f we cherish our democracy and
our freedom we must take measures
to conserve and restore our natural
resourves Conservation is probably
the most important problem we have
to deal with it is the greatest chal
lenge to the intelligence and will o f
the American people For just as
sure as it was abundance or natural
resources that gave us our liberty in
the past so it will be conservation of
these gifts that will in the future
keep us free

Suppose you keep a 100 checking
balance If you invested 100 it would
hardly earn saiely today more than 400
in a year O n the other hand your 100
checking balance would save you in
money order fees time and effort it
would give you protection convenience ]
bookkeeping and other services worth
far more than 400 a year
Paying by check is a wise thrifty way
of handling your financial affairs We

Road conditions unbelievably bad on the Trempealeau Trail near the Merrillan
end of the MerrillanWinona route are pictured above
On this stretch of highway according to George T Ringrose Alma Center executive
secretary of the Trempealeau Trail Association the state aind federal governments
year after year conduct fu tile and p itifu l experiments in surfacing the road with
a thin coat of black top or bituminous material which is broken and ground up each
spring into a quagmire impossible to travel until all trace o f the surfacing sinks into
peat marshland and disappears
Why Trempealeau T rail Association Is Aroused to Fever Pitch
The pictures o f highway 95 state trunk were taken April 1 as part o f a verified
photographic survey of road conditions which will be kept on file to sustantiate claims
of residents of the area that the state and federal governments are treating the residents
of the rich Trempealeau Valley area unfairly i n failing to provide the area with
a good Concrete road on an important crossstate arterial
In such stretches o f road as are shown above said Guyal A Buckley a driver of
the MerrillanW moma bus his bus has been mired so deeply that the combined power
of horses and tractors could not pull it out and for long periods of time the highway
has been impassible except by long detours between Blair and Taylor and also often
between Alma Center and Merrillam and Taylor and Hixton
Sticks stones and whole logs are often used by bus and truck drivers and passenger
car drivers in vain attempts to fill up the worst spots so that a crossing can be made
he declared and some of the photos above show logs in the deep furrows in the highway

With this issue we commemorate a
century o f existence
While there is no documentary evidence
o f the founding or first settlement
here by Robert Douglas April
13 1839 it is undisputable that the
above date is correct
We have it from our pioneer and
local historian A D Polleys who
doubtless is the only person now living
who has it from the lips of Robert
Douglas that the above date is
the date of the coming of the first
white man
Douglas arrived at Prairie La
Crosse from Prairie du Chien on the
steamboat Osprey on the 9th and
four days later he staked out a
 squatter s claim of about 1100
acres as a permanent habitation
The government survey of 1846
dispossessed him of his right which
he regained in part by purchase of a
portion of his original holdings He
gave to his private estate the name
of Dumfries his native town in Scotland
but in a general way it was
known as Douglas Settlement
It bore that name until time and
c i r cumstances brought about a
change During the early 50 s his
brother Hugh Douglas having come
into possession of large holdings on
the upper table platted a village
which he chose to name Bristol for a
thriving city in England by that
name
On A pril 1 1856 a town organization
was effected which was given
the same name as was a post office
On Jan 3 1860 the name o f the
town was changed to that of Melrose
at the suggestion of Hugh Douglas
by the county board and named Melrose
for a city in Scotland and the
post office also assumed the same
name
I t is difficult to realize that only a
century ago the wild animals gamboled
at will over the terrian not
knowing what a white man looked
like The birds of the air likewise
with billions of wild pigeons in dense
and endless flocks going over
The first frame barn built by the
first settler in 1849 was blown down
by a storm a year ago The first
frame residence built in 1852 by him
is partially left
Our community is not making any
formal observance of its century of
progress and it is hard to believe
such development could come about
in that space o f time
We expect to participate in the
coming county observance of the
Centennial if the promoters so desire
O f all the numerous members of
the pioneer Douglas family Arthur
Douglas retired of the village of
Melrose son of the first settler is the
only descendent residing here Melrose

4H C lub
On Wednesday April 19th 25 4H
club members reported at Castle
Mound for the 4H club tree planting
demonstration Wm McNeel assistant
4H club leader Madison was
present to discuss the care of seedlings
the planting o f seedlings and
transplants and to demonstrate the
methods used in planting seedling in
the transplant beds and transplants in
the final location
The 4H club members assisted in
planting Norway Pine transplants in
the section which had been plowed
by the Conservation department for
planting purposes Some transplanting
was also done in the section planted
by club members last spring Last
year s planting seemed to survive the
summer and winter months much better
than the plantings of other years
The 30000 seedlings ordered by
4H club members were distributed
during the week to the 96 club members
who are enrolled in the regular
forestry project These seedlings
have been planted in seedling beds
in the garden where they will remain
for two years after which they may
be transplanted for wind breaks or
other purposes Each year club members
will be encouraged to order trees
for seedling beds in order that they
may have a continuous supply of
transplants on the farm The seedlings
this year consisted of White
Norway Scotch and Jack pines
Black Locust Norway and White
Spruce
Those who assisted with the demonstration
planting included Violet

Homemaker 
The project leaders of the 23 homemakers
clubs in the county attended
the demonstration on House Cleaning
conducted by Margaret McCordic
Home Management specialist last
Wednesday and Thursday at Hixton
and Black River Falls Due to the
fact that the demonstration on House
Cleaning covers such a variety of
work that homemakers clubs could
easily spend two meetings giving the
demonstrations the leaders decided
not to hold a fifth demonstration
meeting or the A nnual Achievement
Day
A ll club secretaries and presidents
will soon be asked to attend a meeting
at Black River Falls at which time
the 19391940 homemakers program
will be selected

Perhaps you have had your radio
so long that the novelty has worn off
but ours is new enough to still be an
exciting adventure whenever we turn
the dial Explorations among the
numbers along that dial have led us
to marvel at the ease with which we
to many treats and we cannot cease
can tune in on all the big events the
world over In the past few weeks
we have listened to speakers in Germany
Roumania Italy Japan E ngland
and Ireland to name only a
few and the persons we followed
through newspaper accounts have become
real personalities since we can
hear them actually speaking One of
the things I especially appreciate is
the chance to learn pronunciation of
difficult and uncommon words Heretofore
I pronounced them by guessing
and invariably it was the wrong
guess! There is such an unlimited
variety to the programs church music
on WCCO at 8 30 each week day
for the religious abookaweek on
W G N at 3 45 for the literary marriage
licenses and real marriages at
2 p m over W G N for the romantically
inclined and for any one who
likes a variety o f interesting interviews
there is Florence Lehmann on
WCCO at 3 p m each day And oh!

K nocking the Church
Mr H G Weils says Jesus Christ
is easily the dominant figure of all
history  No one can deny that he is
 the holiest among the mighty and
the mightiest among the holy  as
Fairbairn declares The Book which
tells His story is the world s only permanent

partly Decause wnen a man
oeats ius wire it makes a startling
news item and partly Decause unthinking
criticism is tne mood o i tne
nour m e Churcn nas survived many
attacks ana weathered tne cnanging
centuries remarkaDiy well Constructive
criticism is always ia ir and tne
Church has no desire to evade or
avoid it The cheaper sorts o i criticism
gets us nowhere And it is only
la ir to say that nobody kicks a dead
dog Criticism is a tribute to the
worth and power o i an institution
Righteousness always runs counter to
somebody s habit or greed When the
Church speakers there are some
whether politicians promoters sinners
or whatnot who do not like the
principles for which the Church
stands Then they criticize As fa r as
they are concerned the Church may
comfort the sorrowing aid the needy
worship God and strengthen the morally
weak but it must not rebuke the
sinner
Particularly does a certain type of
mind like to call attention to the hypocrites
within the Church They are
there to be sure but not all of them
are m the Church The Church has
no monopoly on those who seek its
shelter and share its privileges but
are unworthy of its life No man
avoids the pharisees and parasites by
staying outside the Church for they
get into clubs and lodges business associations
trade organizations and
everywhere else They are a very
common human pest limited to no
sect race or country
The man who reads history knows
that the Church has always been attacked
 sometimes with reason oftener
with rancor Its enemies have
proclaimed its downfall The wish
was father to the thought Their
prophesies are ridiculous today in
the light of history and of scientific
accuracy They have not even been
accompanied by any constructive alternative
They tore down but they
did not show how to build up And
the Christian can still sing 
 O where are kings and empires now
O f old that went and came
But Lord thy Church is praying yet
Two thousand years the same 
jfet not the same in one sense
For the church is ever changing That
is its glory An old iarmer said to
a friend passing by Si ain t the man
he used to be And his friend replied 
 No and he never was And
the Church 1 knew as a boy is not the
same as the one I know today indeed
it never was! It has changed
and so have I But after giving the
Church every bit of support I knew
how for more than four decades and
my whole life for two decades I have
no word to say save that if I had my
life to live again I d give the Church
more rather than less For the
Church is far and away the greatest
force for righteousness in the world
today among all institutions save
one alone the Christian home I will
back its leaders and members against
any other organization that can be
named for sheer moral idealism patriotism
and unselfish helpfulness to
the world s life I am willing to a ffirm
and to defend that position anywhere
any time
During the evolution of human
thought the shift of vast populations
and the destructions of war the
Church has shown a resiliency a power
o f adaptation and a growing
strength which prove its vitality ana
the reality of the things for which it
stands It has life Life is perpetually
changing its forms but is not ending
its existence Men mistake change
for decay Ever the new lifs nuts
on new forms in thought types of
service adaptability to each new age
The Church is today the best outward
symbol of religion in the quality of
its life and the scope of its ministries
It is a good barometer of civilization
as well as of religion It is
beyond all other agencies the promoter
of religion Mr Will Hays has
said Religion is the one essential industry
in the United States Get
that word essential No other organization
on earth is exclusively devoted
to proclaiming the gospel to
all mankind exalting the worship of
the one true God and laboring for
the progress of knowledge the promotion
o f justice the reign of peace
and the realization of human brotherhood 
 Lacky the historian was
justified in asking what other institution
in Europe had done anything
nearly as much for humanity as the
Church Judged by the standards of
any age its ideals have been the
highest Its failures have been those
of our common human nature which
is always and ever in need of divine
help
The Church is engaged in the business
of keeping the soil o f the world
alive Its power is in its life and not
in its forms Its continued existence
is due in part to human needs For
as Silverster Horne said So long as
the mystery of human spirit remains 
and the marvel of conversion and
the needed application of Christ s
teachings to each new day and the
world bristles with armed camps 
so long will it need the message
which the Church is trying to proclaim
exemplify and interpret the
message of Jesus Christ  The Church
seeks to make clear the teachings and
imperatives of Jesus
This is big business It is business
worth sharing worth any man s or
woman s investment of time iponey
and life itself

ous observance and spectacle than to

It is better to give the institutions
of religion a square deal than to
sneer at their aim to help mankind
stifle their calls to purity and peace
and hamper their endeavors to culti
 ate Christian ideals and character
That is one reason why a great
mercantile establishment is n o t
ashamed in its anniversary advertising
in great city newspapers to a ffirm
its reliance in the foundation
principles of religion For these
bear in mind the Church primarily
stands There is no asset of business
or of the world s varied life more
important than the Churches They
build the unseen foundations honor
justice purity unselfish service for
God and for humanity W ithout
these civilization is a sham and life
a disaster
Abraham Lincoln said in his generation 
 When any Church will inscribe
over its altar as its sole qualification
for membership the Savior s
condensed statement of the substance
o f both law and gospel Thou shalt
love the Lord the God with all thy
heart and with all thy soul and with
all thy mind and thv neighbor as
thyself that Church will I join with
all my heart and all my soul 
Friend is your Church that kind
o f a Church I f not hy not I f not
has it after all much excuse or justification
for further continuing Have
you been doing all you really could
for the success and prosperity and
growth and extended influence and
effectiveness o f yo ir Church Or
have you been among those who
everlastingly gently or not so gently
knock the Church Friend Think
on these things

IN CLO V E RD A L E
In Cloverdale are hollyhocks
And irises and choicest phlox
And crimson poppies all aglow
And flaming cosmos row on row
Here angels stand in mute disguise
Their trumpets lifted to the skies
And from each deep and fragrant
throat
A mystic anthem seems to float
Mossrose creeps over garden rocks
And farther on the fouro clocks
Stand clustered at the garden gate
Reminding us the day is late
In Cloverdale are drowsy heads
And vesper prayers and trundle beds
And through the twilight borne along
The accents o f a cradle song
In Cloverdale are miles and miles
O f yesterdays and afterwhiles
And hope and love all buried low
W ith forms we cherished long ago
I launch my bark on tangled streams
O f vanished dreams and memory
gleams
And steer away to distant isles
That once were bright with friendly
smiles
And here I join a youthful throng
That laughs its happy way along
Till once again I take the oar
And steer back to the homeward
shore
So here I stand amid the phlox
Petunias and hollyhocks
And find no dream of bygone days
So lovely as the lovely ways
O f motor track and forest trail
That lead me back to Cloverdale

A t least one individual and possibly
more in Washington seems or
seem to have no little curiosity about
mail received by congressmen or else
labor under the apprehension that our
communications are loaded down with
valuables in some form or another
Upon a recent Sunday night the o ffices
o f several members including
that of the writer were entered and
the Saturday night and Sunday morning
letter deliveries were captured
and carried away The next morning
several hundred letters were found
in one o f the rest rooms where the
thief or thieves had opened their find
Whether or not they took any letters
with them will not be discovered until
some of the writers of the letters get
impatient over not receiving replies
to their missives and write their representatives
to learn why the delay
The first raid on the office mails
seems not to have been sufficient for
the perpetrators of the burglary
Though postal authorities and capital
police guarded the building to insure
against repetition of mail robbery on
the succeeding Sunday evening another
foray occurred and the offices
o f several other representatives were
entered and scores of letters were
carried off The offenders apparently
were more hurried and took their
loot outside the building to open But
few of the letters on the latter raid
were found scattered along one of the
corridors The letter mail of members
is generally heavy the last of the
week and few members visit the offices
on Sundays and practically
none on Sunday evenings The big
building with 500 office rooms is
well policed In each instance the
thieves gained entrance by a pass key
or some other method which was not
evident The loss o f mail causes no
little concern to the members who
have no way o f knowing by whom
the stolen letters were sent Additional
precautions are being taken
against further raids as police continue
their search for the Sunday
night mail robbers
The president s letter urging peace
upon European dictators continues to
be a leading topic of discussion here
as well as elsewhere while the replies
o f his addressees are held in abeyance
That the headstrong bosses
abroad will accept the mediation he
suggested is unlikely but his message
has had the effect of at least accomplishing
temporary suspension of that
acute feeling that possibly an undeclared
war  which is the latest
fashion in wars already had begun
There is one other factor arguing
for peace which may be having no
little effect and that is the summer
excursion traffic to Europe by the
people of this country Notwithstanding
the depression that travel has
been increasing in recent years due
to extensive advertising and lowered
travel rates The countries of western
Europe have profited immensely
through this traffic the tourists leaving
hundreds of millions of good
American dollars abroad Our tourist
trade with Italy fo r instance affords
that country more money than does
the export of its commodities to this
country W ith the war scare on there
promises to be a great decline in the
summer excursion trade from our
shores and most European countries
are laboring under such economic
difficulties that the loss of that trade
would be serious to many lines o f
business Were our government to
suddenly increase our passport fees
to a sizeable amount instead of the
present minor sum there would be
more than one Atlantic steamship line
running in the red It is estimated
that in normal times American tourists
spend more than h a lf a billion
dollars on summer excursions to E u rope
The rather mysterious movement
o f our war fleet from the Atlantic to
the Pacific immediately following the
president s letter to the dictators is
attracting attention in connection
with the war scare No reason has
been assigned by the department for
the sudden change of plan as the intention
had been announced to have
the fleet as a drawing card at the
opening of the World Fair at New
York next month One naval officer
apparently indiscreet has talked out
o f school to the effect that the
movement has an international aspect
in that it means a warning to Japan
at the same time that European navies
are being placed in strategic positions
overseas Warning Japan at the
same time that we are supplying that
country with money and materials for
crushing China may seem odd Japan
sank the Panay a year ago and
apologized for the incident without
paying the damages It is alleged that
the Panay outrage was anticipated by
our government as a move to test our
attitude Had an embargo on war
materials been declared at that time
there would have been no further
need o f warning Japan
The flow of foreign gold into our
ports and safety vaults continues as
our holdings approximate close to 16
billions In another four months at
the present rate it will be nearly seventeen
billions In part this huge gold
surplus may be coming to finance purchases
o f materials in case war occurs
abroad Some is coming as a
measure o f safety for European
banks individuals and governments
Another reason is that the world
production of gold is increasing rapidly
In 193S the mines o f the world
produced 9455000 ounces more than
in 1934 when our purchase policy
fixed the new price of 35 per ounce
The increased value of that production
was 331000000 During the
four years more than a billion dollars
worth was added to the world supply
Newer methods o f mining as well
as our fixed price have accelerated
production permitting the profitable
operation o f mines whose ores formerly
were regarded as too lean to be
mined A t the same rate o f increase
the next four years production will
be nearly double that o f 1934 and
most o f it will continue to come into
our storage places if our gold buying
policy is continued By that time our
country will have so much gold and
other countries so little that the question
o f what to do with our surplus
gold may become as big a problem as
9ie present T hat to do with our surplus
cotton M E R L IN HULL

Hastings (Helen Hagen) has gone
back on him What would you do in
his place
Eunice Nordahl as Mrs Hastings
Smith and Millard Bills as Leroy
her son try to swindle Marian out
of her fortune but just can t seem to
get away with it
Last but not least is Amanda
Whitaker (E lvina Nerby) who claims
to be only 28 years old but her
brother Ebenezer (E arl Kleba) says
she is two years older than he who
is 55
We must not forget Miss Veeder
who is our able coach and assistant
Sometimes she entertains her friend
at play practice and altho it isn t
in the play it proves to be great entertainment
fo r the cast
Thanks for the time
