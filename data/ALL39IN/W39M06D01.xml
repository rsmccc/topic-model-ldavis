Oppressive Taxes
Charging that “ oppressive” income
and inheritance taxes are responsible
fo r the flig h t of wealthy Wisconsin
residents from the state, Senator Harry
W. Bolens, Port Washington Democrat,
has asked fellow senators if it
was not “ high time something was being
done before the damage is beyond
repair.”
Speaking on a point o f personal privilege
before the senate Senator
Bolens cited from a release by the
state tax commission, said to have
been prepared by that body at the request
o f the Governor’s office, statistics
which show that since 1920, 151#
persons with five-yea r average incomes
o f more than $25,000 a year
have established residence in other
states.
Bolens pointed out that the men included
in the list were those who had
helped build Wisconsin industry, and
that their departure from iWsconsin
meant an annual loss o f $300,000 in
income taxes and a prospective loss of
33 million dollars in inheritance taxes.
The senator said Florida got 38 of
those who moved away, Illinois 32,
California 21), New Y ork 11, Michigan
7 and scattered states the remainder.
“ The income and inheritance tax
laws o f Wisconsin are higher than any
surrounding state. It is not necessary
to go a thousand miles from home to
set*k relie f from oppressive Wisconsin
tax laws. One need only cross the
Illinois line to save half o f the inheritance
taxes,” the senator said.
Senator Risser, Madison Progressive,
said he was amused at the speech,
because Bolens had voted to abolish
the state department o f commerce
which was preparing a comparative
tax survey that would report “ impartial
facts ami figu res instead of
a partisan analysis.” He asked if
Bolens was sending out a feeler fo r a
state sales tax.
Bolens is the author o f an amendment
to the present inheritance tax
law which would allow the deduction
o f federal taxes from an estate before
state taxes are computed. The
measure has already passed the senate.
B
olens also has authored a bill
which w ill appropriate $10,000 to the
tax commission fo r th*1 completion of
the tax survey begun by the form er
state department of commerce. This
bill has also passed the senate and is
awaiting final action in the lower
house.
Salute The Flag
Compulsory pledge o f allegiance to
the fla g once a week in schools was
strongly opposed by educators and
supported by representatives o f
patriotic organizatio ns at the senate
hearing before the committee on education
and public w elfare. The bill has
passed the assembly.
Authored by Assemblyman Joseph
A. Schmitz, Republcan, the bill also
provides that an American fla g be displayed
on every school ground and in
every classroom. Teachers would administer
the weekly salute anti oath o f
allegiance to the fla g. There would be
a $25 fine for teachers and school
boards who fail to observe the provisions
o f the proposed law. Schmitz
told the committee that the object of
the bill is to “ uncover unpatriotic
teachers.” Representatives o f the G.
A R., A uxiliary Sons o f Union Vet
erans o f the Civil W ar, and Senator
Carl Lovelace, said they could see no
objection to the bill, but expressed regret
that such action had to be made
compulsory.
R. B. Edgerton, Madison high school
teacher, said compelling the oath
would make a “ castor oil proposition
psychologically” out o f the flag. He
declared that passage o f the bill would
help communism because it made the
salute to the fla g artificial, and added
that “ passage o f the bill is a legislative
statement that you lack confrdence
in the teachers o f the state.”
O. H. Plenzke, secretary o f the W isconsin
Education Association said the
sentiment o f the bill was good, but the
compulsory features bad. He said unpatriotic
teachers would be the firs t
to take the oath, and thus the main
purpose o f the bill would be defeated.
The senate committee a ’ter the hearing
recommended non-ccncurrence, an
indication that the bill will receive
litttle support in the sem te.
R E A Lift
Substantial majorities in both
houses o f the legislature sent on to
Governor Heil fo r his signature a bill
which is designed to give tax r tle f to
rural electrc cooperatives.
The bill if signed by Governor >Teil
will permit rural electric cooperative*
to pay a 3 per cent tax on their gross
income in lieu o f all other taxes.

Development A uthority shows that
during the past few years electric cooperatives
in rural areas have paid
aggregate taxes ranging from 10 to 37
per cent o f their gross incomes.
Backers o f the bill stated that while
the R E A cooperatives are establishing
themselves in a field which in
form er years proved unattractive to
private utilities they should be given
every consideration possible.
The bill met mild oppostion n the
senate where Senators Duel and Me-
Dermid sought to have the law apply
to all electric companies operating in
rural areas. McDermid charged that
the measure was a privilege tax and
also sought to have the measure apply
to all form s o f cooperatives. Amend-

This County Already Has 3514 Signers
Operators o f 3544 Shawano county
farms have already signed intention
sheets showing their plans for cooperating
in the 1939 federal farm program.
This number represents 88.9 per
cent o f all farms in the county according
to O. B. Hagen, chairman o f
the county agricultural conservation
committee. O. B. Hagen emphasizes
that all farm ers in the county, who
wish to earn benefit payments in this
year’s program, must sign one of
these sheets before May 1, the final
deadline. The intention sheet indicates
what the farm operat ions are expected
to be for the coming season and is not
binding upon the farm operator in any
w ay.
For the state as a whole, 158,261
plans had been signed by March 31,
O. B. Hagen stated. This represents
78.2 per cent o f all farms in Wisconsin.
W'isconsin leads the ten states of
the North Central Region in the percentage
of farmers who have signed
plans. In Minnesota 67 per cent o f all
farmers had signed by that date, in
Iowa 69.9 per cent, in Illinois 55.9,
Indiana 58.8, and in Michigan 62.7.

TWENTY-NINE SENIORS TO
GRADUATE TOMORROW
A Beautiful Commemoration
The Memorial Day exercises on
Tuesday were attended by a large
number o f people, the weather being
ideal, and the program was one o f the
most im pressive ever given in this
community. Participating organizations
w ere the Mike Darling Post of
the American Legion, the city band
and the school band, the choir of First
Lutheran church and the Boy Scouts,
and the program was carried out as
published last week. The Rev. Ralph
Hawkins gave a very fine address.
The main thought in his address was
that the United States should keep
out o f foreign entanglements and
steer clear o f everything that would
involve us in any war outside o f its
borders in which our own sovereignty
is not threatened.
The Forest Home Cemetery Association,
which sponsored the exercises,
wishes to thank every individual and
group taking part in the program for
their help in making the day’s event
such a splendid success.
Preparations fo r the W'ausau Centennial
celebration events o f June 27th
to July 4th are moving forw ard very
itapid)y.
Practically every fraternal, social
and civic club has taken over a phase
o f the preparation work, many of
them concentrating Iheir effo rts on
“ H ighlights o f a Century” , the mammoth
stage spectacle which will be
presented each evening with a cast of
600 participants.
“ Highlights o f a Century,” will be
a spectacle interesting to W'ausonians
as well as residents of Central Wisconsin.
There will be many spectacular
scenes that will appeal to dance lovers
and those who like plenty o f glow and
glamour. Other scenes will be of a
strictly historical nature and w ill por
tray thrilling instances in the past history
of this section of Wisconsin. The
largest stage setting ever constructed
in this vicinity will be used for the
occasion, a setting in fact comparable
in size to the “ Wings o f a Century”
setting used at the Chicago World's
Fair.
A special feature o f the opening
performance on June 27th w ill be the
coronation o f the Centennial Queen
and presentation of her Court o f
Honor.
Many other events such as Juvenile
Day, Civic and Historical Parade, A ir
Meet, Religious Day and Kennel Club
Show will take place during the eight
days.
Thousands o f dollars are being spent
on decorations and W'ausau is assuming
a very gallant appearance in preparation
for the big days that are to
come.
FO U R T H IN G S
Four things a man must learn to do
I f he would make his record true:
To think without confusion clearly;
T o love his fellowmen sincerely;
T o act from honest motives purely;
To trust in God and heaven securely.

Reuben Strelow Passes Requirements
for Navi Acadamey Appointment
Reuben Strelow, a graduate o f W ittenberg
High School with the class
o f 1937, has passed all scholastic requirements
making him eligible for
appointment to the United States
Naval Academy at Annapolis, M aryland.
This appointment will be made
by the United States Congressman
from thi* district, Reid Murray.
Reuben wa« named first alternate for
the appointment and due to the fact
that a boy from Marion, Wisconsin,
who was first in line failed to meet
tin* scholastic requirements, Reuben
Strelow became the favored candidate.
The Naval Academy gives one of the
best college educations in the nation
and it is the ambition of many a boy
to have the privilege o f an appointment
to this institution.

RACES:
Semitism
L a st October top film executives
m et M o vie C zar W ill H ays to discuss
how anti-Semitism m ight be
checked insofar as it affects m ovie
revenues. Last N ovem ber Father
Charles Coughlin m ade a radio
speech tem pering criticism of G erm
any’s Jewish pogrom s by com menting
that Communist persecution
o f Christians was worse. N azi
sources, he said, had told him 56
o f the 59 top men in Russia’s Com munist
party w ere Jews.
This spring cam e “ Equ ality,” a
m agazine boasting prominent “ A ry ans”
on its editorial board and dedicated
to com bating anti-Semitism.
A t the sam e tim e C ollier’s m agazine
found there was at least enough
talk about the subject to ju stify a
popularized treatise by H arvard A nthropologist
Earnest Hooton on the
J e w ’s “ highly evolved and specialized
characteristics o f mind, tem peram
ent and personality.”
R eaders o f the Hooton article
found them selves realizing that G erm
an y’s horrible pogrom s have at
G E N E R A L M O S E L E Y
"How strange . .
least m ade A m erica conscious that
there is such a problem . This realization
becam e the m ore acute
when T e xa s’ Rep. M artin Dies
brought his un-Am ericanism investigation
com m ittee back into session
with the follow in g u.isavory allegations:
M aj. Gen. G eorge Van Horn Moseley
, who retired from the arm y last
autumn a fter throwing sharp shafts
at the N ew Deal, is a ctive in a
nation-wide anti-Jewish organization.
M oseley joined a drive
financed by N ew Y o rk ’s Dudley G ilbert,
who sent “ confidential reports”
he received from a night club “ w aite
r ” to Jam es Erw in C am pbell, reserve
arm y captain of Owensboro,
K y . Cam pbell, in turn, issued reports
to “ key people” throughout
the U. S. Dies said G ilbert had no
intention of stirring up race hatred
but thought he was doing a “ patriotic
service in anticipation of a revolution.”
Sample M oseley statements reported
by the Dies com m ittee:
(1) “ Th e fa ct is that the most
serious problem confronting A m erica
today is just this problem of
the Jew and how to get rid o f his influence
definitely— locally, nationally
and internationally.”
(2) “ I f the Jew s bump m e off be
sure to see they get the credit for it
from coast to coast. I t w ill help
our cause.”
Notified o f the charges, General
M oseley abruptly closed his own
p rivate “ un-Am ericanism ” investigation
in C alifornia’ s Im perial va lley
and flew to Washington in answ
er to a Dies subpoena. His com m
ent: “ H ow strange . . . that
a patriot can discuss openly and
frankly the problem s involving Irishmen,
Italians and Germ ans . . .
but let him mention any international
‘ ism s’ or Zionism and their increasing
control of A m erica, then
he is attacked on all sides . . . even
his life m ay be threatened.”
ITALY:
Axis Breakup?
In 1914 the homeland o ( Julius
C aesar broke its triple alliance with
G erm any and Austria-Hungary because
Trentino and T rieste w ere not
forthcom ing. N ext yea r Ita ly went
to w ar on the side o f the Allies.
European history has a w ay o f repeating
itself; Benito Mussolini, who
last yea r saw everyth ing to gain in
an alliance with A dolf H itler, and
w ho has just signed a 10-year " in vin
cib le” m ilita ry pact with G erm
an y, m ay w ell be floating hefpless
against a current he cannot buck.
P la in ly top-heavy, the Rom e-Berlin
a x is nowadays gets most of its oratorica
l support from N azidom ;
though Mussolini chimes in, almost
e v e r y speech indicates he would
lik e peace w ith dem ocracies. Left
unspoken are the reasons he fear*
the man he calls friend. Reasons:
(1) I f Balkan Yugoslavia breaks
up. the area inhabited by Slovenes
is alm ost certain to be grabbed by
G erm any from it Austrian outpost.
providing the R eich with an outlet
to the A d riatic sea and thence to
the M editerranean. Much though
G erm a n y's friendship m ight be va lued,
Ita ly cannot afford to let H itler
becom e a M editerranean power.
(2) Italians dislike Russians, but
both in heritage and ambition Adolf
H itler's nation is like Soviet Russia
An allied Berlin and Moscow would
control Europe, a possibility which
grow s less rem ote as German-hating
F oreign Com m issar M axim Litvinov
retires from office and both H itler
and Stalin cease shouting at one another.
Such a pact would leave Italy
in the cold.
(3) Strong though her M editerranean
position m ay be, Ita ly is
still w eaker than the combined fleets
o f F ran ce and Britain. Mussolini
is also alarm ed at recent Anglo-
F rench gains in the Mediterranean,
especially their pacts with G reece
and Turkey. And though he counted
on Spain as an ally against dem ocracies,
Mussolini finds Generalissim
o Francisco Franco hobnobbing
too affectionately with G erm any to
his own exclusion. Franco hobnobs
also with French, Swiss and Dutch
bankers, seeking a reconstruction
loan neither Ita ly nor Germ any
can give. So fa r as Mussolini is concerned,
the Iberian peninsula is a
b igger question m ark today than one
y ea r ago.
(4) S everal times the past year
Ita ly has risked w ar to help Hitler,
first in Austria, next in Sudetenland,
next in C zech oslovak ia, then in M em
el. Each tim e the hom e folks
wondered what Ita ly would get in
return, and after one solid y ea r of
such risks they have received nothing
but barren Albania. I f H itler
m arches into Danzig and drags Ita
ly into a futile w ar, II Duce w ill
risk internal blowup.
Such are possible reasons why
F rench Am bassador Andre Francois-
Poncet m et Italian Foreign Minister
G aleazzo Ciano in R om e recently
for am icable discussion on
French-Italian trouble points. Since
m odern treaties apparently mean
nothing, there is a good chance Ita ly
m ight junk her new G erm an pact
fo r a settlem ent with F rance and
Britain. B ritain 's reluctance to
sign a treaty with Russia m ight be
founded on the hope that G erm any
and the Soviet would get together,
thereby alienating Italy.
BUSINESS:
Com petition ff anted
Under N R A the governm ent
forced industry into collusion, strict
price levels being enforced to a
point where com peting bidders usually
found their individually arrivedat
quotations identical. But since
N R A was invalidated identical quotations
have often continued, providing
Trust Buster Thurm an A r nold,
assistant attorney general.
SPAIN:
Freedom?
“ T h t law is the logical outcome of
C »■ tman v'I view, voiced ever since the
outbreak o f the Spanish uar, that fighting
there it something which concerns
only Spaniards."
Such w as the Berlin foreign office's
com m ent on Febru ary 18,
1937, when the R eich passed a law
which forbade G erm an citizens to
enter Spanish territory and participate
in G en eralissim o Francisco
Franco’s w ar against P re m ie r Juan
N egrin. In M a y o f 1939, two months
after the w ar ended, with 14,000 G erman
"vo lu n teers " just com ing home
from Spain, G erm any got around to
repealing the law.
I f Europe thought this situation
just a bit humorous, it could view
T H l'R M A N A R N O L D
. . just getting started . . .**
with what he term s prim a facie e v idence
of collusion.
That a governm ent which five
years ago fostered collusion now
fights it m ay seem inconsistent, yet
a return to orthodox business philosophy
has again m ade men believe
that competition is the life o f trade
Up before the house appropriations
sub-committee, Trust Buster Arnold
explained the justice departm ent
w ill need $520,000 m ore next fiscal
y ea r sim ply to ca rry on an antitrust
cam paign which—a fter 40
years— “ is just getting started.”
N o violent cam paign is planned.
Mr. Arnold explained, but five regional
offices w ill be opened (N ew
Y ork, Atlanta, Chicago, Oklahoma
C ity, San Francisco) and such nation-
wide investigations as that of
the oil industry w ill be co-ordinated.
With individual actions at Madison,
Wis , N ew Y o rk and on the Pacific
coast, Mr. A rn old's oil inquiry w ill
center on w hether producers must
not divest them selves o f control
of the retail filling stations, a practice
he charges is collusive in that
it holds up prices, stifling com petition.
Mr. Arnold on oil; " M y point
is that either w e are going to have
competition in the oil industry or
if that is im possible it has got to
go to congress for regulation—one
of the tw o."
F R A N C IS C O F R A N C O
H hat price dignity?
with alarm another chapter o f German-
Spanish relations now being
written. In Madrid, while Franco
forces announced all G erm an and
Italian arm s used during the w ar
(bom bers, pursuit planes, heavy artillery,
tanks, trucks, technical
equipm ent) would be retained, a
com m ittee o f 12 G erm an tradesm en
was en route from Berlin to negotiate
an econom ic and financial
treaty with Spain.
Heading the group was Dr. Helmuth
Wohltat who negotiated the
treaty with Rum ania last March.
O bservers thought Wohltat treatym
aking had reached the pattern
stage, for Spain w ill be treated just
about the w a y Rum ania was. R eich
contractors w ill build roads, railw
ays, fortifications and other m ilita
ry establishm ents fo r the new
Spain. M ore vita l, how ever, is the
gen eral provision for exchange of
Spanish raw m aterials (esp ecia lly
ores and foodstuffs') for G erm an finished
products. Thus w ill Spain be
draw n p ositively into the Rom e-
B erlin orbit.
While this w as going on, D ictator
F ran co review ed his much-postponed
" v ic t o r y ” parade, then spoke
as if his nation w ere fre e from G erm
an y and Ita ly : “ W e w ant a grea t
Spain, but w e place our dignity
above all. W e shall not tolerate
any attem pt against our sovereign ty
because it would be useless.”
AGRICULTURE:
Trouble Ahead
This spring the bureau o f agricu ltural
econom ics forecast a July 1
w heat supply of 1,018,900,000 bushels,
only 2,100,000 bushels short of
the figure w here fa rm ers must vote
on a creage quotas for next year.
D ry w eather in spring wheatlands
cut crop prospects, how ever, and by
m id-M ay Secretary of A gricu ltu re
H en ry A. W allace was able to avoid
an em barrassing election-year acreage
referendum by cutting the July
1 estim ate to only 974,000.000 bushels.
A further help: In 1940 fa rm ers
can plant 62,000,000 acres to
wheat, 7,000,000 m ore than this year.
A w eek a fter this announcement,
how ever, it appeared the adm inistration’s
farm program is bound for
another bogging down, another year
like m iserable 1934 and 1936. C arefu
lly checking w eather bureau reports,
Mr. W a llace found ea rly M a y
rain fall in the wheat belt w as fa r
below norm al, with drouth spreading
fast and dam age to spring crops
already heavy. Percen tages o f norm
al rainfall thus fa r: South D akota.
36; North Dakota, 45; N eb raska,
59; Kansas, 74; Montana, 55.
Though on the a verage fa r better
than 1934, conditions w ere bad
enough to m ake M r. W allace name
a drouth com m ittee who w ill aid
fa rm ers if the w orst comes.
NATIONAL
AFFAIRS
R t v i t w t d by
CARTER FIELD
It is generally accepted in
Washington that James A.
Farley is out for the Democratic
nomination for himself
. . . Factors that lead to the
popular underestimation of
the importance of his candidacy
. . . Drive for the investigation
of t h e assassination of
Senator H u e y Long brings
out a mass of contradictory
and a fete circumstantial
stories that are being circulated
in Louisiana and in
Washington.
T re n d

oven dried to crispness.
W A S H IN G T O N — Anyone who discounts
M r. Jam es A. F a rle y in picking
the next D em ocratic nominee
fo r the presidency is leavin g out a
v e r y im portant factor indeed.
B ig Jim is out for the nomination
him self. It is en tirely within the
realm of possibility
that he m ay get it,
the experience o f
the party in nominating
A lfre d E.
Sm i*k to ,he con~
■m trary notwithstanding.
But an elem ent
of this situation
which has not received
the attention
it deserves is that of
all the men who
have been m entioned
for the nomination, including
Presiden t R oosevelt him self, there
is no one who w ill have m ore influence
in controlling w here his delegates
go, if and when they lea ve
him , than Jim F a rle y.
Politicians of course are human.
T h ey are pretty much like e v e r y body
else. They look out fo r N o. 1
first, and the double cross is no
m ore a rarity in politics than it is
in business, on the stage, or w h ere
v er else human interests run into
conflict.
But there is one featu re o f politics
which is just a little different.
In the nature of things there cannot
be binding w ritten contracts in politics.
Th ere is no m eans of m aking a
livelihood where so much reliance
has to be placed on prom ises— and
on verb a l prom ises, fo r the shrewd
politician does not put into w ritin g
the sort o f prom ises that are im portant
here.
Farley Hat Reputation
For Keeping His Promises
I t so happens that besides a genius
for organization, as he proved
when he lined up the delegates for
R oosevelt in 1932, Jim F a r le y has
an enviable reputation fo r keeping
his promises. Som etim es he has
been prevented from d eliverin g—by
White House intervention— but there
h ave been no reports of any im portant
political leader thinking that
j Jim double-crossed him.
| When F arley could not d e live r it
was always a g la rin g case of the
White House refusing to com e
across. It was n ever another friend
o f F a rle y who got the job.
M eanwhile, in the seven years
that have passed, F a rle y has kept
up his contacts. H e has not fo rg otten
any po!itician's first nam e, nor
his problems, nor his friends, and,
perhaps more im portant than all,
his enemies. N o one catches F a r le
y handing out pie to som e chap
who happens to be the bitter opponent
of anyone who has been going
down the line fo r F a rle y .
It m ay be rem em bered that F a r le
y did not sym pathize with the
purge, except perhaps in the one
case o f Sen. M illard E. Tydings, and
that he took no part in it w hatever.
It was the Brain Trusters, the C orcorans
and Cohens and Hopkinses,
who stumped their toes in Iow a, in
V irgin ia, in G eorgia and South C arolina.
Th ere m ay be something that F a rley
has done to irrita te the regu lar
organization leaders in som e state,
but reports about it have not
reached Washington. And never forget
that in virtu ally e v e ry one o f the
states it w ill be the regu lar organ ization
leaders, p rim a ry or no prim
ary, who w ill pick the delegates,
and who w ill be the leaders o f their
state delegations at the convention.
Importance of Farley't
Candidacy Underestimated
Popular underestim ation o f the
im portance of Jam es A. F a rle y 's
candidacy is due to two fa ctors:
1. B elief that the defeat o f A lfred
E. Smith in 1928 proved that no
Catholic can be elected President o f
the United States.
2. Lack of appreciation o f F a r le y ’s
political shrewdness and dem onstrated
loyalty to his friends, and
the dividends these two assets m ight
pay.
A s to the first, argum ent is futile.
Nobody knows. It m ight be pointed
out in passing, h ow ever, that Al
Smith was weighed down by other
elem ents than the prejudice which
existed against his church in gaining
a foothold in the White House.
F or one thing 1928 m arked the
high tide of prohibition. U p to that
tim e the argum ent that prohibition
w as largely responsible for the e x traordinary
prosperity which ex isted
in this country under C oolidge
had not been dissipated .b y its collapse
under H oover. A t' that tim e
also most people in this country assumed
that prohibition w as here to
stay, that all agitation ^bout it was
futile, and that the thing to do was
to try to g et along under it.
A l Smith w as also ta rred with the
Tam m an y brush, and fe w N e #
Y o rk e rs w ill e v e r rea lize just how
w icked and corrupt m ost o f the folks
out in the country thought the “ T ig
e r ” was.
H oover had a p erfect a rm y o f alm
ost fanatical adm irers, scattered
in e v e ry state in the
Union. Business men
thought he could e x pand
the Coolidge
prosperity, fo r which
they alread y g a v e
him some cred it because
he had been
secreta ry o f com m
erce during it. Engineers
thrilled at
the idea o f one o f
their num ber occupying
the White
House, and thought
he would produce such efficien cy in
governm ent as had n ever been seen
before.
F o r these and other reasons the
cards w ere stacked against Smith.
Perhaps he would have been beaten
anyhow, just because o f the r e ligious
issue.
Southern Hoovercrats
Forgotten Men of Politics
But those who led the H oovercra ts
in the South are the forgotten m en
o f politics. Th ere is not one o f them
in im portant political place today
save Frank R. M cN inch. and he
flourishes not because he bolted
Smith, but because he a grees with
R oosevelt and m ost o f the liberals
on the public pow er issue.
Th is is im portant now, in v ie w o f
F a r le y ’s candidacy, because e v e r y one
in the South knows all about it.
N o one is going to take the place
played by Bishop Cannon in 1928,
even if Northern suckers hoping fo r
cabinet jobs and diplom atic posts
could be found again to finance such
a m ovem ent. N o H orace Mann is
g oing to play the “ m an o f m y stery ”
in another presidential cam paign.
N ot until an en tirely new crop of
Southern politicians is reared, a generation
which does not rem em b er
what happened to the m en who
“ won the w a r and lost the peace
tre a ty ” under H oover.
I f F a rle y should be nom inated for
P residen t he w ill have to be beaten,
if he is beaten at all, in the North
and West.
T h e significance o f this is that the
Southern leaders w ill not be as
much disturbed as they w ere in 1932
by fe a r o f a repetition o f 1928. F ea r
o f A l Smith drove them to R oosevelt
in 1932, at the convention. Th ey
m a y p refer various other candidates
to F a rle y , but there w ill be no stam pede
to any candidate based on fear
o f the consequences o f F a rle y 's
nomination.
Start Drive for Inquiry
Into Murder of Huey Long
A pparently a drive has been started
fo r an investigation o f the assassination
o f Sen. Huey P . Long. It
m a y not m aterialize, but if it does
it certainly w ill spoil a lot o f stories
which are now being told in Louisiana—
and Washington.
The w riter spent two days in N ew
O rleans recently, and listened to
quite a fe w circum stantial stories of
the killing of the Kingflsh.
Som e o f the curious conflicts in
stories told with the utmost positiveness
are:
Th at the bullet fired by Dr. Weiss
n ever struck Huey at all, the gun
being knocked up by Huey him self
just before Weiss could pull the trig ger.
That Huey was actually killed
by a bullet fired by one o f his body
guards.
A gainst this the w rite r w as told
just as positively that Dr. Weiss
held his gun within a fe w inches of
H u ey’s chest, and that Huey
knocked it downward. And that
there was no other wound save that
caused by W eiss’ bullet.
T h at the bullet which killed Huey
w as extracted by the surgeon who
operated, and that it w as a .44.
Th at the bullet which resulted in
death passed through the senator
and w as never found.
T h at the bullet in question w as a
.32— thc caliber of the pistol Dr.
W eiss used.
Conflicting Stories About
Dr. Weiss, Alleged Assassin
T h at Dr. W eiss w as alm ost decapitated
by the rain of bullets
poured into him, and died instantly.
T h at Dr. Weiss lived fo r five m inutes
after the shooting stopped,
m ost of the wounds being in his
arm s and legs.
T h at the pistol o f Dr. W eiss was
a cheap make.
Th at the pistol of Dr. W eiss was
a modern, an expensive Browning.
T h at Dr. Weiss obtained the gun
because he decided to kill Huey.
Th at Dr. Weiss a lw ays ca rried a
gun. usually leavin g it in his autom
obile.
Th at if Huey had been operated on
righ t aw ay he would not have died.
Th at he was suffering chiefly
from shock, and hence the operation
should not have been perform ed
right away.
That he was suffering from loss
o f blood, and the delay w as responsible
fo r his death.
Th at it was by the K in gflsh's im patient
command that the doctor operated,
instead o f w aiting for his
own surgeons, supposed to be enroute.
Just what good an investigation
would do is questionable.

C H A P T E R II
On the flat crest of Kenesaw Hill,
backed against the woods and looking
down an open slope toward the
m arshes and the rive r, there w ere
three houses, dissim ilar and yet
alike. D issim ilar in their outward
aspect, y et alike in that to the m ost
casual passer-by it must have
seem ed that fe a r dw elt in them all,
and secrecy, and other things besides.
H ea vy shutters w ere at e v ery
window, even though those shutters
w ere not a lw ays closed; heavy
hangings behind the lace curtains
next the glass; closed doors, chim neys
that seldom w ore a friendly
plum e o f smoke, a lawn never sufficiently
clipped and tended, and
lackin g am elioratin g shrubs or
flowers.
One o f these houses was a square
box alm ost ex actly as high as it
w as w ide, of dull brown brick, with
a dull slate roof that was so flat
it threatened to crack under the
w in ter’s w eight o f snow: a square
box o f a brick house, with a w ing
like the tail of a dog that is sitting
down, extending fo r a short distance
behind. G rass g rew tall in the fishbone
pattern o f the brick w alk that
led from the road to the front door.
And one of these houses w as a
spraw ling thing o f wood, painted
that fru gal brown which thrifty N ew
England folk so often and so unfortunately
prefer. Y e t w hoever
first designed this wooden house
must have groped toward beauty,
even toward the pleasant w ays o f
liv in g ; because there w ere broad
verandas, there w ere peaks and v a lleys
in the roof. T h ere w ere even
a few rem aining traces o f an ornam
ental border still discernible und
er the overhang at the gable ends.
The third house w as of stone. This
w as the sm allest o f the th ree; and
its height was grea te r than either its
front or breadth. It had alm ost the
appearance of a tow er o f stone;
and the stone-work extended upw
ard to the window-sills o f the second
floor. A b ove that there was
stucco; and above the stucco and
the low attic windows, there w as a
steep-pitched roof from which the
snow would slide o f itself. But this
house, even though it was the sm a llest
o f the three, w as distinguished
by one circum stance. T h ere w as
behind the house a portable sa ra g e
o f sheet m etal; and from this g a r
a g e a drive led around one side
o f the house, m aking a sharp angle
at the rea r corn er to pass between
the house and a tall pine tree there,
m aking another angle so as to pass
the front steps, and thus to the road.
And the gara ge g a v e eviden ce of
being used; the d rive w as fr e e of
grass, and there w ere some oil-spots
by the kitchen door as though a car
often stopped there.
You m ight have thought these
houses, from their aspect, em pty,
abandoned; y e t people lived in
them , and by an unchanging routine.
Each Saturday night, as a
part of this routine, they all fo rgathered
in the sitting-room o f the
big fra m e house between the other
two, w here old Denman Hurder
lived with his w ife who had been
E lla Kenesaw , and with his daughter
K itty Lea ford , and her daughter
June.
June L ea fo rd som etim es wondered
w hether other people existed as m onotonously
as these folk she knew
best: her mother, and G randpa and
G randm a H u rder; old Matthew
Bowdon and his w ife next door in
one direction; Aunt E v ie Taine, and
Uncle Justus, and Rab and Asa in
the other. This was the only w orld
she knew; a world a m ile square,
with the three houses as the focus.
And these w ere the only folk she
knew— these kinfolk and one other,
the man who lived in the cabin by
the pond which was hidden in the
sunlit woods behind the house, and
who liked to have her call him Uncle
Jim .
She had flrst m et this m an one
day a good m any yea rs ago. As
she g rew from babyhood to childhood,
Grandpa Hurder used to take
her for long walks about this m ilesquare
tract o f land that was the
K enesaw dom ain; and later, when
she was old enough to adventure
^>road alone, she explored in all
directions. She liked to slip down
tow ard the rive r, m oving secretly
am ong the young growth which was
recapturing the old pasture there;
and she discovered a screened knoll
above the stream where she could
sit unseen and watch the brighthued
canoes slip softly by.
At other tim es she went to room
fearlessly in the woods behind the
house. H a lf a m ile below the crest
of Kenesaw H ill, the woods ended at
• broad highw ay along which ca r;
passed all day long in a w eaving
pattern to and fro. She knew the
spring-fed pond deep in the woods,
and som etim es she took off her
shoes and stockings to w ade in the
clear w ater there; or she would sit
ve ry still on the rocky summit of
the knoll above the pond to watch
through the intervening branches of
the trees the cars go by.
Uncle Jim found her there one
day. She was at the tim e about ten
years old. He spoke to her, sm ilingly,
and asked her n am e; and she
told him what It was, and watched
with interest how the blood drained
out o f his lips. L a te r she saw him
m ore than once again, and one day
she told her m other o f these encounters.
K itty Lea fo rd w as a soft, querulous
woman, who lived resentfully
but not rebelliously, com plaining
without struggle. She heard June's
report in an unaccustomed silence,
and without com m ent; but she must
have reported the m atter to Aunt
E vie, because la ter Aunt E v ie told
June, in her soft, im placable tones,
not to walk in the woods again for
a while, and she bade the g irl forget
this man she had seen.
K itty L ea fo rd herself would have
subm itted— though rebelliously— to
this prohibition; but June w as of a
M r. and Mrs. Bowdon w ere
playing anagram s at another
table.
stronger fiber than her mother. She
disobeyed Aunt E v ie once, and m et
Uncle Jim and told him what had
happened. H e cam e to the house
that afternoon June saw him m eet
Aunt E vie. She did not hear what
passed between them ; but a fter that
Uncle Jim built a cabin on the
rocky knoll above the pond, and
dw elt there som etim es for weeks on
end; and June often went that w ay.
These hours when a fter her lessons
under Aunt E v ie ’s tutelage
w ere done June could slip a w ay to
the rive r, or to see Uncle Jim , m ade
life endurable fo r the child. A s she
grew into a young woman, they
w ere a part o f the routine o f her
days. H er days all w ere routine;
just as it was a part o f the routine
which held them all, that e v e ry Saturday
night a fter supper they cam e
together in the big sitting-room in
the Hurder house. Th ey did not
m eet for supper, because that m eant
ex tra w ork and even a certain additional
expense. But a fter supper
they all m et and w ere determ inedly
fe s t iv e .
“ It is a duty w e owe the child
re n ," Aunt E v ie used to say. " T o
make home pleasant and attractive
for them in w hatever w ays we
can.”
June and Rab and Asa w ere the
children. When June was eighteen,
Rab w as twenty-six, and Asa seven
yea rs old er; children no longer. But
the routine bound them still . . .
When this particular evening began—
though June would rem em ber
its e v ery detail all her life— there
was nothing to m ake it seem any
different from others that had gone
before. The day had been w arm
and sullen, and there was prom ise
o f a thunder-shower to relie ve the
heat; but K itty Lea fo rd hated thunder-
showers, so that June did not
w elcom e the prospect of this relief.
She was alw ays apt to suffer when
her m other did.
Th e g irl did the supper dishes tonight
as her regu lar duty w as; and
while she was thus engaged, Uncle
Justus and Aunt E v ie cam e in
through the kitchen from their house
next door. T h ere w as a half-bottle
of milk on the table, and Uncle Justus,
as he passed w here it stood,
knocked it off with his elbow , so
that it spilled across the floor. June
had to mop it up, while Aunt E v ie
thutst Uncle Justus on toward the
sitting-room. She did not scold him,
because she a lw ays spoke in low,
gentle tones; and Uncle Justus was
stone d ea f and n ever heard anything
she said. June som etim es thought
his deafness w as an arm or that
served him w ell.
A ftr* she had finished her tasks.
she went upstairs to her bare, highceiled
room to wash her hands and
smooth her hair, and when she reluctantly
cam e down again, the others
w ere alread y gathered in the
sitting-room . Uncle Justus sat in
the shabby old ch air by the piano
reading his paper. He would go
presently to sleep, his chin on his
chest, his glasses on his nose, his
paper on his knees.
June's m other and young Rab
T aine and A sa w ere playing threehanded
contract bridge at a cardtable
at one side. Rab had a friendly
eye, a light and am iable tongue.
When June now cam e to the door
and hesitated for a m om ent here,
he called to her:
“ Com e along and play with us tonight,
June. You belong with us
young fry , not with the p a tria rch s!”
Mr. and Mrs. Bowdon, Grandm a
and Grandpa Hurder, and Aunt
E v ie w ere playing anagram s at another
tab le; and a ch air w aited
there for June. June hesitated, but
Mrs. Bowdon interfered. Mrs. Bowdon—
she insisted that June call her
Grandm a, although she w as in fact
June’s great-aunt—w as a ponderous
white lump o f a wom an, w hite hair,
white cheeks, sm all tight lips. June
thought o f her as a crushing weight.
G randm a Bowdon said now to Rab,
in her slow, h eavy fashion:
“ R ab, June’s place is here with
us. June, here is you r ch air.”
June had no thought o f exercising
any choice in the m atter. She m ight
have a ch oice; but if she had, she
kept her wishes to herself. She had
found by experience that nothing
but bruised knuckles could result
from battering a stone wall. She
sat down w here she was bidden, and
she began to play with them the
g am e called anagram s.
U ncle Justus went to sleep in his.
ch air and began to snore, and Aunt
E v ie m ade him m ove inte the hall,
into the straight, heavily carved
ch air by the table there. The sound
o f his snores still reached them , but
no longer so disturbingly. That he
should thus m ove into the hall was
a usual occurrence and June scarce
noticed it at the tim e. L a te r she
would be puzzled by the fa ct that
Inspector Tope attached to it so
much im portance,as he did to ev ery
m ovem ent o f the others here this
evening.
Shortly a fter ten o ’clock, a m ild
argum ent developed. Th e discussion
went on and on, till K itty L e a ford
rose with a sudden angry m ovem
ent and said fre tfu lly :
" I must go to bed! I ’v e a headache.
T h is heat torm ents m e beyond
enduring.”
G randm a Bowdon protested:
"W h y , you can't go yet, K itty. It's
not half-past ten. W e n ever stop
till eleven .”
“ I m u st," said K itty Lea ford . " I
must get to sleep before the storm .”
Aunt E v ie Taine rem ark ed in her
calm , gentle tones:
“ O f course, K itty, you ought to go
to bed, if you fe el tired. I ’ll bring
som e m ilk up to you. I alw ays say
when I'm tired, a glass of w’arm
m ilk m akes m e fe el better than anything
else. W here is it, in the icech
est?”
June confessed: “ I'm afraid there
isn't any.” Uncle Justus had spilled
the last o f the d a y ’s supply.
But Aunt E v ie ignored her.
“ W e’ ve none o v er at our house,”
she reflected. “ Nothing but the top
m ilk that I saved fo r the coffee.
Mother, have you a n y?” Grandm a
Bowdon nodded; and Aunt E v ie
said: “ I ’ll run across and get
som e.”
“ It doesn't m atter, r e a lly ," K itty
L ea fo rd repeated. "G ood n igh t."
She went out into the hall and they
heard her speak, loudly, to Uncle
Justus. H e answered her, his voice
sounding from h alfw ay upstairs.
Aunt E v ie follow ed her. “ Justus,
where are you going?” she dem anded.
“ C om e h e re !” He must have
obeyed her, for when June reached
the door, he w as just sitting down
in the hall ch air again. Aunt E v ie
told her: " I ’ ll bring the m ilk right
away, June. F rom Grandma Bowdon’
s.”
She hurried aw ay, and June started
to go upstairs, to be with her
mother. Som etim es Kitty Lea ford
wanted her help in preparing for
the night; for there was a considerable
ritual involved in this procedure.
But R ab Taine called her.
"J u n e,” he urged cheerfully,
“ com e back here. It s not bed-time
yet. Stay a w h ile.”
She stood uncertainly in the doorw
ay, a tall, dark-haired girl, slender
and strong, but clad in a shapeless
and unbecoming gown.
“ Vou know,” R ab told her sm ilingly,
crossing to speak to her in a
low er tone, “ you need to learn to
play, June. Th is tomb is no place
for you. It's tim e you w ere m eeting
some young fe llo w s.”
June nodded.
" I ’m not going to stay here alw
ays,” she told him. " I 'm going
aw ay som e day. Mother has prom ised
m e.”
“ Any tim e you want to step o u t,"
R ab invited, chuckling, “ I ’ll g iv e
you a hand. I like you, June. And
I can show you around."
Asa passed them on his w ay to
the kitchen. “ Glass of w ater,” he
said, by w a y of explanation. June
heard Aunt E v ie com e in to the
kitchen, from out of doors, heard
them talking together there.
The g irl w ent along the hall to
join them, to see if she could be of
help. Aunt E v ie had poured a little
m ilk out o f a bottle into a stew-pan
and set it on the gas-stove. The
bottle was em p ty. Asa was standing
by the stove, a glass of w ater in
his hand, w hile Aunt E vie looked for
m atches. But she did not readily
find any; and June confessed:
“ I think they’ re all gone. We
m eant to order som e.”
“ I ’ll get some from Justus," Aunt
E v ie decided. She went into the hall
to rouse U ncle Justus, and June
picked up the pan of m ilk.
"M o th er has a gas-plate in her
bathroom ," she told Asa. “ I can
w arm it th ere."
He nodded without speaking. Asa
was alw ays a dour, silent man. He
went ahead o f her through the hall
and back to the sitting-room , and
June follow ed him as fa r as thc
hall. U ncle Justus w as awake, fumbling
in his pockets fo r the matches
Aunt E v ie dem anded; and June set
the m ilk down on the table beside
him.
" I ’ll w arm it upstairs.” she told
Aunt E v ie, and went into the sitting
room to say good night to Grandpa
and Grandm a Ilurder. R ab cam e
out with her, when this duty was
done, and picked up the m ilk.
“ I ’ll c a rry this u pstairs," Rab
told June, sm iling. “ I want to say
good night to Aunt K itty. Besides,
it’s too much of a load for y o u !”
H is eyes w ere tw inkling.
June was not particularly attentiv
e ; y e t later, under Inspector
T o p e's gentle inquiries, she would
rem em b er and relate e v e ry detail
o f this evening. That stew-pan with
a little m ilk in the bottom w as to
assume a dark and dreadful significance
in her eyes.
But just now, she follow ed Rab
upstairs. H e knocked on her m othe
r ’s door, and June w as at his e lbow.
“ I t ’s R a b ," he called. "June
and I have com e to tuck you in.”
K itty bade them enter. She was
in her dressing-gown, brushing her
hair. H er hair wos a flaxen yellow .
June thought it looked younger than
her m other’s face looked; but she
knew why this was so. Th ese two,

JUST as radio gave a break
to many old-time vaudev

to offer new opportunities
to theatrical and motion picture
perform ers whose fortunes

French A rcheologists at W o rk U pon
A le sia Battlefield Find Rom an Coins
Th irty-seven Rom an coins, also
179 d iverse objects which m ight
have belonged to Julius C aesar, all
o f them dating back to the Roman
occupation of Gaul, have been dug
up by a group of French archeologists
at w ork upon the historic battlefield
o f Alesia, 40 m iles from
Dijon.
F o r three decades excavations at
A lesia h a ve been ca rried on, but
during the past fe w months the
"h a r v e s t” w as so abundant that it
has inspired the archeologists,
w orking under the direction of M.
E. Esperandieu, to continue their
digging with increased vigor.
Am ong the 179 Rom an objects found
w ere locks, keys, cram p irons, needles
and fragm en ts o f p ottery; also
an elaborately decorated table in
the form of an altar and a striking
lion tn bronze (a lm o st in tact). A
“ hypocaust,” an underground fu rnace
for heating baths, w as also dug
up.
E v e r y A m erican school boy who
has plodded through C aesa r’s "C o m m
en ta rie s" is acquainted with A lesia;
it is the place w here Vercingetorix,
intrepid ch i*fta in of the
Gauls, m et his fate and was com pelled
to surrender to Caesar. A lesia
today bears the nam e o f Alise-
Sainte-Reine and, since the Middle
ages, has becom e a religiou s shrine
much frequented by Burgundians.
Saint R eine was one o f the early
Christian m artyrs in Gaul and every

is evoked in a picturesque procession.

Scientists claim redwood trees

That old adage should be rew ritten,
to read "T h e r e ’ s no rest for a
radio sta r." Vicente Gom ez, the guitarist,
is starred in the Broadway
production, "M e x ic a n a .” A fter perform
ances he rushes to the night
club where he appears—he's through
at 2 a. m. And his radio schedule
calls for appearances at nine in
the morning.

isn't like most professionals; he
doesn't keep a scrap book— because,
he rem arked recently, he's estim ated
that if he'd kept clippings from
all the newspapers in which his ca rtoons
alone have appeared, they
would require an average-sized
house. But he has a collection to
which he doesn't begrudge plenty of
room. It consists of m ore than 500
dolls which w ere gathered in 200 d ifferent
countries. He has been offered
a small fortune for the collection,
but won't sell even part of it.

A C heerful N ote p Ayres
Cleveland allayin
g fears of a bear market, in his
m onthly business survey, a periodic
voice as authoritative as any noontide
bulletin from the m inarets of
Cairo.
Colonel Ayres, vice president of
the C leveland Trust company, was
a school teacher for many years,
and is the author of a book called
“ The Measurement of Spelling A bility,”
one of about a dozen of his
books on educational subjects. He
has written a sim ilar number of
books on business and finance, and,
in his entire range, from spelling
to selling, he has never overlooked
detail and he is no offhand prophecie
r—prophecy being his main line,
as contrasted to that of m ere m arket
analysis.
He has logged eight m ajor depressions
and eight cycles of inflation
and deflation, and he gets
the feel of the thing, in about
the same w ay a good cook gets
the feel of a cook book. He was
one of the few financial experts
who saw the 1929 blizzard com ing.
and said so. On October 3,
1928, he w rote: “ The golden age
of Am erican business has come
to an end.”
Nobody was paying much attention
to the muezzin then. He kept
on repeating that the condition of
finance was “ thoroughly unhygienic,”
but the wind wasn't right and
the words didn’t carry down to the
m arket place below.
A native of Niantic, Conn.,
Colonel Ayres was educated at
’ioston university, later garlandfd
with a chaplet of honorary
degrees from other colleges. lie
taught school at Rochester, N.
Y ., and at Puerto Rico, and in
the latter engagement turned
his spare tim e to statistical research,
with such success that
he became statistician for the
A . E. F . in w ar days—hence his
title.
Previous to takuig over the
banking post in Cleveland, he
w as a director of education for
the Russell Sage foundation, and
he had rounded out his career as
an educator nicely before starting
another in finance. In between
the two work zones, he
w edged a book, “ The W ar With
G erm any,” written in 1919.

I N T H E depth of the depression, a
* group of W all Street financiers
hired an economist to draft for them
a shock-proof and slump-proof plan

Smo Business ment of their
Sagacity Seems surplus funds,
H ig hly Plausible » ° assure them
security in their
old age. A fter diligent research,
their adviser found that no such
plan was possible, but suggested as
an alternative that they put their
m oney in the keeping o f some sagacious
Chinese financier.
This w riter recalled then that several
of the shrewdest business men
in this country, including Edward
Bruce of the fine arts division of
the treasury department and the
late W illiam R. Murchison,~ had
learned about the care and nurture
o f money from the Chinese sages of
the abacus, and now comes Richard
C. Patterson Jr., also schooled in
business in China. He retires as
assistant secretary of com m erce to
take a private post.
Rack from China in 1927, with
half of his allotted span of years
still ahead of him and a sizable
fortune already in hand, he
wished to put in the rest of his
life being socially useful. He
was commissioner of corrections
o f N ew York city until 1932,
given s big hand for his effe ctiveness
on the job.
Just a year ago, he becam e a sort
o f liaison officer between the departm
ent of com m erce and the nation’s
business. In this capacity, he
urged a friendly get-together in an
“ economic clinic,” as he thinks part
o f our trouble is due to a lack of
basic facts and sound understanding
of economic and business forces.
He was s Nebraska farm boy,
routed through the U niversity of
Nebraska and the Columbia
School of Mines to a successful
professional and business ca reer,
first as a mining engineer
with the J. Ci. White Engineering
company, as a consultant for
the DuFonts and later in mining
and business ventures in China.
He served on the M exican border
and in the World w ar, a m ajor
in the latter, annexing .several
foreign decorations. ,

JUST W H A T IS
A F E W months ago, according to
that beguiling w riter, Bruce
Barton, a la rg e fa ctory caught flre.
It burned to the ground. Sirens
shrieked. C row ds m illed. F irem en
fought the flam es. N ew sp ap er reporters
scurried here and there a fter
stories. Consternation reigned.
Am id all this confusion the m ost
serene m an in sight w as the president
o f the fa ctory,
he who should have
been the m ost excited.
A ligh tin g from
his ca r, he strolled
o v er to w here that
which he had spent
yea rs in building
w as becom ing a total
loss. H e was
calm , at ease, undisturbed.
A new spaper man
spied him . asked Charles Roth
him w hy he w as no
m ore concerned. H e explained that
the loss w as fu lly covered by insurance
and that, besides, the most
valu ab le asset o f the business hadn’ t
even been touched by the fire.
‘ ‘T o w hat asset do you refer, Mr.
B u rlin g a m e? "
“ W hy, to our good w ill. W e can
build a new fa ctory—now w e’ ll have
to. W e can buy new m a c h in e r y -
better m achinery than w as in the
old plant. A s long as the good w ill
o f a business ia intact, nothing else
m atters,” he concluded.
H e was right. Th e m ost lm por-
G O O D W ILL?
tant thing a business m an haa is
the good w ill o f his custom ers. E v ery
business which has that is successfu
l; e v ery business which does
not h a ve it fails.
G ood w ill is not a m ysterious
quality like genius. It is a sim ple,
comm onsense m atter depending
upon doing sim ple, comm onsense
things.
Th e flrst o f these consists o f g iv ing
good valu e and service, that
the business m a y win and hold
friends. T h e second consists o f m aking
the fa ct that the business is the
kind which wins and holds friends
known to its custom ers, by tellin g
them o f ita ideals and its services
and its merchandise.
This telling process is called advertising.
Whenever a manufacturer
or a merchant advertises in the
newspaper he informs yon that he
is the kind of business man whom it
would pay you to patronise. He
makes public the fact that he wants
good will and that he realises the
only way he can keep It is by living
up to his promises.
Y ou as a custom er g et m ore for
your m oney when you patronize a
concern with good w ill. Good w ill
is proof that the concern has done
something to w arran t the friendship
and confidence o f its customers.
Y ou see, good w ill doesn't just
happen. It is created—by good
goods, by good service, by good advertising.

Fightin’ Irishman
p 'A R L Y in the Nineteenth century
an Irish lad named Jim m y
Shields ran aw ay from his home in
County Tyrone. The ship on which
he set out for A m erica was w recked
off the coast o f Scotland and he
was one of only three su rvivors
Undaunted by this experience, the
boy set out again An Atlantic gale
drove this ship upon a re e f off the
Carolina coast and Shields, who had
been aloft, was thrown to the deck
with both legs broken. The boat was
w recked but by an almost m iraculous
chance he was rescued by a
passing vessel.
A fter recoverin g from his injuries,
he enlisted in the arm y and fought
in the first Seminole Indian w ar in
F lorida, a fter which he headed for
the new state o f Illinois. T h ere he
m ade a livin g for a tim e by teaching
French in thc French v illa g e of
Kaskaskia!
Then he studied law, soon passed
the bar exam inations and within a
few years was su ccessively elected
representative in the legislature,
state auditor and justice o f the Illinois
Supreme court. A t the outbreak
of the M exican w ar he raised
a regim ent and fell desperately
wounded at the Battle o f C erro
Gordo.
Chosen United States senator
from Illinois he served for six years,
w as defeated for re-election and
m oved to Minnesota w here he was
again sent to the senate. At the
outbreak of the C ivil w ar he was
m ade a brigadier-gen eral and was
again desperately wounded in battle.
But he su rvived and was again
elected to the United States senate
—this tim e from Missouri. When he
died in 1879 Shields had the distinction
of being the only man in A m e rican
history who had served as senator
from three different states.

Patriot and Painter
Q E N . G E O R G E W A S H IN G T O N ,
besieging the British in Boston,
wanted accurate draw in gs o f the
en em y's positions. So a young Connecticut
Yankee volunteered to get
them . He crept close to the British
lines and m ade sketches which
pleased the com m ander so much
that he m ade the young fellow a
colonel and his second aide-de-cam p.
The young colonel next served as
adjutant-general to G en eral G ates
and in 1778 accom panied G en eral
Sullivan as a volunteer against the
British in Rhode Island. When this
expedition proved unsuccessful, he
resolved to g iv e up soldiering.
He went to London to study under
B enjam in West and soon becam e
the fa vo rite pupil o f that great
painter. When M aj. John Andre,
the British adjutant-general in
A m e rica , was caught and hanged as
a spy, the young painter seem ed to
the British the logical man to be
used for reprisal So they put him
in prison Instead o f protesting, the
truculent young Yankee boasted
that he had been an aide to that
" a r c h rebel,” G eo rge Washington,
and was proud o f it.
O nly the intervention o f his painter
friends. West and Copley, saved
him from hanging. Lu cky for
A m erica that they did! O therw ise
John Trum bull m ight never have
lived to paint such grea t historical
w orks as "T h e Battle o f Bunker
H ill,” "T h e Signing o f the D ecla ra tion
o f Independence,” and "T h e

newspaper he had established there
four years ea rlier, he w rote to his
sister, Jane Franklin M ecom : “ That
island is reckoned one of the healthiest
in the West Indies. M y late
partner there en joyed p erfect health
for four years until he g rew care-
I less and got to sitting up late in
taverns which I have cautioned Ben-
| ny a ga in st."
Presu m ably Benny follow ed his
j uncle's advice but he w as too much
of a Franklin not to be restless. He
! soon becam e dissatisfied, even
though Franklin increased his share
! of the profits, and wanted to “ go It
| on his ow n.” So Franklin sold him
■ the press which he m oved to Bosi
ton. Th ere in 1758 he issued the
j first separate edition of F rank lin’s
“ F ather A brah am 's Speech ," later
fam ous under the title of "T h e W ay
] to W ealth ."
U nfortunately Benny didn't apply
j its lessons to him self. He becam e
something o f a fop, strutting around
! in fine clothes instead of sticking
to work. F ailin g to prosper, he
m oved the press to New Y ork in
1 17G3 but had no better success there.
! Then he went to N ew H aven where
he rented a press from Postm aster

But he failed to m ake good there.

H e re ’ s a yarn that packs thrills enough to last through
a w hole night. A t least, it did for M rs. Dorothy Murphy, the
Bronx, N. Y . M any y ea rs ago, Dorothy was livin g on a fa rm in
the Chestnut R id ge section near the little town o f D over Plains,
N. Y . She set out to drive to the railroad station three m iles aw ay,
and b efo re she got back she’ d had enough adventures to last a
lifetim e.
Th at was in February, 1914. Dorothy was just 18 years old.
H er aunt had been spending two weeks with the fam ily and it
was she whom Dorothy d rove to the train on that cold February
evening. Autom obiles w eren’ t so com mon then. What Dorothy
drove was a surrey, drawn by an old, half-blind horse named
B rownie.
The train pulled out o f D over Plains at 6:45 p. m ., and D orothy
turned the horse around and headed for home. A lrea d y it
was dark— a moonless, starless night. T h e w ay back
lay along a steep, rough, unfenced country road that
clim bed for nearly three m iles before it reached Chestnut
R idge. On one side of it la y thick woods coverin g an upw
ard slope o f the ground, and on the other was a steep declivity.
F o r part of the distance, that d eclivity straightened
out into a tall cliff. And there was nothing to preven t a ca rria g e from
going o v e r it, if it approached too close to its edge.
Th at w as Dorothy's first th rill—the prospect of driving o ver that road
in the dark. She hadn’t thought darkness would fa ll so soon that night,
and she w as scared stiff o f that cliff. As she drove along, and the darkness
deepened, she couldn't see her hand before her face, and she g a v e
B rownie a fre e rein, hoping that his instincts would keep him on the road.
Dorothy F elt the Wheels Slipping O ver the E dge.
T h ey w ere going along the top of that cliff, and all w as going
w ell. And then, all of a sudden, Dorothy felt the wheels slipping
o ver the edge. Poor, half-blind old B rownie had failed ber. He

C. Houston Goudiss Offers Practical Advice
Regarding First Meal o f the Day; Some
Breakfast-Time Wisdom for Homemakers
By C. H O U S T O N G O U D IS S
I F T H E R E is one m eal that can be reg a rd ed as m ore important
than any other, that m ea l is breakfast. It com es after
the longest fast and precedes a m a jor portion o f the day’ s
work. Thirteen hours elapse between a 6:30 supper and a 7:30
breakfast, and the body engine requires a new supply o f fuel
before the daily activities are begun. Y e t a ll too frequ en tly
this first m eal is inadequate in food values, and is gobbled in
haste . . . with m n »a n n .»m . >

effect upon health.

had gone too close to the e d g e ! The surrey g a v e a sudden lurch
and Dorothy was thrown out into space!
Says Dorothy: “ I clutched at the a ir as it slid past me,
like a drowning man clutches at straws. My hands grabbed some
bushes grow ing out from the side of the cliff and I hung on for
a ll I was worth. And there I was, betw een earth and air, and
w ith nothing to save me from death on the rocks below but my precarious
hold on those shrubs.”
Dorothy says that tim e has no meaning under such circum stances.
; Th e minutes seem ed like years. H er arm s w ere aching and her head
| w as sw im m ing. She could hear Brownie and the su rrey wandering off
in the darkness. E vid en tly the old horse had pulled the surrey back on
! the road a fter she had been thrown out. F o r a terrib le m om ent she
clung to the bushes, and then her fingers encountered a branch of a sm all
tre e grow in g along the side o f the cliff.
She caught it with one hand—then the other— and drew herse
lf up over the e liff to safety. She lay on the ground for a while,
sick and weak. Then, having recovered a little, she got up and
stumbled to the road.
B row nie and the surrey w ere nowhere in sight. Dorothy started
w alking toward home. Y ou 'd think she'd had enough adventuring for
one night— but the big thrill hadn't even started. She had only w alked a
fe w steps when she heard a sound that froze her blood in her veins—the
baying and yelping o f dogs.
Wild D og Pack Pursues T errified Dorothy.
Dogs don't sound so dangerous— but Dorothy knew better. A
short tim e before she had seen the body o f a boy w ho had been
killed and partially eaten by these sam e dogs. Th ey w ere wild
anim als—descendants of dogs who had rua aw ay from their m asters
to live in the woods and had reverted to type. E v e ry once
in a while, in those days, packs of that sort appeared in the woods
ln various places throughout the country. And they still do, in
w ild, outlying regions.
A single dog would run at the sight of a man, but in a pack, and in
the m iddle o f the w in ter when they w ere half starved, they would attack
alm ost anyone. D orothy knew all too w ell w hat would happen if this
pack caught up with her. She turned, stumbling, ir.to the woods and
ran until she found a tree.
It w as a tree with a low fork of its branches—one she could climb.
She began pulling herself up into it. Th e yelping of the pack was coming
n earer and nearer. She w asn't a minute too soon. She had hardly
clam bered into the low er branches when they w ere on the spot, yelping
and snarling at the bottom of the tree.
“ And there 1 w as.” she says, "perch ed in the tre e while the
hunger-maddened brutes howled and snarled below. I still turn
flick and cold all o v er when I think of that m om ent. Th e worst
part of it was that I was afraid I'd grow w eak or faint, or so numb
from the cold that I'd fa ll out. I knew w hat would happen then.”
With the F irst Streaks o f Dawn thc Dogs Left.
Hour a fter hour Dorothy clung to that tree, w ondering w hy her folks
didn't m iss her and com e looking fo r her. W ondering w hy they didn’ t
rea lize something w as w rong when the horse and bu ggy cam e home
without her. She didn't know that old B rownie, turning com pletely
around in hia struggles to haul the surrey back on the road, had w andered
back to town and was spending the night in an open horse shed.
H er folks thought D orothy had decided to spend the night with relatives
in town, as she often did, so they didn’ t w orry. And all that night, she
crouched in the tree racked by the cold and harried by terrib le fears.
As the first streaks of gra y appeared In the sky, the dogs
dunk off through the woods, and when she thought it was safe
■he cam e down and craw led to the road. She couldn't w alk, but a
fa rm er, driving to the m ilk depot, found her in the road and
brought her home.
D orothy says she's w ritten this story for us other adventurers to
read, but she adds, "U su a lly, I don't think o f it if I can help it ."

m ea ger breakfast are licked before
the d a y ’s work
is started. Th ey
n ever seem to get
into high g ea r and
they lack the en ergy
to perform their
tasks efficiently.
H om em akers who
find them selves fa tigued
and irritable
before the m ornin
g’s w ork is com pleted
m ay be surprised
to learn that
their lassitude is due to a skim py
breakfast. And children who go
to school a fter an insufficient
m orning m eal cannot hope to
m ake good grad es in their studies.
T h ey fa tigu e quickly, find it d ifficult
to concentrate and easily becom
e cross. M oreover they are
apt to experien ce hunger pangs
during the m iddle o f the m orning;
and when It is tim e for the noon
m eal they w ill either ea t too much
or w ill have lost their appetite,
thus disrupting the entire food
program .
Starting the D ay Right
It is th erefore essential that
e v ery hom em aker recognize the
necessity for providing a substantial
and satisfying breakfast. This
is not difficult to do; nor is it nec-
' essary to spend a g rea t deal of
tim e in its preparation.
When I hear such com plaints as
" M y fa m ily won’ t ea t b reak fast”
! or " T h e y ’ re sim ply not interested
in food in the m orning,” I suspect
that the menus are dull and
monotonous; and perhaps m em bers
of the household have the bad
habit o f sleeping so la te that there
is no tim e to eat properly.
1 Both situations are ea sily rem edied.
and they are closely linked.
F o r if the breakfast menus are
m ade sufficiently a ttractive, it
w on’t be difficult to persuade
e v e r y m em b er o f the fa m ily to
rise a little ea rlier in order to
en joy a substantial, unhurried
m eal.
A M odel B reakfast

eluded in som e other m eal during
the day. But cerea l in som e form
is usually the m ainstay o f the
breakfast menu, and there are
m any kinds front which to choose
— both hot cereals and cold
cereais.
Hot or Cold C ereal
Som e people have the notion
that cereals must be hot in order
to be nourishing. This is a fa lla cy .
F o r the nu tritive value of a cerea l
is determ in ed by the grain from
which it is m ad e and by the m anufacturing
process—not by whether
it is hot or cold. It is desirable
to g iv e w hole grain cereals a
prom inent place in the diet. This
rule can be follow ed even when
cold cerea ls a re used. F o r there
are m any nourishing ready-to-eat
cereals m ade from substantially
the whole grain . These appeal to
the palate because they a re so
crisp and appetizing. And they
supply im portan t m inerals, a good
amount o f vitam in B and some
vitam in G, in addition to en ergy
values.
A Cold C ereal An alyzed
I t ’s interestin g to analyze a popular
ready-to-eat ce rea l, m ade
from w heat and m alted barley.
W e find a w'ide assortm ent o f nutrients,
including protein, en ergy
values, phosphorus fo r the teeth
and bones; iron for building rich
red blood; and vitam in B which
prom otes appetite and aids digestion.
It has been estim ated
that a servin g o f this ce re a l—
three-fourths o f a cup— with onefourth
cup o f w hole m ilk, w ill provide
an adult w ith 7 per cent of
his total d a ily requ irem ent o f protein;
11.5 p er cent of his calcium ,
11.2 per cent o f his phosphorus;
9.75 per cent o f his iron, and a
total of 125 calories.
V a ry the Method of Serving
T o help m ak e breakfast interesting,
v a r y the cerea l from day
to day. O r o ffe r a choice of se vera
l kinds o f packaged ready-toea
t cerea ls and allow each m em ber
o f the fa m ily to select the one
he prefers. V a ry the fru it also.
And occasionally you m a y com bine
fresh, canned or stew ed fruit
w'ith cerea ls to m ake a “ cerea l
sundae.” F u rth er variation m ay
be introduced by using brown
sugar or honey in place o f w hite
sugar. And on occasion the ce reals
m ay be baked into muffins,
w affles or pancakes.
It is also possible to se rve the
eg g s in m an y differen t fo rm s—
poached, baked, scram bled or in
a plain or pu ffy om elet.
I f these suggestions are fo llow

large and atrong in proportion to car weight.
The Ford car i* stabilized for comfortable

comfort — are by far the most important
essentials in any motor car. Ther form the
basic value o f your investment.
With this solid foundation to build on, the
Ford V-8 has been made beautiful, spacious,
easy to drive. It is richly upholstered and has
all the modern features which add to the luxury
