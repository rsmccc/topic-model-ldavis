HENRY R A N D A LL DIES A T 89
Announcement comes from Ashby 
Minn o f the death on August 11th 
o f Henry Randall early day school
teacher and buttermaker in Jackson
county 
In January this year The Republican
printed a lengthy sketch o f Mr 
Randall together with the portrait
below which was reproduced from a
photograph in his school teaching
days about 65 years ago Born Nov 
24 1850 he was a son o f Mr and
Mrs William Randall early settlers
at North Bend Surviving members o f
the Randall family are a sister Mrs 
Eva S Cook residing in La Crosse 
and William E Randall a brother 
o f Onalaska 
The above article is from the Galesville
Republican We are also indebted
to its publisher Bert A Gipple 
for the engraving 
HENRY RANDALL
D H Randall was an early day
teacher in the Sechlerville school and
there are a score or more o f his pupils
still living who well remember
him Some o f them are residents of
the county and others live in distant
places 
Mr Randall came to Sechlerville
in 1880 to teach the winter term 
o f school The building still stands
and is used as a dwelling though in
outward appearance it is but little
changed It ceased to be a school
house more than 40 years ago when
the Hixton graded school was established 
Rural schools a half century ago
were very different than those o f the
present When Mr Randall taught
at Sechlerville the school house was
outfitted very poorly A part o f its
foundation had been removed for
ventilating beneath it A single box
stove and generally green oak wood
furnished the heat in the long cold
winters and as his own janitor Mr 
Randall kept busy on the below zero
days stuffing the old stove with wood 
as the pupils forced from their seats
by the cold encircled it to keep as
warm as the circumstances would
permit Seldom were all the windows
intact throughout the winter and
paper patched panes were common 
The lumber in the ceiling had dried
out so as to leave numerous open
spaces between the boards Storm
windows were unknown in that period 
The furniture was hand made o f
pine lumber and the seats and desks
were all cut and carved by the many

boys who received their start in education
in the echool The blackboards
were o f pine boards once
painted black enough but the paint
had worn thin in many spots by the
constant marking and erasing with
sheepskin eraser Note books were
yet to come and every pupil was provided
with a noisy slate and slate pencil 
These slates were also handy for
use as weapons when the younger
pupils wagen war upon one another 
It was not a small school in Mr 
Randall s day as teacher The seating
capacity was sufficient for about
40 but the enrollment in winter
months often was 60 or more A
few wooden benches helped care for
the over flow 
The pupils ranged in all the ages
from 5 to 25 years The attendance
was regular except upon the rawest
winter days when drifted roads prevented
some o f the younger folks
from getting through Probably half
the pupils came from the village and
the other half from the surrounding
farms Numerous pupils walked a
mile or more each way no matter
what the weather and but few were
as warmly clad as people are in these
times Very few o f the boys wore
over coats and overshoes and rubbers
were commonly supposed to be
for men folks only and not many
men or women used them 
In the winter months there were
always several young men and women
over school age who obliged to
work in the summer months sought
their only educational opportunity in
continuing to attend the winter sessions 
The studies were not graded 
and the same branches were taken
over and over again to obtain the
thoroughness which marked success 
Particular attention was given to
penmanship by most pupils but paper
was scarce and expensive pens were
few and poor and often the ink was
made at home by mixing indigo bluing
and water Foolscap paper
cost 1 cent per sheet The modern
scratch pad had not been devised 
With all the drawbacks Mr Randayy
conducted an interesting school 
and he was popular with pupils and
their parents alike He remained as
the teacher at Sechlerville several
years working at odd jobs during the
vacation period Then when the Silver
Mound Creamery was established
there he concluded to learn that business 
He served his apprenticeship 
and soon afterward became the buttermaker
in the same creamery 
The Silver Mound Creamery was
destroyed by fire after being in operation
a few years and some time
elapsed before another was built on
the same foundation During that interim 
Mr Randall found a position
in a creamery in Minnesota and he
and his family moved there Some
thirty years ago he returned to Wisconsin
to operate a creamery for the
late H A Bright at Longwood a few
months He then returned to Minnesota
where he continued his creamery
employment until he retired 
Mr Randall was married to Miss
Emma Kennedy also a native o f the
North Bend community in 1872 A
son and a daughter were born to
them Mrs Randall was also highly
regarded by Sechlerville people She
had an active part in church and temperance
work and was one o f the organizers
o f the first Sechlerville
lodge o f Good Templars She preceded
him in death His funeral was
conducted on Sunday August 13th 
and the remains were interred beside
those o f his wife at Marshall Minnesota

in the intervening years and
during a decade or two he has been

Carleton D Babcock ar old time
Middle West and West coast newspaper
man has purchased a substantial
interest in the San Bruno (California)
Union a weekly newspaper

to the state capital to take a
position as corporation clerk in the

the next two years he wrote and
maneuvred through the legislature 
the Oregon Blue Sky law and other
corporation legislation and spent his
evenings at Willamette university law
school from which he was graduated
with an L L B degree and later admitted
to the bar 
Before leaving the service o f the
state he spent a year and a half as
a member o f the industrial accident

His political experience was followed
by more newspaper work on a
local weekly and by a few months 
service with the Republican state central
committee as head o f the publicity
department

In all these activities he kept up
his newspaper contacts and established
several house organs For several
years after returning to the coast
he was engaged in legal political public
relations work and association activities 
but for the past 10 or 12
years he has been occupied principally
with various phases o f publication
work He has edited several trade
publications and has done some free

OLD TIM ERS M ARK BACK TO
L A CROSSE A T COUNTY FAIR
(From Galesville Republican)
The action o f La Crosse in extending
the Inter State Fair over
Sunday and making it a free fair to
compete with the Trempealeau and
Buffalo county fairs was not surprising
to old fair men here and particularly
to J A Kellman for many
years treasurer o f the county agricultural
society and chief ticket seller 
Mr Kellman recalls the days o f
railway excursion trains When a
special train pulled in from Winona 
the excursionists would detrain on the
sidetrack get in line behind their
band and headed by John Latsch or
George Hirsch march to the fairgrounds 
Arriving the line would be
held and every last one o f the 200
or more would buy a ticket and
march through the gate in a body 
Courtesies were extended the band 
When a La Crosse delegation came 
if a band or a ball team accompanied 
Mr Kellman says it was amazing
the size o f the band and ball team 
Others in line would get hold o f bats 
mask and other paraphernalia and try
to crash the gate It was the same
with trying to work band extra
equipment If a La Crosse horse was
entered in a race it seemed that
about 50 or more owned an interest
in that horse and expected free tickets
to gate and grandstand 
 Of course said Mr Kellman 
 such fellows as Mike Kratchwil Joe
Miller Joe Funk Doc Gatterdam 
Frank Toland John Elliott Louie
Hirschheimer George Hodge Henry
Reget George Rose Frank Toland 
Jule Freas Bill Cameron and others
I recall o f that generation were not
o f this ilk There was nothing cheap
about them and they had a keen appreciation
o f the value o f being good
neighbors 
The old age horizon has been made
falsely bright o f late b y sparkling
 pension plans which make the fu ture
glow like an Aurora Borealis
display 
B ut how m any o f these plans will ever
get dow n to earth to benefit you   One
thing seems certain H ard working citizens
would never approve any scheme
that would force them to carry on their
necks all persons who reach a specified
birthday There would be too m any undeserving
in with the deserving 
W ith so m uch theory in the air a
growing bank account during productive
years still seems to offer the best pension
plan for the average man or woman

L IT T E R OF PIGS W EIGH IN G TON
Congratulations are in order for
Thorwald Fristad o f Fairchild and a
member o f the Evergreen Valley 4 H
club whose knowledge o f pig raising
recently netted him a neat profit 
On February 18 a litter o f 12 pigs
was born on the Fristad farm This
is unusual in view o f the fact that
most litters of pigs run around seven
or eight Through a knowledge o f
how to feed this litter a balanced
diet including meat scraps and corn 
Fristad brought their total weight to
2450 pounds and sold them August
17 to the Drummond Packing Co 
Eau Claire for about $6 per 100
pounds 
Though a ton litter is exceptional 
authorities agree that the whole success
o f such an enterprise lies in the
proper feeding and care o f the pigs
and that equally surprising results
can be obtained in the raising o f
smaller litters Eau Claire Leader

ball game with the Merchants As
a special added attraction Miss Helen
Stephens world famous Olympic

landscape and will vie with Teeples
in a race around the bags Other exhibits
in the young lady s program include
slinging an 8 pound shot about 
sending the discus for a ride and doing
a special sprint These added
features give local people a chance
to see the same performances which
were viewed by tens o f thousands of
Olympic fans in Germany in the
Olympic games o f 1936 The girl will
put on her show before the regular
game so those who wish to see the
best woman athlete in the business
are advised that the performance will
take place before the game 
The fellers with overabundance o f
chin tapestry who will tangle with
the Merchants in the hosshide art 
originally came from Benton Harbor 
Michigan and for years have thrilled
baseball bugs with their comic

P1NEY WOODS CUBS RAINED
OFF SCHEDULE
The Piney Woods Brown Cubs who
have been scheduled here for appearances
on two occasions have been
stopped by rain on both o f their
dates with the Merchants having
been the victim o f a miniature cloudburst
last Sunday night And aside
from the financial angle o f the game 
weren t any too put out on account o f
the descending torrent A game
scheduled with the P N A o f Winona
was cancelled so there was no
game here on Thursday evening
either 
There being no ball games to clutter
up the news space we take an opportunity
to give a resume o f what
the Black River men have done in the
records by slapping a bunch o f figures
at the folks for their perusal
and consideration Among the hitters
there are at present three who are
in the select 300 circle Leading the
list is Ernie Rudolph who beside his
great work on the hill is still one o f
the ablest swatsmen ever to grow up
in these parts His percentage for the
season is 348 Next is the other
Rudolph spring off baptized Arthur 
and later dubbed the Slugger Art s
percentage for the season is 333 a
swell figure alright but even more
commendable is the guy s run battedin
record for the season The husky
second sacker has 27 hits with which
he has smacked 26 runs over the pay
spot and that folks is what is known
as hitting in the clutch Hauser is
the third clouter with a neat 314 average 
But glance over the record below

Other figures show that the Merchantes
as a team have scored 102
runs to their opponents 29 have 176
hits to their foe s 120 have coaxed 61
passes to 18 dished out to the enemy 
have struck out only 148 times as
compared with 252 for the opposition
and have stolen 28 bases to 9 burglaries
by the other side In pitching
Rudolph has won 12 games and lost
only three two o f the losses being
by a single run and the other game
being a loss to the Ethiopian Clowns
by 5 to 1 Rudolph has allowed only
17 earned runs in 17 games an average
o f exactly one per game He
has given up 94 hits but struck out
224 batters so when an opponent
steps to the plate his chances o f
striking out are about two and onehalf
times greater than his chance to
hit Ernie has walked 14 in 17 games

their many radio programs over both the Red adn Blue Networks o f the National

octette as well belying the old adage of show business that good looks and
voices do not usually go hand in hand

MERLIN HULL S LETTE R
There will be no lack o f partisanship
in the discussion o f government
problems in the next 14 months 
There s a campaign ahead A summary
o f the votes cast on fifty or
more f the oustanding measures before
Congress might show a strange
mixture o f party votes Probably
on not more than a score o f such
measures were there strict party
votes cast and on a still fewer number
o f bills were there no strays
from either o f the major parties on
various roll calls There is a lot o f
independent voting in both houses 
But as the campaign becomes hotter
in the next few months there will be
many instances mentioned when
some will be blamed for what happened
or what didn t happen when
the members o f one party or the
other strayed from their party fold 
That has always been the case probably
always will be the case 
There is another angle to the
matter of blaming members which
might receive a bit more attention 
but does not And that is the effect
o f absentees upon the result o f rollcalls 
At every session where the
success or defeat o f measures is decided
by a narrow margin the result
may be due to absent members 
It is not always possible to arrange
pairs for absentees even though a
thorough system has been established
in both houses for that very purpose 
Members are not always to be blamed
for being absent Among 531 members 
there are always some lying ill
in hospitals or who are called away
for good reasons In the month of
March there were 52 members of
the House in the hospitals and several
senators laid up by illness 
Toward the close o f each session 
the number absent increases greatly 
Some get tired o f the grind and go
home Others plan trips at home or
abroad and congress remains longer
than they anticipated Some go out
upon committee business As many
important bills come up in the closing
days o f the recent session some
20 senators and twice as many representatives
had left Washington 
Some were on their way to Europe
and others had arrived there Most
o f them had left pairs behind but
general pairs do not always work
out as the members intend Whether
there would have been any great difference
in results cannot be known 
but when a change o f 10 or 12 votes
would bring different results nobody
can say what would have been
the case had all members been present
and voting 
The Department o f State has
made rather a startling move which
undoubtedly would rave aroused
much debate had it occurred before
congress adjourned It has arranged
a loan o f about $13 000 000 to Dictator
Franco in Spain Franco is
busy pacifying Spain by killing o ff
his opposition leaders and apparently
needs funds to rehabilitate his
war torn country Conditions are
likely to remain chaotic there for
years to come By working our neutrality
law for the first and only
time it was applied our country kept
clear of the Spanish conflict As a
credit risk that country is far poorer
than a tenant farmer in the dust
bowl For some reason the State department
is willing to risk a few more
millions in loans to that section of
the world where many millions have
gone and none returned 
That department is also lending
some sympathy to the peoples movement
to boycott goods imported from
Japan That boycott has reached considerably
proportions The big department
stores have made many
millions in the importation and sale
o f Japanese wares some o f which
are cheaply made imitations o f our
own industrial products They now
find it necessary to keep out o f the
bargain sales o f such goods and
some stores no longer handle them 
But the Japanese manufacturers are
trying to turn a new trick by stamping
their wares as Made in China 
and their goods now are coming in
and are being sold under that label 
a fraudulent procedure which should
result in prompt prosecution It is
through its exports that Japan is
able to obtain the foreign exchange
to carry on its war on China and
incidentally to bomb American missions
and hospitals in that country 
There is no question that congress
would have taken a strong stand upon
an embargo on trade with Japan
had it been permitted to do so 
It was prevented only by the power
o f the organization to keep such
measures from being brought up For
a time action seemed imminent in
the Senate where the Pittman
amendment was pending That action
was forestalled when the State department
suddenly served notice of
its intention to revoke the trade
treaty with Japa n in January thus
succeeding in portponing action by
the Senate Japan obtains 80 per
cent o f all its war materials from
our country and Great Britain and
France which countries take more
than 80 per cent o f its exports But
for such imports and exports Japan
would get out o f China in three
months When congress meets in January 
the Japanese issue will be to
the front The people o f America
will no longer stand the blame for
sharing in the aggression o f an outlaw
nation 
The Department o f Commerce issues
an encouraging statement that
the retail business o f the counry has
increased over a billion dollars above
that o f the first six months o f 1938 
In part the increase comes from the
expansion o f home building under the
government financing system and to
some more limited extent by government
purchases It lends some cheer
to the situation however 
Incidentally a little part o f this
increase comes from a source not so
encouraging to farmers who will have
pork to sell on falling markets Importations
o f pork from Poland are
increasing under the reciprocal trade
treaties with that county Last year 
Poland shipped us pork at the import
value o f $11 756 298 Importations
this year exceed that monthly
average by nearly 50 per cent In
April the shipments came to $1 
INHERITS $100 000

262 904 Import values are based on
the cost o f the pork in Poland and
not upon retail prices here That
same pork from Poland is sold to
our big city consumers at more than
twice the import value Our own
country will have 27 000 000 hogs to
sell this year Nobody would allege
that the falling prices in our own
markets are due to the imported product 
but certainly the importations
do not serve to increase the value of
our own hog crop 
Imports o f beef cattle and canned
meat also are increasing over those
of last year Canada and Mexico are
expected to unload 700 000 head on
our markets In the month o f April 
there were a larger number o f cattle
brought in from Canada than
there were sold o f our own cattle in
the Chicago market the largest stock
market in our country Figures showing
a general increase o f the retail
trade are interesting and so would
be figures showing a falling o ff in
the foreign competition with our
farm products at a time when the
prices o f such products are on the
toboggan slide

ELEVEN IS UNLUCKY
Pushing the traditional 13 out o f
the accident picture the number 11 
appeared as a figure o f doom for
Wisconsin motorists in the month o f
July 
State Highway commission records
show 
That 11 more persons died in Wisconsin
traffic crashes in July than in
June 
That 11 pedestrians were among
the 79 persons killed last month 
That 11 more persons were killed
in July this year than in July last
year 
That at the end o f seven months
o f 1939 only 11 counties still have
escaped the sweep o f death over
streets and highways 
For Jackson county State Highway
commission records show one accident
with no fatalities and no injuries
this July compared with three
accidents no deaths and four injuries
for the same month o f 1938 This
county had one accident last month
in which no one was killed or injured 
but in which property damage
exceeded $50 per accident 
The visitor paid his bill at the
fashionable hotel and as he went out
he noticed a sign near the door 
 Have you left anything  
So he went back and spoke to the
manager 
 That sign s wrong he said It
should read Have you anything
left Ex
