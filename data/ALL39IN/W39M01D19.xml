         <p>Reorganization Short Lived
State government reorganisation as
conceived by Philip F La Follette
(exgovernor now touring Europe
a journalist) and approved by the
special session of the legislature in
October 1937 functioned less than one
year As this week begins 26 of the
changes in state government which
became effective under blanket order
of the 1937 legislature to Exgovernor
La Follette have been nullified
It was ju st a year ago January 10
th a t Phil La Follette called together
his reorganization committee com
posed of eight legislators and 14 state
departm ent officials Following that
first m eeting three transfers of state
departm ental service were announced
The beverage tax commission was
transferred to the tax commission the
municipal accounting division went
from the tax commission to the secretary
of sta te s office and the securities
division (then sm arting under the
lim elight of the Buckman Company investment
investigation) was taken
from the public service commission
and placed under the direction of the
sta te banking commission
The above three changes and 23
more were made by La Follette and
his committee under section 4 of the
reorganization bill This section also
carried the provision th at any and all
of the executive orders would remain
effective unless either branch of the
1939 legislature by m ajority resolution
vote disapproved within 10 days
afte r convening
Wisconsins 1939 legislature with a
RepublicanDemocrat coalition holding
more power than the Progressivecontrolled
legislature of 1937 needed but
three days to throw out reorganization
changes made by Progressives under
executive order
By a vote of 20 to 11 the state senate
brought about a hearty disapproval
of the executive transfers The
lower house the assembly had scheduled
a hearing for the same purpose
on Tuesday but its action if it continues
will mean nothing
In addition to the transfers of duties
and functions two new departm ents
were also created under executive
order One was the consolidated bureaus
of inspection and enforcement
and the other the departm ent of social
adjustm ent Both are now abolished
and their functions and duties will
again be performed by the old departments
from which they were shifted
Similarly all other transfers made by
La Follette and his committee will be
transferred back to old bosses and departm
ents
New Reorganization?
Republican and Democratic senators
in voting disapproval of Progressive
reorganization of state government
were willing to adm it th at there
probably is much good in some of the
departm ental transfers made hy La
Follette Asked to extend the time
lim it of 10 days for consideration of
the measure or to amend the resolution
to exempt some of the transfers
Republican leaders told Progressive
senators to bring in separate bills for
each of the transfers and promised
adequate hearings and consideration
of every proposal
Senator Roethe Fennimore Republican
fiewly elected president protem
of the senate has stated th a t he will
introduce a bill this week which will
incorporate some of the changes in
sta te government which were made by
Governor La Follette
The RepublicanDemocrat coalition
in presenting holding hearing and
voting on a m easure in three days
were accused and guilty of the same
procedure in parliam entary maneuvers
of which they accused Progressives in
the 1937 session They pointed out
however th a t Progressives put the 10
day lim it in the bill and th a t the only
course was to throw out everything
within the time specified in the bill
House Organizations
Neither senate or assembly had time
for much more than organization and
election of officers in the three days
of legislative meeting last week The
senate put in a little overtime w orking
Wednesday evening and Saturday
morning but only to undo La Follette
legislation as quickly as possible
The senate aside from giving the ax
to the reorganization bill elected
Edward J Roethe Fennimore publisher
Republican president protem  reappointed
Lawrence Larson Racine
Democrat and Emil H artm an Madison
Republican as clerk and sergeantat
arm s respectively and made comm
ittee appointments
The assembly elected Vernon Thompnon
Richland Center Republican as
speaker of the house appointed John i
Slocum W ausau Democrat clcrk and
Robert A Merrill Eau Claire a t ser
geantatarm s
Inereaaed Road Aid
S tate highway aids to counties
cities villages and towns will be increased
by 1375000 yearly if a bill
introduced by Carl M Nelson Med
ford and George H Hipke Stanley
both Republicans and J C Hanson
Deerfield Progressive becomes a law
A ppropriations now to the local
governmental units total about 11
million dollars a year The bill would
also change the law to perm it the use
of the aids fo r snow removal ice prevention
and dust control
The measure provides for increases
to counties of 65 a mile for improvement
of trunk highways Town and
village aids would be raised from 50
to 65 a mile Increases to cities
would be based on population with
cities under 10000 population receiving
130 a mile instead of the present
100 cities between 10000 and 36000
would have aids raised from 200 to
260 a mile cities between 36000 and
150000 390 a mile instead of 300
and in cities over 150000 the aid would
be jumped from 400 to 520 a mile
Unemployment Increase
Benefit claims under the sta te s un
employment compensation law increased
during December after having declined
during previous months the
industrial commission has announced
At the end of the last month about
23000 were applying for benefits compared
to 18500 at the end of November
said a report Payments during
December amounted to 528591
Benefit paym ents under the law during
1938 totalled more than 9percent m illion
dollars N et balance in the unemployment
reserve fund at the end
of the year was more than 38 million
dollars
Gat Tax Rebate
About 182000 Wisconsin citizens received
163232562 for taxes paid on
gasoline which was used for nonhighway
purposes during 1938 the
state tre a su re rs office reports
Over one million dollars of the refund
went to farm ers Industrial
m anufacturers received 9 per cent of
the refund railroads 28 per cent
dry cleaners 15 per cent and highway
and road contractors 13 per
Ä¢ent
The refunds amounted to about 8
ner cent of the nearly 21 million dollars
which the sta te collected in gasoline
taxes during the past year G asoline
taxes are the sta tes largest
single source of revenue and almost
Ä¢ouble the am ount received from income
tax Refunds for 1938 are the
largest they have been in any one

Use c f New Gym
Now that the school gymnasium is
ready for use the school board finds
itself faced with the problem of deciding
the m atter of charges if any
that are to be made when the gym is
used for other than school purposes
It will also be necessary for the school
board to lay down rules governing the
type of events not connected with the
school whether of a public or private
nature that may be held in the gym
The school board at present we
learn is inclined to believe th at each
of the several church organizations in
the village should be accorded the privilege
of using the gym once or twice
during the year at a nominal charge
On the whole the board is of the
opinion that the new gym should not
be classified as being ir competition
w ith locally established halls or meeting
places for public or private dances
entertainm ents etc It believes that
the gym should be used chiefly for
school and community affairs

the High School Gym at 300 oclock

of dollars yearly are taken from

M unkars Bad blood has stood betw

since last N ovem ber 2 when a Germ

U kraine (R uthenia) and gave added |

Munkacs is a key city in G erm anys
plan for vast C arpathoU krainian
fortifications slyly planned as a
th re a t to keep R ussia intim idated
while the Reich turns its attentions |
to winning concessions from France
and G reat B ritain both for itself
and Mussolini
When CzechH ungarian hostilities
broke out at Munkacs the inspiration
was obvious This tim e using
Czechoslovakia for a fro n t Hitler
was stirrin g up trouble which
will lead to a redem arcation of the
CzechH ungarian frontier bringing
strateg ic Munkacs back into his
power This done the Reich has
only to placate little H ungary Then
the chain of proG erm an sta te s will
extend from B altic to Balkans
These things happened ju st as
British P rim e M inister Neville
C ham berlain left for Rome where
observers expected him to m ake a
deal with Mussolini The probable
deal F ran ce would give Italy
Suez canal rights and joint use of
the DjiboutiAddis Ababa railroad
In return Italy would guarantee security
for British shipping in the
M editerranean also helping settle
B ritain s Palestine headache But
with H itler once m ore turning his
eyes w estw ard this could be interpreted
as only the beginning After
helping Mussolini win his dem ands

Race
G erm any originally planned to
finance deportation of Jew s by m aking
foreign pow ers buy her goods
The plan Jew ish em igrees would
tra d e th eir m oney forÄîor be
financed in the p urchase ofÄîG erm
an export products This plan won
little sym pathy from eith er B ritain
or the U S but it a t least offered a
basis for negotiation by which the
intergovernm ental refugee com m ittee
could deal both with G erm any
and Italy Since Italy s Jew ish persecution
is far less severe than G erm
anys P resident Roosevelt contacted
P re m ie r Mussolini shortly
after Ja n u a ry 1 asking him to urge
m ore leniency on C hancellor Hitler
Also suggested w as the settling of
Italian Jew s (who m ust leave by
F eb ru ary 1) in Ethiopia
A week later as P rim e Minister
C ham berlain left on his  appeasem
en t journey to Rom e it looked
like P resident Roosevelt had inadvertently
given the RomeBerlin
axis another weapon to hold over
D em ocracys head S m art Mussolini
probably on advice from the
even sm a rte r H itler was willing to
discuss the Roosevelt program with
Mr C ham berlain O bservers
thought he would agree but only if
Mr C ham berlain hastens French
capitulation to Italian territorial
claim s M eanwhile George Rublee
A m erican director of the refugee
com m ittee left for Berlin to negotiate
with H itler apparently willing
to consider a modification of the
R eichs program to blackm ail dem
ocracies into accepting unwanted
Jew s
Interesting as a sidelight was the
announcem ent of an Italian rep atriation
com m ission whose duty is to
m ake 10000000 racial Italians return
from foreign countries partly

WASHINGTONÄîCongress views
with a fishy eye the idea so popular
in the tre a su ry d epartm ent and
with exporters for large loans to
the various L atinA m erican countrie
s Of course th ere is the occasional
m em ber from a d istrict
w here factories are clam oring for
the o rd ers it is expected such loans
would aid B ut for the m ost p a rt
w hat happened to sim ilar loans
m ade for the sa m e tradeencouraging
purpose is still green in the
m em ory of the senators or re p re sen
tativ es them selves or th eir constituents
Of course the p resent situation is
com plicated by the supposed d esigns
of H itler and Mussolini on
L atin A m erica But so difficult is
any intelligent solution of this question
of loans th a t it m ight be se riously
argued it would be far better
not only for L atinA m erica but for
the U nited S tates if instead of calling
these proposed credits  loans
we would actually call them  g ifts
to s ta rt with!
I t som etim es happens th a t a hum
an being or a nation is g rateful
for a gift Its not a thing th a t can
be counted upon either in hum an
or national relationships but it does
happen once in a while C ertainly
it never has the opposite effect
But loans! They sim ply a re never
ap preciated O ccasionally in the
y e a rs th a t followed the w ar A m erican
tra v e le rs in E urope discovered
som e g ratitude dating back to the
A m erican relief which was purely
gratuitous But has anyone ever reported
any friendly feeling because
of the billions the United S tates
loaned the stricken E uropean nations
after the A rm istice? Which by
the w ay adds up to ju st a little less
than the totals of all debts to the
U nited States by those governm ents
a fte r the re ad ju stm en t dow nw ard of
th eir debts in the  settlem en t
ag reem en ts worked out while Calvin
Coolidge w as P resident So th a t the
socalled  w ar loans w ere a gift
afte r all even legally
World OuPt I s More Than
Twelve Billion Dollars
B ut consider the problem of furth
e r loans to L atin A m erica and
w hat will come later It m ay be
said th a t the m oney will never leave
this country Only the goods th at
the m oney thus  loaned will buy
T h at m ay be true But is any perm
an en t good accom plished by selling
goods for which one will probably
never be paid? E specially if the
d ebt thus accum ulated prom ises to
be a grievance m ore calculated to
m ake hard feeling a few y ears
henceÄîas in the case of the debts
of the Allies to the U nited S tatesÄî
than to be appreciated?
And how else could the tran sactions
term inate? A lready the world
owes the United S tates m ore than
12 billion dollars of which som e 4
billion is owed by L atin A m erica
 A ssum ing a willingness to pay how
is L atin A m erica going to do it?
i W hat is she going to use for money?
Gold? We dont w ant any m ore
even if L atin A m erica had it to pay
or m ight accum ulate it som e y ears
I hence Our governm ent has nearly
j fourteen and a half billion dollars
| w orth of gold now and no one is
sure w hat it is w orth to us or w hat
its value would be if the only big
| buyer in the world U ncle Sam  suddenly
stopped bidding 35 an ounce
I for it
j The only way L atin A m erica can
 pay is with goods or services But
! those m ust be goods o r services in
excess of goods and services which
the United S tates sells to Latin
I A m erica
Various Theories as to
! If hat Caused Depression
It is very popular am ong a m a teu
r econom ists and political alibi
seekers to blam e the depression
th a t sta rted with the cra sh of October
1929 on the w ar It is often
alleged th at this terrib le afterm ath
of the w ar engulfed the whole world
and th a t nothing the United S tates
could have done would have averted
it
Another school of econom ists
blam e w hat happened on the crazy
w ave of speculation in stocks the
pyram iding of prices until a crash
w as inevitable and th a t the crash
inevitably worked the depression
But another theory is being
evolved by some of the congressional
opponents of fu rth er loans to L atin
A m erica Which is th a t the chief
cause for the crash and the dep ression
th at followed w as nothing except
the fact that the United S tates
had gone hogwild loaning its good
m oney not only in E urope but to
Latin A m erica to a grand total of
nearly 15 billion dollars!
Not th at in parting w ith this m oney
we parted with goods which we !
la te r needed for our own economic
salvation T hat is the sam e sort of
cockeyed econom ics th a t blam es it
on the afterm ath of the w ar Actually
the chief econom ic afterm ath
of the w ar w as debt and we owed
the d ebt to ourselves! So the m oney
spent on paying in terest on this
debt and in retirin g p a rt of the
principalÄîduring the A ndrew Mellon
reg im eÄîw as paid to our own
citizens and eith er spent here for
goods or invested in en terp rises
w hich tended to produce em ploym
ent
Actually America Was
Loaning Goods Vol Money
No the real trouble of the huge
loans back in the tw enties w as th at
we w ere actually loaning goods not
m oney and in producing such a
volum e of goods so th a t we could
m eet our own needs and the ordin
a ry dem and for exports and in
addition ship these billions of dolla
rs w orth of goods which in a way
we w ere selling on credit we ran
into difficulties W hat happened was
th a t every line of activity th a t was
producing for the export tra d e was
expanded beyond any sensible
rhym e or reason
T rue we w ere using up our own
savings to finance these exports
T hat is w hat it am ounted to But
this alone would not have been serious
If we had a sane system of
production and distribution exporting
only w hat other nations could afford
to pay for and we could afford
to tak e paym ent for by buying their
goods the m ere loss of our savings
would affect only the individuals
stung with the sour bonds A ctually
th a t loss so far as totals are
concerned would not have been
trag ic though of course it would
h ave seem ed so to m any of the individuals
In his acceptance speech in 1932
F ran k lin D Roosevelt inquired w hat
had happened to the profits the corporations
m ade during the good
years
 Som e of th em  he said  went
to additions to plants now standing
s ta rk and idle
T hey w ere standing sta rk and idle
because they had been built to produce
ex p o rts for people who would
never pay for them  When we
stopped the loansÄîbecause of popular
clam o r after a few d efaultsÄîwe
stopped the exports T h at closed
down the factories produced a vicious
circle U nem ployed cannot
buy So the factories which had
been supplying the w orkers who had
been producing for export closed
down And so on
Changing Sentiment About
Third Term for Roosevelt
Not so m any people expect F ra n k lin
D Roosevelt to run for a third
term as did six m onths or a y e a r
ago This is the alm ost unanim ous
rep o rt brought back to W ashington
from various p a rts of the country
by se n ato rs and rep resentatives
T his has nothing to do with w hether
these people who have changed
th eir own predictions w ant Roosevelt
to run again or not It has
nothing to do with w hether they
would like to have him in the White
House for four m ore years It has
nothing to do even with w hether
they favor a continuance of the
New Deal policies It is m erely a
change of their honest convictions
as to w hat Roosevelt him self intends
to do
T here has obviously been a decline
in popularity of som e of the
New Deal policies This w as am ply
dem onstrated by the prim ary
and election results Yet m ost of
the returning congressm en say
th at lots of people voted for anti
New D eal D em ocrats and even for
R epublicans who a re still strong for
R ooseveltÄîm any who would like to
see Roosevelt continue in the White
House for four m ore years
W hether sentim ent again st a third
term is strong enough to b eat as
popular a figure as Roosevelt is a
question on which there is a wide
v arian ce of opinion am ong the cong
ressm en who n aturally enough
have been listening eagerly to their
constitu en ts opinions
What Results Will Flow
From Change of Opinion?
The im portance ifi this change of
opinion as to w hether he will run
or not lies in the n atu ral results
which m ay be expected to flow from
it Its m ere consideration will show
even a person unfam iliar w ith politics
why a P resident m ust not say
th a t he is not going to run again
F or the logical result is for people
who believe firmly th a t the P re sident
is not going to run to line up
behind som e other candidate Convinced
th a t the P re sid en t will not
be a candidate people natu rally
s ta rt figuring whom they prefer to
take this place T heir reasoning
m ay be based on sheer patriotism Äî
which m an other than Roosevelt
would be best for the country? Or
it m ight be based entirely on selfish
in terest Äî which m an other than
R oosevelt in the White House would
probably be best for m y pocketbook
p erh ap s as a business m an
perhaps as a recipient of relief p e rhaps
as a tax payer? O r as we ascend
the scale in politÄòcal im portance
it would probably tak e a
m ore personal turn Thus the question
to any politician would beÄî
which m an other than Roosevelt is
I a p t to do m ore for m e as to con
| suiting m e on patronage nam ing
m y political lieutenants to office
etc? The politician also would
I weigh very carefully the odds on
i this candidate aiding his enem ies

CHA PTER IVÄîContinued
When the gam es ended B ert and
H ale went u p sta irs together Hale
had expected to say a brisk goodn
ight at the door of his room  When
he realized th at young Kneeland
w as lingering on the threshold as if
he had som ething to say he changed
his m ind A teteatete with the son
of the house in this new mood of
his m ight reveal som ething worth
knowing
 Come in and have a c ig a re tte 
he invited and K neeland w as across
the threshold before he had finished
the sentence Once there however
his selfconsciousness returned He
w as very fidgety and bungled sim ple
actions like the lighting of his
cig arette His hand shook as he
stru ck a second m atch H ale observ
ed this and m ade an inw ard
com m ent  The boys nerves are
shot to pieces But when the two
m en w ere com fortably seated in
easychairs by an open window facing
the sea Kneeland relaxed
 I dont intend to keep you very
long he began apologetically ÄòÄòI
ju st w ant to say now Ive a chance
to do it th a tÄîwellÄîth at I think
your being here for this su m m er is
a corking idea I m strong for it
ÄòÄòThanks I m glad you feel th at
way If you dont m ind telling m e
Hex added with a grin ÄòÄòI d be
glad to know why you do
K neeland w as taken aback by the
d irectn ess of the question He
flushed and stam m ered
ÄòÄòWhy the usual reasons I suppose
F it in and all th at sort of
th in g  he said uneasily He added
w ith m ore assurance ÄòÄòI think you
can be very helpful to Dad I guess
you can see th a t I m a total loss to
him  so fa r
H ale m ade a pet feet sm oke ring
 In w hat way can I help your fath
e r ?  he asked quietly
K neeland sta red a t him
ÄòÄòI dont know w h ats on D ads
m in d  he said slowly ÄòÄòHe h asn t
m entioned the m a tte r to m e except
to say youd be hre this sum m er
Ä¢n d handle his hem e m ail At a
guess I d say he lik is you and thinks
youd brighten us up God knows
we need brightening
His voice sharpened and rose
as he w ent on and his m ask slipped
aside a trifle ÄòÄòWr seem to be getting
horribly on one ano th ers
n e rv e s he jerked out ÄòÄòCraig c a n t
talk of anything but diseased brains
I m so rry now I j¬ªsked him here
Ainsw orth rides Dfd as if he w ere
Ä¢ cowboy on a bucking broncho and
Dad a c ts as if he u e r e the broncho
H e doesnt kick the bounder off the
prem ises and I c a n t im agine why
Iv e asked him  He shut m e up in
Ä¢ h u rry 
Y ou havent kicked C raig off the
p rem ises eith er H ale said gently
H e offered his guest a fresh cigar
e tte and lit another for him self
H e rb e rts m ask settled into place
again
ÄòÄòT h ats a different m a tte r he
said stiffly  C raig s m y best pal
Weve been together p retty consta
n tly the last five years I ts been
m ighty decent of him to bother with
a bonehead like m e But I h av en t
had a whole su m m er of him before
andÄî he stopped
 What does be taL of when youre
alone w ith h im ? H ale asked casu ally
Young K neelands voice dropped
 The sam e thing but m ore of it
H e tells m e about his dam ned experim
en ts and his clinic cases He
says he knows Im Interested in ev erything
th at concerns him He says
he has no one elsa to talk to and
I guess th a ts a fact H es a lonely
chap I suppose th a ts why he puts
up with m e He actually asked m e
to sit in his laboratory and w atch
h im ca rv e up his cadavers A fter
one go of that I drew the line right
th e re  B ert shuddered  Now I
keep p retty m uch to m yself in the
d aytim e I hustle off alone in m y
baat or car I have to h e a r ail
about hia work a t night though
Y ouve heard his gay p rattle at dinn
er He com es to m y room when
we go u p sta irs and talks his head
off He knows I dont like it I m
bored stiff by it In fact I h ate it
ButÄîwell hes frightfully ta c tle ss
 You dont m ean he has cad av ers
h e re ?  Rex asked in am azem ent
K neeland looked a t him u n certainly
He appeared to fear th at he had
said too m uch It w as equally clear
how ever th at he w as finding a certain
satisfaction in pouring out these
revelations
 Not whole ones he m uttered
a t last  Bits Pickled in a sm all
vat he h as up in his laboratory He
gets the things from his hospital
B rains m ostly T h eres no secret
about it he hastened to add  The
v at is alw ays fastened with a com bination
lock when he isnt there and
the serv an ts have ord ers to keep out
of the room He cleans it himself
He considers every m inute lost
when he isnt experim enting or talking
about his cases Craig thinks
h es on the verge of a big discovery
I guess he is Hes so infernally
clever But I wish to God
h ed stop talking about it
He had got back to his grievance
and Rex nodded
On the face of it the thing w as
sim ple enough A case of scientific
passion selfishness and u tter selfabsorption
H ale w as looking beyond
the elder K neelands room w as
Jo a n s room  Thia w as directly opposite
th a t in which C raig m ade
him self com fortable w ith Ainsworth
a s hia nextdoor neighbor Mrs
Spencer F orbes and Miss Hosanna
had too room s and a connecting
bathroom at the front end of the
hall directly acro ss from H ales
q u arters T here w ere also two
guest room s on the third floor
w here C raig had his laboratory
These of course w ere now unoccupied
H ale locked his door and strolled
tow ard his w riting table He felt
very wideawake He decided to
w rite a letter or two to quiet his
nerves before trying to sleep He
w as not certain th at young Kneelands
confidence and disingenuousness
w ere entirely sincere The lad
would bear w atching
He reached the w riting table
pulled out his chair and stopped
short He had been pleased by the
tab les sensible location next to the
r e a r window and by the generous
supply of stationery its num erous
d raw ers contained
Now directly under his eyes one
of its sheets of letterp ap er lay before
him It w as w hite with the
w ords  Halcyon C am p em bossed
across the top in d ark grsen The
post office ad d ress and telephone
num ber of the C am p w ere engraved
in the righthand corner It was
Why should M rs N ash give Ja n e a cat?
low the face of it and his own face
grew grave H is reply w as still
casual
 C raig is a selfcentered type
he said  He has lived and worked
alone so long th a t he has lost his
sense of proportion We had a m an
at H uelva who w as like that The
re st of us fled from him as if he
had been a cholera germ 
He talked on m aking an am using
story of the experience w ith the
m an a t H uelva H erbert brightened
H ale had got w hat he w anted He
kept the conversation on an im personal
plane during the rest of the
call and K neeland responded eag e rly
He stayed an hour longer evidently
unwilling to leave At last
he glanced a t hia w rist w atch and
jum ped up with an apology
 Awfully so rry  he said  I
had no idea how lateÄî
 I ts been a bully ta lk  Hale
w ent w ith him to the door and
paused there with his hand on the
knob
 If I w ere you he suggested
cheerfully  I wouldnt let C raig
m ake any m ore night visits I d
lock the door and let him think I
w as asleep 
H erb ert shook his brown head
 I tried th a t a few tim es he
ad m itted  He didnt like it He
w as funny about itÄîsurprised and
aw fully hurt He says it helps him
to th resh things out with m e He
says it clears his brain and that
so rt of thing
 All right L et him clear his
b rain som e other w ay H ale retorted
 I think he needs some m ental
housecleaning J u s t lock yourself
in and snore when he raps
A fter a few tim es he m ay get the
idea th a t you w ant some sleep
Youve got to have it I dont believe
I d sleep a t all if he spent
m an y of the night hours describing
his experim ents to m e 
 I dont sleep m uch H erbert
confessed He added in a relieved
tone  I think I ll take your advice
Anyway I ll try it
 D ont mind if he doesnt like
it H ale laughed  It will be good
for him to learn th at he c a n t have
everything he likes H es being
abom inably selfish about this
He stood by his open door for a
m om ent looking afte r young Kneelands
d isappearing figure He had
learned through the casual talk
around him since his arriv al that
the son of the house slept a t the
re a r end of the upper hall next
to his fa th e rs room and bath and on
the sam e side as H ales room Benot
these things a t which Hale
looked He had seen them before
The paper w as a sheet from his own
supply But directly in its center
erect and m alignant w as a very
clever pen and ink sketch of a cobra
coiled to strike Below it four printed
w ords straggled down the side of
the page
WHY WATE FOR THIS?
This tim e H ale did not grin over
the m essage He looked a t it
thoughtfully for a long m om ent
Then he im paled it on a pin and
picked it up He dropped it into an
envelope took a billcase from an
inside pocket put the envelope into
it and restored the case to the pocket
He undressed slowly and deliberately
He had considerable
thinking to do He decided to do it
in bed in the u n distracting darkness
R eturning from the bathroom in his
p ajam as and m oving tow ard his
bed he again stopped short with a
muffled exclam ation Something
w as pressing against his feet He
looked down He had turned out all
the lights save the one bulb on the
reading lam p over his bed By ita
glow however he distinctly saw his
visitor It w as a large and really
beautiful black cat with green eyes
and a green ribbon around its neck
The ribbon ended in a sm a rt bow
Hale sta re d down at the anim al
wondering how it had got into his
room It m ight have slipped past
him unnoticed when he opened the
door to speed H erbert on his way
 Dont you know this isnt a safa
house for an im als? he asked i t
 T heres a vivisectionist experim
enting on the top floor! Ju s t the
sam e I ll have to put you out I
can t have you prowling around
here all n ight
On second thought he picked up
the purring creature and then
crossed to the bell and rang it It w as
after m idnight but he had seen th at
the lower hall was still lit when H erbert
left Banks m ust be som ew here
around He would m ake an effort
to put the c a t into Banks care
B anks w as around He responded
to the bell alm ost at once His
im passive face brightened when he
saw the cat
 I ju st discovered this visitor
Hale explained  I fancy shes been
asleep under the bed
 Thank you sir Banks took the
anim al which accepted the change
philosophically though with a lingering
backw ard glance at her
host  Ja n e will be relieved s ir
he added  Shes been in quite a
state about the cat all evening
 Its her c a t? 
 Yes sir M rs Wilbur N ash sent
it over this m orning as a present
Ja n e w as pleased But shes a little
overanxious seeing w hats happened
to the other pets H er n a m e 
Banks added stroking the c a ts
head  is D aisy 1
 Why should Mrs Nash give Ja n e
a c a t?  H ale asked curiously  Is
Ja n e an old em ployee of h ers? 
No sir Ja n e s sister Ellen
worked for Mrs Nash for five years
Then one day Ellen fell down the
cellar steps in Mrs N ashs town
house and broke her neck It w as a
m ost unusual occurrence sir It
got into the new spapers It m ade a
strong bond between Mrs Nash and
Jane Mrs N ash Banks added
solemnly  paid all the funeral expenses
 And gives Ja n e cats besides I
see A generous n a tu re 
Hale threw open the door
 P ut Daisy to bed and seek your
own respose he invited For a
m om ent he watched B anks sedate
progress down the hall As he stood
there he heard the sound of light
tappng at the far end of the corridor
He glanced along the passage
C raig stood at H erb erts door
tapping on it gently but persistently
Hale returned to his room  slipped
on his dressing gown and strolled
out of the room and down the hall
Craig w as still at H erb erts door
He w as no longer tapping He was
m erely waiting H ale approached
him with a winning sm ile
Anything I can do? he asked
cheerfully
No thanks I m erely wanted a
word with B ert C raig sta red at
him bleakly and without moving
 I think hes sound asleep Hale
suggested  I hope so I thought
he looked ih tonight You se e he
added glancing at his w rist watch
 I ts pretty late I ts tw enty m inutes
to one I thought you m ight be
sick when I heard you tapping Can
I offer you a drink or anything?
No thanks I m turning in m yself
Good night
The look that went with the words
w as not a benediction Hale responded
to it with a friendly nod
He heard C raigs bedroom door
close with a snap as he returned to
his own room

Com and alfalfa will m ake about
the m ost profitable ration the lam b
feeder can provide for his flock this
w inter If both feeds are of good
quality it is doubtful at present
prices th at a supplem ent of any
kind need be fed
Whole shelled corn has been found
a m ost suitable grain ration When
on full feed lam bs weighing from
60 to 85 pounds should eat from one
and onehalf to two pounds of grain
per head daily including any supplem
ent provided and from one and
onefourth to one and onehalf
pounds of hay If a com m on rough
! age is used such as p rairie hay a
1 protein supplem ent should be fed at
the rate of one pound daily to each
| five lam bs The supplem ent can be
linseed oil m eal corn gluten m eal
j cottonseed oil m eal or soybean oil
m eal depending on which is lowest
in cost If corn is not available
i whole barley oats w heat or rye
j m ay be fed alone Feeding oats
I alone however is not recom m end
 ed for fattening lam bs but only
I for starting lam bs on feed and finally
should not m ake up m ore than 25
| per cent of the grain ration
Lam bs should gain at least one
| third of a pound daily m aking a
gain of 25 to 30 pounds in 75 to 100
I days of feeding An efficient feede
r will have his lam bs fat enough to
I kill out well and suitable to the
! packer in th at period of tim e Slightly
above 90 pounds is a good weight
| to begin m arketing lam bs if they
a re fat
E xperim ents show th at it is best
to feed all the grain lam bs will clean
up in about 20 m inutes tim e twice a
day Hay also is best fed twice daily
The hay should be fed after the
lam bs have eaten their grain

A num ber of things m ay cause
hens to lay soft shelled eggs am ong
which are fright close inbreeding
and diseases like fowl pox coccidiosis
and laryngotracheitis
Hens th at are too fat m ay lay soft
shelled eggs the egg sim ply slipping
through lay ers of fat too quickly
to allow the shell to form  E xcessive
feeding of m angels or cabbage
which causes looseness of the
bowels m ay result in the ap p earance
of m any poor shelled eggs But
the chief cause of soft shelled eggs
according to an authority in the
Missouri F a rm e r is a low assim ilation
of lim e by the layers The
lim e m ay be available in the form
of oystershell and still this will happen
The oystershell m ay become
covered with d irt and hence be unappetizing
or vitam in D m ay be deficient
which does not allow a proper
assim ilation It is a good plan
to keep the oystershell fresh stir it
daily or sprinkle some over the
m ash so as to stim ulate consum ption
and then m ake sure th at the
laying m ash contains at least 2 per
cent cod liver oil so as to insure a
proper supply of vitam in D Hard
g rit should also be available at all
tim es
It is im portant to guard against
soft shelled eggs because it encourages
the eggeating habit which is
so expensive wher eggs are high in
price

An A rab m ay sell his wifeÄîor one

Dr Fairchild retu rn ed with enthusiastic

So fa r as this courier knows
the suggestion by Maj Jam es
R Randolph that rockets may
replace heavy artillery for longrange
bom bardm ent of cities is
the first official recognition of
their possible use in w arfare
He specifically cites the work of
D octor Goddard at a tim e when
Doctor G oddard is piling up
new patents and getting some of
his biggest sizzlers under control
It is also the tim e when
the tiny motored plane evolving
from the toy and controlled

as a possible bom bdropper
At Roswell N M financed b the
Daniel G uggenheim foundation
Doctor Goddard has a unique desert
laboratory with plenty of elbow
room and sky room He now has a
gyro steering m echanism on his
rockets by which they m ay be accurately
aim ed He has gained 30
per cent in range over his best shots
of two years ago and is now forcing
his rockets to a speed of 700 miles
p er hour
His m ost valuable contribution
to rocketeering noted by M ajor
Randolph is his continuous flow
of power instead of the single
initial explosion Gasoline and
oxygen mixing and exploding

Doctor Goddard an am iable unassum

Heil Heil!
Wisconsin can strut like a peacock
among the S tates this week! Her
governor supplied Time magazine with
its cover for the week of January 16th
and received a 6 column writeup with
cuts under  National Affairs (H itler
received only 3 columns more the week
before as man of the year )
And what does Time have to say
about our Governor? He is described
as a ruddy energetic thick accented
selfmade industrialist and hardheaded
business man He is also called
Julius (the Ju st) Heil
History? He was born in Germany
brought to the U S at the age of 3
and orphaned at the age of 12
He manicured horses and waited
on customers for a Wisconsin country
storekeeper when he was 12 years old
He learned about machinery by running
a drill press at 14 for International
H arvester Co He learned about
trolley cars by being a conductor in
Milwaukee
He founded his own business in 1900
with the first 700 he saved and for
ten years paid himself only 2 a day
Often he borrowed from the neighborhood
saloon keeper to meet his payroll
Today the Heil Company employs
1800 people makes oil burners
oil and milk tanks for trucks etc
Julius Heil can boast that his worker?
have never struck and that during the
depression he spent 600000 of his
companys reserves to keep them on
the payroll cleaning machinery repairing
plants keeping up the
grounds
When Phil La Follette cried out
against his money bags Candidate
Heil replied typically Sure I m a
rich man And I bet you wish you
had more vultures like me who employ
men and provide jobs
Economy was Candidate Heils
campaign watchword but when Governor
Heil sat down to make good he
came face to face with the political
fact th at some of the biggest items of
government cost nowadays are the
hardest to reduce For example
pensions relief welfare highways
public education His business accomplishments
have been markedly
successful His gubernatorial achievements
cannot be predicted
W hatever m istakes La Follette may
have made as he left office let us not
forget th at Wisconsin owes much of
her prestige as a state today to the
La Follette leadership
Now that elections are over it
would be well for us to forget Party
differences and remember th at our
first duty as American citizens is to
support the adm inistration at the
helm of state affairs giving due credit
to the past adm inistration for its accomplishments

of the congregatios would in time
take active part in the work of the
congregation and thus become fam iliar
with the problems connected therewith
In the election C J Sundet was
chosen to succeed John Nessheim who
had served as a member of the board
of trustees for 20 years Erick Hanson
was elected to succeed Iver Sam pson
as a member of the church council

best th a ts a dangerous job in an oil refinery An open flam e is alw ays
risky when th eres oil around and a w elder has to do his work w ith a

T akes E v ery Safety P recau tio n 
On the night of N ovem ber 6 1929 B arney had a job to do on
one of the big hundred foot tow ers and he took every precaution
possible The weld he w as to m ake was on the inside of the towe
r 90 feet from the ground and 10 feet from the top He had to
clim b up U th at spot from the inside through a m ess of pipes
and roils but before he sta rted he m ade a m ental note of the
fact th at there w as also a ladder running up the outside of th a t
tower to a m anhole at the top If anything went wrongÄîif sp ark s
from his welding a p p aratu s set flre to the oil down at the bottom 
there w as a way out
But Barney w asn t going to s ta rt any fires if he could help it
To m ake doubly sure he took along a helper and left him a t the
opening at the bottom of the tow er with instructions t¬´ w atch
for any sp ark s falling from above and put them out the m inute
they landed When th at w as done he sta rte d clim bing up to the
spot w here the welding w as to be done
 Up I clim bed says B arney  and w ent rig h t to work as fa st as
I could I was working a t night because it w as cooler but it w as still
plenty hot and I w anted to finish as soon as possible and get out in the

Try it Then Äî see your doctor
He probably will tell you to continue
with the Bayer Aspirin because
it acts so fast to relieve discomforts
of a cold And to reduce
fever
This simple way backed by
scientific authority has largely supplanted
the use of strong medicines
in easing cold symptoms Perhaps
the easiest most effective way yet

He landed spraw lingÄîon som ething soft
air again I worked steadily for about an hour and then I noticed th a t
a thick sm oke w as accum ulating in the tow er
Barney noticed the sm oke but he d id n t pay m uch attention to
it T here a re alw ays fum es presen t around an oil well and he
figured th at if anything had gone wrong down a t the bottom his
helper would have w arned him long since He was anxious to
finish th at job he w as w orking on and he w as working at top
speed Working so absorbedly th a t he d id n t pay any attention
to anything else He d id n t even stop to tak e a glance down the
shaft And th a t absorption alm ost cost him his life
W elder Light Saves His Life
It was the light of his w elder th a t saved him  Saved him by going
out! As long as it w as working the tow er w as bright as day But suddenly
it diedÄîand then B arney noticed th a t it w asn t the only light in
th a t tower A bright red glow w as com ing up the long shaft from
below The bottom of the tow er w as on fire!
The first thing th a t entered B arneys m ind w as a question Why
hadnt his helper w arned him ? Loudly he shouted the helpers natue
But there was no answ er At th a t m om ent B arney w as m ore alarm ed
for his helper than for him self T here w as th a t m anhole a t the top of
the tower and the ladder leading down the side He could get out th a t
way But if his helper d id n t answ er som ething m ust have happened
Barney sta rted for the top It took him hardly any tim e at
all to clim b that 10 feet and reach the upper m anhole But th ere
a surprise waited for him Äîa surp rise th at stru ck te rro r into B arneys
heart A beam of wood a foot sq u a re was blocking the
opening!
 I couldnt get m y hand through th a t opening let alone m y h ead 
Barney says  And I couldnt m ove the beam because there w as a b l¬´ k
and fall attached to it T here I was with the heavens above m e und
hell down below But the heavens w ere out of m y reach and w hat lay
below w as hell and no m istake1
But down w as the only way B arney could go so down he w ent
The blaze didnt look as though it w ere reaching fa r up the shaft M aybe
he had a chance afte r all
 The farth er down I w ent says B arney  the m ore seared
I got The sm oke was th ick er and the h eat w as terrific For
a m om ent I played with the idea of staying in the tow er and
waiting until the flam es w ere discovered and put out But In
my h eart I knew th a t w ouldnt work It w as late a t night Supposing
no one discovered the b laie? Suppose it sp read and tb
whole place w ent up in flam es?
He Made a D rive for the Bottom Opening
NoÄîB arney knew he had to tak e his chances with th a t flre On down
he went He was alm ost a t the bottom  and the flam es w ere licking up
a t his feet when he played his last card He pulled his ju m p er over his
head and with hands protected by his heavy gloves he dropped into the
m idst of the blazing inferno and m ade a drive for the bottom opcningl
One blast of heat and then B arney w as through the opening
his body hot and his clothes sm oking He landed spraw ling
on som ething soft Harney pulled the ju m p er off his head and
took a look at th a l soft object It w as his helperÄîju st waking
up from a sound sleep
 He jum ped up says B arney an d took one look a t me And I
h av en t seen him since! When it w as all over there w asn t a single
hum on my body But ju st the sam e I did no m ore work th at night
I let the fire boys do the rest w ith the steam hose

eyeglasses but I stress h air styling
and lip rouge
In the first place if your eyes
a re so weak th at constant use of
g lasses is necessary the less you
ta m p e r with them the better The
sim plest care of daily bathing with
a reliable lotion and healing drops
prescribed by your occulist should
be the extent of your fussing Plenty
of re st and eye exercise of course
but no m ascara nor eye shadow nor
penciling
Touch up your brows yes and
keep them trim  But do not pluck
them to a thin line Many physicians
offer the opinion th at too frequent
plucking of the eyebrow
w eakens the eyes So you see?
C o n cen tra te on
H air a n d Lips
P ut on your glasses and sit before
your m irror Comb your hair
softly around your face Change
your reg u lar part E xperim ent
In m ost cases hair brought down
softly over the ears fluffed a bit to
fall out on the cheek just below the
e a r shaft of the glasses is the m ost
flattering
But if you are the sleek type and
com b your hair back from your
face then you m ust accent your
lips to d etract from the fram es Full
lips of rich color not too deep
does a lot for you
Sleek or fem inine in h air style
the m anner in which you rouge your
lips is most im portant Try two
lip sticks The lighter color for the
upper lip the deeper tone for the
lower lip Liquid lip rouge painted
on with a fine brush and a steady
hand is the most lasting It takes
a little practice to apply it well but
it is worth the effort in the end
Keep your hair glossy with daily
j ca re  and nicely set Keep your
 skin clear and your teeth sparkling
w hite your brows trim and your
| lip coloring intact and I can vouch
| that your eyeglasses will be hardly
! noticed
If you feel the desire for some
! eye m akeup rely on vaseline or a
| reliable eye oil with which to light
! ly m assage your lids and lashes
They glisten and give som e depth
| to the eyes and a re also beneficial

your health Sleep exercise and

you carry  your voice and your sta te
of health
 If you a re physically below par
you may have a nervous disorder
which should be taken c a re of but
otherw ise you should be able to keep
well by eating proper food at regular
hours getting eight nine or ten
hours of sleep and by exercising
in the fresh a ir and sunlight
 Dont alw ays com plain of being

Possible Effects on Longevity
The avowed objectives of m odern
nutritional scientists are to
help hum anity to enjoy happier
healthier and longer
lives If any one
vitam in could be
said to have m ore
influence than any
other on longevity
the distinction m ost
certainly would be
accordedÄîso far
as present knowledge
is concerned
Äîto vitam in G
E xtensive laboratory
experim ents
by investigators who a re p a ra m
ount in their field seem to indica
te th a t vitam in G has a pronounced
effect upon the m ain tenance
of health and vigor at all
ages It has been dem onstrated
with experim ental anim als th a t a
diet containing m ore vitam in G
than is required for norm al
 grow th resulted in g re a te r vigor
a postponem ent of the onset of
senility and a com paratively short
period of the m ental and physical
infirm ities we usually associate
 with old age
Effect on Digestion and Nerves
do not lack for adequate am ounts
of vitam in G
Sources of Vitamin G
B ecause vitam in G is closely a ssociated
with vitam in B some
hom em akers occasionally confuse
the two This is not surprising
inasm uch as it was some years
following the initial recognition of
vitam in B th at scientists established
beyond a doubt th at there
w as m ore than one growthprom
oting vitam in Subsequently
they learned th a t while the substance
la te r nam ed vitam in G
w as frequently found in close association
with vitam in B such
was not alw ays the case F or exam
ple vitam in G is known to occur
w ithout vitam in B in egg
white
Milk Meet Eggs Greens
The rich est sources of vitam in
G are the concentrates of yeast
yeast e x tra c t and w heat germ  Alm
ost equally well supplied with
this vitam in are liver and kidney
Muscle cuts of m eat contain v itamin
G but in lesser am ounts than
liver and kidney
The vitam in is also found in
young green plants and it is interesting
to note th at the vitam in
is form ed during the growth of the
plant and decreases with m atu rity
The am ount of the vitam in
broccoli the flower buds are said
to contain only half as m uch a t
the leaves while the stem s con
tain even less Among the greens
turnip tops and beet tops hav¬´
been found to be unusually rich
Investigations indicate th at w eight
for weight they a re tw ice as rich
as eggs though eggs a re considered
a good source
H om em akers will be glad to
learn th a t heating does not ap p ear
to destroy vitam in G Canned
foods a re therefore as good a
source as though they had not
been processed
Milk m ust not be overlooked
For all practical purposes and
chiefly because of the am ounts in
which it is consum ed it is probably
our m ost im portant source of
the G vitam in
One thing is certain Homem
ak ers should striv eÄînot for
diets th at a re m erely adequate in
j vitam in G    but for a surplus
to help build high resistance One
authority has advised a ration th at
contains four tim es the am ount
considered absolutely necessary
The surplus should help to provide
a h ead start tow ard the goal
of buoyant health
L aboratory experim ents have j has been found to vary with differ
I also indicated th a t when there is 1 en Pa r s of the sam e plant In
a shortage of vitam in G digestion Äî  
is usually im paired In this respect
a shortage of vitam in G has
 a slightly different effect than a
| deficiency of vitam in B A defi
! nite lack of vitam in B causes an
abrupt and com plete loss of appetite
Withholding vitam in G api
p e a rs to affect the desire for food
I so th a t experim ental anim als con
I sum e only about tw othirds as
m uch as they would norm ally
take
A form of nervous depression
m ay occur when the diet is low in
vitam in G for any protracted
length of tim e O ther unfortunate
consequences m ay be a decline in
the health of the skin Studies
i with anim als indicated th at when
| the vitam in w as withheld not
| only did a loss of weight occur
i but there w ere other signs of nu
! tritional failure These included
! an inflamm ation of the m outh a
loss of hair a thickening and in
i som e cases a cracking and scaling
of the skin
Vitamin G and Healthy Eyes
j Studies with a variety of experi

startling disclosure th at on diets
j lacking vitam in G the health of
I the eyes was distinctly affected#
I Not only w as there a loss of
! hair around the eyes but the eye
I ball developed a whitish appear
| ance which w as determ ined to be
cataract
At present scientists a re not

findings m ay be onfirmed

Questions Answered
Mrs G M LÄîThe term  w ater
balance about which you inquired
is used to describe the situation
in which the available w ater from
food beverages and th at m anufactured
in the body equals that
of the w ater excreted or lost from
the body It is to help keep the
body in w ater balance th at the
daily diet m ust contain adequate
am ounts of fluids
E  G M J r ÄîYes it is true th at
approxim ately onethird of the
protein required during infancy is
stored by the childs body to take
care of growth and developm ent
As children grow older the
am ount of protein stored for
growth gradually decreases until
they become adults
