Employment Peace Act
The employment peace a c t (the
proposed bill to replace the Wisconsin
labor act of 1937) so labeled by its
rponsors the Wisconsin Council of
A griculture will have anything but a
peaceful journey through the legislature
if the initial public hearing on
the bill can be used as a yard stick
The first round in a legislative fight
which promises to be the most bitter
of any m easures now aw aiting legislative
action took place last Thursday
when more than 600 persons crowded
into the assembly chambers
To begin with Milo K Swanton
executive secretary of the Wisconsin
Council of A griculture the Council is
made up of more than 37 farm organizations
claiming to represent more
than 80000 farm ersasserted th at he
wanted to first explain th a t many
thousands of farm ers affiliated with
the Council feel th a t they are friends
of labor
Henry J Ohl president of the Wisconsin
Federation of Labor state
chapter of the AFL the first to represent
opponents of the bill began by
nailing the lie th a t there exists any
w ar between labor and the farm er
There is no w ar he said Labor
will be 100 per cent back of farm
program s despite the hostility of the
group back of this bill
Labor questioned and doubted that
the real farm er would support the bill
as in the words of Joseph Padway
chief counsel for the federation of
labor I w ant to ask the honest-to-
God farm ers not the council or those
who dupe the farm ers when labor has
ever hurt you 
Again sim ilarly sponsors of the bill
sought to point out th at the opinions
and desires of the common laborer
were not represented by labor spokesmen
and labor organizers or as stated
by Assemblyman Reuben Peterson
who introduced the bilT fo r the Council
The bill was drafted to give the
rank-and-file of labor relief from
spokesm an domination and dictation
Proponed Labor Change
The proposed labor bill as drafted
by the Wisconsin Council of Agriculture
would m aintain the present three
men sta te labor board as a judicial
tribunal without investigative authority
the members to be appointed by
the governor with the senates consent
I t provides for a 10 day notice
prior to a strike if perishable products
are involved I t seeks to outlaw sitdown
strikes and secondary picketing
and also bar closed shops unless 75
per cent of the employees vote for
such collective bargaining by secret
ballot Picketing would also be prohibited
unless a m ajority of employees
vote to strike
Labor as represented by CIO and
AFL leaders maintained th at
1 The proposed law would not help
farm ers or cooperatives because all
farm cooperative labor problems have
and will continue to be handled by the
federal labor relations board
2 R ather than see the present labor
law amended they preferred to have
the law repealed outright
3 If the proposed measure is
passed labor will boycott the Wisconsin
board and take all cases to the
national labor board
4 The Councils bill is undemocratic
and a violation of the free speech
guarantee of the U S constitution
5 This bill would w rite out and
destroy forever the individual rights
of workers
Rural Telephones Exem pt?
Many of the sm aller fa n n e r telephone
companies in Wisconsin will be
wiped out if the provisions of the
federal wages and hours act are ap
plied to them  investigation by the
public service commission reveals
The commission has therefore asked
the federal departm ent to exempt exchanges
with few er than 1000 customers
from the act
If the act were applied to the small
companies rates in many cases would
have to be doubled there would be a
reduction in telephone usage in small
i r communities and rural areas and
telephone operators m ight be thrown
out of work by the installation of dial
or other automatic service and through
smaller exchanges going out of business
Said the commission Our experience
has been th a t rural subscribers
will not retain telephone service except
at very low rates relative to
urban rates and would not be willing
to pay the rates necessary to meet the
provisions of the act
 Rural telephone service ha been
seriously (Curtailed during the depression
and has failed to recover the
number of customers connected at the
peak of 1929 Nearly 35 percent of
the 1929 customers were disconnected
in 1934 At the end of 1937 there was
still 25 percent disconnected
There are about 750 telephone companies
in the state many of which arc
farm ers roadside lines which get exchange
service from other companies
If the requested exemption is granted
few er than 100 exchanges would come
under the act
L arger telephone companies would
not be particularly affected by the

Significance Since the President
and congress seem to be heading
down opposite paths the best guess
holds th at Mr Roosevelt is deliberately
inviting a split in D em ocratic
ranks leading to form ation of a
third party for 1940 But L abors
N onpartisan league (C I O) m ust
be a bulw ark of that party and the
anti-C I O slur contained in Judge
M usm annos rejection fails to jibe
with these plans Moreover most
debated presidential appointm ents
have been judicial practically valueless
from a political viewpoint
But party-sm ashing need follow no
definite course dam aged feelings
could easily be patched up in tim e
for a third party cam paign in 1940
or 1944

it clear this offer would be rejected
In addition to a 17000000 agreem

President C ardenas has ju st announced
two new b arter contracts
involving approxim ately 4000000-

The big point of the relief fight was
not the am ount of money it was
loss of face and prestige by the
P resident It ended the six y ears of
u tter confidence in his direction and
faith in his adm inistration so far as
spending is concerned
H ere is the way the issues look

power to cut the gold value of

Electric Industry on Spot
As to Delaying Prosperity
Thc electric industry will shortly
give a dem onstration of the truth or
falsity of the often m ade charg e that
its delayed spending has been one
of the most im portant factors in
holding bock prosperity Actually
of course investors in the electric
industry m ay w ait a little to see
if the logical steps which m ight be
expected to follow the purchase of
the Tennessee E lectric properties by
TVA are followed up For exam ple
to see if there will be som e assu rance
that the governm ent will not
extend its com petition to new areas
and to see if the governm ent will
tre a t fairly other units it buys to
avoid duplication and to avoid com petition
between public and private
operation
But no such problem confronts the
public It can take it for granted
th at peace is coming and will
spread The investor m ight wait
to be sure that the Tennessee deal
is not just a tra p for him But to
Ihe outsider it is unthinkable that
the adm inistration would have gone
so far as it did in the Tennessee
E lectric deal with Wendell L Willkie
if it did not intend to go further
and do w hatever wos necessa
ry to encourage utility spending
The point is th at if one assum es
th at the hate which has c h a ra c te rized
the adm inistration a treatm en t
of the electric industry previously
is still in efTect th ere would have
been no earthly reason to r paying
the Com m onw ealth and Southern so
m uch F or the plain fact is th at
TVA did not have to pay anything
like so m uch It could have acquired
the properties eventually at
aecond hand junk value the course
so consistently advocated by TVAs
chief backer in the house of representatives
John R ankin of Mississippi
T h t Suprem e court had Just
throw n out the m ain legal hope of
the privately owned utilities True
the high court has never held the
TVAs venture into the electric business
to be constitutional But it is
also true th at the utilities would have
been at their w its end to find som e
o ther method of getting the court to
pass on this question When a m ajority
of the high court held th at
the privately owned utilities could
not claim dam ages because none of
th eir franchises guaranteed them
against com petition the door was
ra th e r effectually closed
Sudden Change of Policy
Ordered From It hite House
TVA could have pressed on with
its strangling com petition with
ra te s which did not retu rn a yield
even on the p art of its cost which
w as not allocated to flood control or
navigation and free PWA g ran ts on
the local system s
The answ er is that th ere w as a
sudden change ol policy ordered
from the White House T here w as a
right-about face of the course which
David E L ilienthal had been pursuing
T here w as an u tter rejection
of the policies of George Norris
and John Rankin so far as tr e a tm
ent of the electric industry is concerned
The only rational explanation Is
th at the adm inistration w ants som ething
m ore im portant and that
som ething is not difficult to see
As a m a tte r of fact W E Douglas
chairm an of the S E C has been
telling the P resident for a long tim e
m ore than a y ear nowthat the
u tilities have been lagging at the
ra te of about a billion dollars a y ear
in their new spending It would
seem apparent th at the P resident
has decided to see if utility spending
dam m ed up for four y ears now
according to Douglas calculations
will not break the business log-jam
and revive prosperity in this country
If it works as som e friends of the
P resident see the future business
will boom from now until Novem ber
1940 the New Deal will go m arch ing
on for the four years to follow
If business continues bad for the
next 18 m onths a reactionary governm
ent m ay sit in Washington
Congress Coes Along W ith
President on Preparetlness
In actual appropriations for ships
and guns m unitions and planes and
training for preparedness generally
P resident Roosevelt will get all he
w ants from congress Capitol Hill
is m uch im pressed with the notion
th a t the su rest way to preserve
peace is to be so strong th a t it
would be folly for any foreign country
to d rag us into w ar
But congress does not see eye to
eye with the P resident on som e of
the purposes of increased national
defense spending It will not go
along with him tow ard possible
sanctions against aggressor nations
T here is trem endous sentim ent for
m inding our own business and not
giving even too m uch tongue-lashing
to the nations th a t are doing things
of which we cordially disapprove
T here is a strong m inority headed
by Key P ittm an  chairm an of the
senate foreign relations com m ittee
which is for strong econom ic action
against Japan Senator P ittm an is
convinced that this country could
punish Jap an for its action in closing
the door of Chinese trad e to this
country and could do so without
risk of provoking a w ar betw een J a pan
and the United States
T here is another strong m inority
which favors boycotting of G erm
any p artly because of G erm any s
treatm en t of the Jew s and p artly
because of her aggressions on Aus-
! tria  Czechoslovakia and her keeping
E urope constantly in a w ar
scare A m uch sm aller m inority
feels the sam e way tow ard Italy
J a p a n C u ts P u rch a ses o f
C o tto n F ro m U n ite d S ta te s
In the cotton growing sta te s there
is still deadly fear th at if the United
States should boycott Ja p a n s silk
the r ric e of cotton would drop out of
sight As a m atter of fact Jap an
has been cuttn g her purchases of
cotton from the United States and
increasing her purchases of this s ta ple
from Brazil and China But the
fear is still there
The great m ajority In congress
still has the slogan "K eep out of E ntangling
A lliances" and is also vigorously
against any overt word or
act which m ight force G erm any J a pan
or any o ther nation to pick up
Uncle S am s gauntlet P a rt of this
is honest reasoning on the p a rt of
the senatois ard representatives
them selves P a rt of it perhaps m ost
of It is from em phatic protests from
the folks back home
Instead of the reaction the White
House expected from the em phasis
on the necessity of protecting dem
ocracy so that religion would be
safe there is a trem endous fear
judgrg ly the m ail pouring in on
Capitnl Ilill th at the P resident m ay
by taki-g such a m ilitant attitude

act since state industrial commission
regulations which have been in effect
since 1128 are approximately those
in the federal act
Crowded Hearing Rooms
For the past two weeks hearing
rooms in the state capitol have been
more than jammed by Wisconsin citizens
interested in proposed legislation
Biggest attraction of the week were
the pension measures A bill to raise
pensions to 60 a month for all over
60 and a resolution to congress urging
support of the welfare act brought
more than 2500 old people to the state
house
The 1800 or more Townsend Club
members came to Madison to voice
approval on a resolution by Senator
(lettlem an and Assemblyman Westphal
and both of Milwaukee urging
the support of congress on the General
Welfare act Dr Truman Gordon
state Townsend leader asserted that
his followers were not in Madison to
ask for separate state pensions which j
would be a heavy burden on the Wis-j
consin taxpayer
Over in the south wing of the capi-j
tol where the 60 a month bill for all j
over 60 was heard the 700 listeners J
were told that under this bill which!
would be financed by a 3 percent tax j
on gross profits all receiving pension 
would have to give up their jobs)
Then too all of the 60 received would j
have to be spent within thirty days
It is estim ated that this bill would
cost about 50 million dollars annually1
Proponents of the bill saw in it a
chance to increase business within thej
tate by 50 million dollars and to cre-j
ate with it many jobs for the sta te s)
unemployed I
Barbers and Teachers Too
Barbers and teachers of Wisconsin
also had field days in Madison last |
week The barbers along with cosmeticians
cleaners and dyers and shoe i
rebuilders discussed pro and con the
m erits of the assembly trade practice
Mil A proposed measure by Assemblyman
Murray Tehan and Alfonsi j
would renew state codes after April lj
when the present law expires Ad-
m inistration would Ih placed under j
the departm ent of agriculture andj
m arkets
Code opponents charged that codes!
destroyed business initiative and effi-j
ciency created bootlegging conditions
in industry and barbers cutting hair
at home for cut rates and cut receipts
and volume of trade
Those favoring the bill said it
eliminated cut rates and long hours
raised wages and lightened relief!
rolls
Wisconsin teachers opposed a bill j
by Assemblyman Jam es which would
repeal the teachers tenure law passed
by the 1937 legislature Under that
law teachers cannot be discharged
after serving five yeers unless charges!
of inefficiency or misbehavior are
proven Those in favor of repeal
pointed out th at the present law has
resulted in the wholesale discharge of j
teachers who have served four years
while those opposing repeal of the law
asked th at the present law be given a 
chance to function and said th a t tenure
is necessary to a successful school |
system
C igarette Tax
C igarettes are the targ et of two
Ä¢ evenue seeking bills one before the
senate and one before the assembly
A bill in the senate by E rnest G
Sauld Democrat would levy a tax of
two per cent on each package of
cigarettes to raise money for relief
In the assembly a bill by A rthur j
Balzer Democrat would put a tax of I
2 cents a package on cigarettes for old j
age pension costs On cigarette |
papers a tax of one half cent would
be levied Retailers would be responsible
for payment of the tax and
would put tax stamps on packages before
they were sold

According to radiopinion if
George Washington were living now
hed be interested in Farm Cooperatives
because in his day he was a progressive
farm er Certain it is hed be
interested in some new developments
in agriculture which he would probably
find highly am using as wellcoming
from one of the largest countries in
the world For instance there is now
a herd of seven cows and one bull
which are midgets standing from 30-
37 inches high and weighing from 450
to 500 pounds There are full grown
turkeys which fit the average family
table and checkbook6 lbsand lots
of white meat Small watermelons
which will fit into the average refrigerator
and boasts an excellent flavor
and apple trees which are m ature
when they are ten feet high are other
midget products of the experimenter
I wonder if George Washington
wouldnt look around to see if science
had succeeded in developing a race of
Tom Thumbs and Thumbellinas to fit
the average American brain which has
already assumed dwarfed proportions
without the aid of the scientist

Discussed P a tte rn s
(By G ertrude M Hoffmann County
Home Demonstration Agent)
A study of how to fit the commercial
pattern to the individual proved
to be an interesting one to the leaders
of the Homemakers clubs in the Wittenberg
center this week The questions
When were women able to buy
a pattern to use in cutting out g a rm
ents How are patterns made and
"W hat size patterns shall I buy were
some of the questions discussed at the
meeting P atterns were cut from
muslin by the women and altered to
fit the individual It was generally
felt that a discussion of these problems
would be of help to the individual
in determ ining what needed to be done
in the altering of garm ents as well as
in the cutting of new garm ents
The meeting in the Wittenberg
I Center was held at the home of Mrs
Orlando Helgeson near Shepley

were Mrs H erbert Umland and Mrs

A NEW SERIAL
Although it is hardly possible to
class the new Weiss serial C usters
Last Stand in the category of westerns
or horse operas it is necessary
to note that it has besides its
full share of historic m erit all the
virtues of an exciting and hair-raising
Western In this connection too it
is extremely interesting to find that
th e public has become more and more
interested in stories of the West Not
alone have the motion pictures re corded
this new popularity but booksellers
everywhere are commenting on
the fact th at readers are demanding
W estern fiction The opening chapter
of C usters Last S tand will appear
on the screen at the Badger Theatre
next week and will continue for 15
weekson Tuesdays Wednesdays and
Thursdays

T iimik arc good reasons why
so many folks are talking about
the 1939 Ford V-8!
One obvious reason is tbe
fact that it provides so linn-h

it costs less than a Ford

power sold for last year! And
its low p rice includes many
items of desirable equipment

 Danger on the Rails
H e l l o  e v e r y b o d y !
I m still learn in g w hat a terrific beating the hum an m ind
and body can tak e an d still survive The latest one to im p ress
this lesson on m e is todays A dventurerP atrick J Laffey of
T renton New Je rse y  P a t Laffey as a boy in Ireland craw led
! under a locom otive and w as hanging to the u n d ercarriag e when
the engineer s ta rte d his train His description of the heavy steel
rods as they s ta rte d to m ove picking up speed shoving him 
b atterin g him well read the story!
P a t w as ju st as he puts it ÄòÄòa broth of a boy in 1915 living
in G alw ay Ireland On this p a rtic u la r autum n afternoon he
and two com panions se t out blackberrying So lovely w as the
scenery th a t they trav eled fa rth e r from home than they had
ev er before v en tu redsom e ten m iles
"W e dared go no fu rth e r" P a t says "le st we get lost in our hom ew
ard journey We w ere all tired now so we sta rted home bringing our
I collection of berries along
The bovs crossed a few fields when suddenly they cam e to
a double railroad tra c k  R ather than cross any more fences or
fall into any m ore ditches they sta rted home alone the track 
They had walked about half a mile when their attention was
attracted by a huge engine which lay on the sidetracks nearby
"T o m e P a t says "w ho had never seen one before this huge
m ass of steel presented one of lifes m y steries The boys w atched
the aged engineer as he pushed and pulled levers "How M at thuig did
whistle and sh riek " P a t recalls " I think I h ear it now
Mystified P a t Clim bs U nder the Locomotive
A little later the engineer left his position and walked down am ongst
j other c a rs on the track  The engine was still steam ing and hissing
"T h is" P a t says  w as our chance for a final analysis of our m y stery
w as this huge thing really alive?
The m ore they looked at it the m ore confused the boys becam e
They walked around it saw its d irty greasy iron bars its large
shiny wheels  And now " P at says "m y race with death occurred
I feel a cold shiver right down my spine now
 1 m yself se t the tra p for the grim Jaws of eternity It w as a
foolish a c t on my p a rt as I learned later Now boys dont get
a fainting spell when you read this but consider yourself in my
position W hat would you have done?
Well here is the incredible thing P a t did Being greatly
interested in the engine he exam ined it as best he could so did
his chum s R ather than m iss anything he crept underneath the
huge stru ctu re He w as Just in there when the engineer returned
He rebuked P a ts two chum s for their presence on the property of

C Houston Goudiss Helps to Answer the Question
What to Eat During Lent?
By C HOUSTON GOUDISS
A CLERGYMAN friend of m ine once rem ark ed th at in his
opinion Lent lasts fa r too long He had reference I believe
to the fact th a t in a sw ift-m oving age people m ight
be m ore ap t to keep L ent faithfully if it term in ated in a
sh o rter period than 40 days
Many hom em akers I feel sure would echo his sentim
ents but for a ra th e r different reason! N um bers of them  I
know find the six weeks of Lent the m ost troublesom e of the
en tire year T heir difficulty
lies in planning m eatless
m eals th a t satisfy h earty appetites
And since the w eathe
r is often bitterly cold in late
F e b ru a ry and early M arch
fam ilies usually seem hung
rie r and h a rd e r to satisfy
th an a t alm ost any other
season
A Chance for Variety
Lent does challenge the hom em
ak er to exercise im agination and
ingenuity Rut it al
so provides a golden
opportunity to get
out nf a m enu rut
if you happen to be
one of those people
who follow a set
form ula m ost of
the year It m ay
likewise offer a
c h a n c e to m a k e
som e s i g n i f i c a n t
savings in your food
budget
Most of us feel th at m eat m akes
the m eal And it cannot be de
nied that its savory extractives
give it a m ost appetizing and intriguing
flavor But there are a
n um ber of other foods which contain
proteins of equal biological
value Furtherm ore nutritionists
hold th at it is desirable to obtain
{ protein from a num ber of different
I sources That is because different
protein foods contain varying
am ounts of different am ino acids
and hy eating a variety of protein
foods we ra n best obtain a wide
assortm ent of these  building
stones of the body
For Meatless Meals
Fish com es to m ind first of all
j as a m ain dish for the m eal that
does not include m eat F or those
who are fa r from the source of
supply of fresh-caught fish there
j are the quick-frozen varieties the
| dried and salted fish such as finnan
haddie shredded codfish and
j block cod and 27 types of canned
| fish and shell fish
Canned salm on is one of the
I least expensive of all protein
! foods And so m any things can
I be said in its favor that one na-
| tionally known food authority re-
| ferred to it as the m ost nutritious
anim al food th a t could be had for
j children over six It is a notable
! source of m inerals especially cal-
| cium  phosphorus and iodine and
m any v arieties of ready-cooked
beans on the m ark et packed in
both glass and tin And dried
lim a beans a re particularly wellsuited
to being m ade into croquettes
p atties loaves chow ders
and ragouts
N uts a re another possibility for
Lenten m eals th a t should be considered
by every hom em aker
They too can be used for croquettes
and nut loaves as well
as souffles and casserole com binations
N uts can be com bined
with vegetables for a m ain-course
dish    with fruit for d essert
In the form of nut butters they
m ake a nourishing spread for
luncheon sandw iches
M oreover each type of nut has
a distinctive taste  and w alnuts
peanuts brazil nuts and pecans
for exam ple each m ake a thoroughly
delightful dish with a flavor
quite different from the
others
Most hom em akers will also w ant
to use eggs m ore frequently d u ring
Lent because they are so
readily available and easily prepared
This is com m endable because
besides Dont Overlook N ut and Legume DbeeinnKg aa nfi"neV s¬∞ouu"rce
Legum es are one group of vege- K  (o m " k
tables which are high in energy
values They also contain protein
as a protective food
Only a few of the m any possibilities
for Lent have been suggested
in this brief review But
surely they give a hint of the m any
good and nutritious foods a hom em
aker can choose on those days
when she plans m eatless m eals
