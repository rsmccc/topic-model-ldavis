FORTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN, THURSDAY, APRIL 6, 1939 NUMBER 21
Dairying Gets Attention
The Wisconsin dairy farmer and
the many problems now confronting
his industry captured the lion's share
of attention in the headlines and news
o f the week.
Butter and cheese prices are down
compared to a year ago. and while the
trend is alarming to the farmer the
average market price o f all dairy products
is still 50 per cent above the
1933 price which prompted the milk
strikes of that era.
Decreased consumption of milk has
resulted in the reduction of milk
prices in Milwaukee from 12 to 10
cents a quart. Similar reduction are
expected in other urban areas where
price control as set by the department
of agriculture and markets has been
in effect.
Two thousand farmers were expected
to meet in Madison the first of this
week to discuss a program for securing
federal assistance to stabilize
dairy prices.
In a frank prepared statement to
the agricultural committee of the assembly
Director Ralph Ammon of the
department of agriculture and markets
outlined his impressions of the
difficulties facing the cheese industry.
Prices Are Down
Following the cessation of butter
buying by the Dairy Products Marketing
Association, federal agency operating
under the A A A act of 1938,
butter prices have taken a slump.
Reports from the state and federal
crop reporting service show that on
the J5th of March farm butter was
listed at 27 cents per pound as com
pared to 35 cents a year ago and 29
cents February 1 of this year. Butter
fa t prices stand at 25 cents as com
pared to 31 cents a year ago and 26
cents per pound on February 1.
Cheese market prices likewise exhibit
a downward trend, w hin compared
to 1938 prices as shown by the following
table:
Feb. 1939 Feb. 1938
Swiss cheese 18c lb. 20.8c lb.
Brick cheese 11.1c lb. 12.8c lb
Limburger cheese 12.5c lb. 13.2c lb.
American cheese 11.8c lb. 14.6c lb.
Significance of the problem to the
Wisconsin farmer is shown by these
facts recently released from the state
department of agriculture and mar
kets.
Milk accounts for 50 per cent of the
farm income of Wisconsin which produces
10 billion pounds of milk annually,
11 per cent of the milk produced
in the nation.
Wisconsin produces h alf of the na
tion's cheese, 360 million pounds, and
ranks third in butter production with
170 million pounds.
One cent a hundred pounds of milk
means a million dollars a year to Wis
consin farmers. The average price of
100 pounds for the state is about 40
cents below that of a year ago, which
means 40 million dollars. One cent a
pound on the price of cheese at the
factory means 3 Vi million dollars. The
price this winter has run about four
cents below last winter, which means
a loss of 14 million dollars.
Retail Milk Prices
Retail milk prices in Milwaukee
were cut from 12 to 10 cents a quart.
Indications are that reductions will
also be made in prices jn Mndison,
Beloit, and other cities in the state.
A t public hearings in cities affected,
a few farmers have protested that
sales will not be increased enough
through the reductions to make up for
the price cuts, and that they will have
to bear the burden ofthe cuts instead
of the dealers and labor. In Milwaukee,
Ammon answered that the department
had no control over labor,
but that the dealers would have to
make some adjustment in their labor
and other costs or they would face
bankruptcy.
The reductions in Milwaukee cut
producer prices from $2.71 to $2.10
per hundred pounds. Ammon has said
that the reductions were made to halt
the downward trend in the consumption
of milk which has been m-esent
for the last six years. “The remiction
has been coming for a year,” he said.
“Now that we’ve made it, we don’t intend
to revoke it. I t ’s in the best interests
of the farmers, we believe/’
Farmers Map Program
About 2,000 farmers were expected
in Madison last Monday to formulate
plans and a program with which to
impress upon federal authorities and
congress the need of parity payments
for butter, and the continuation of
the buying of butter by the federal
Commodity Credit Corporation.
The meeting of W’isconsin farmers
followed a similar gathering of dairy
farmers of Minnesota who met on

McCarthy Elected
As Circuit Judge
Joseph R. McCarthy, Shawano attorney,
was elected circuit judge over
Edgar V. Weroer, Appleton, present
inqumbent. McCarthy won by a m ajority
of nearly 4,000 votes in Tuesday's
judicial election. He carried
Outagamie and Shawano counties, but
lost I*anglade county. He is the
youngest circuit judge ever to be
elected in this district.
McCarthy piled up a total vote of
15.160 in the three counties. Judge
Werner ran second with a total of
11,154, while A. N. Whiting received
a total of 9,071.
Shawano county gave McCarthy
4,561 votes, Werner 2,689 and Whiting
2.185. In Langlade county McCarthy
received 2,051, Werner 1,069 and
Whiting 4,534. In Outagamie county
McCarthy had 7,172 votes, W’erner
6.921 ani Whiting 2,214.
Mr. McCarthy got a little more
than 60 per cent of the judicial votes
cast in the city of Shawano.
The newly elected judge is 29 years
fid. He received his education at Marquette
after finishing a high school
course in one year. After his graduation
from law school he was connected
with a law firm in Milwaukee for a
short time, then came to Shawano and
was a member of the Eberlein law
firm for a few years. The first of the
year he established an office of his
own and had since then devoted his
full time to the campaign for circuit
judge.
Judge E. V. Werner, his predecessor,
will close a long and successful
career as circuit judge this coming
December 31. He will handle the May
and December terms of court before
relinquishing his position to Mr. McCarthy.
The Spring Promenade
The hours are drawing us closer to
the annual Spring Prom to be held at
the Wittenberg Gymnasium April
fourteenth.
A naturalistic setting of evergreens
and flowers will blend with glittering
raindrops to be suspended from the
ceiling, shimmering above the heads
of many couples dancing to Ted Gay’s
Orchestra.
One realistic feature that will lend
to the effectiveness of an April shower
will be a rainbow that will appear at
intervals during the evening.
The Prom King, Norman Johnson,
and Queen, Ardell Kersten* have
chosen the members of the Court of
Honor.
A t ten o’clock the ceremony of
crowning the queen will take place.
Farm House and Barn
Destroyed By Fire
Fire of undetermined origin desroyed
the house and bam on the Herman
Hoffman farm about a mile northeast
of Shepley. Mr. Hoffman was at
home alone, the others of the family
being away at church services, when
the fire broke out in the barn about
4:00 o’clock, destroying i t together
with a heifer calf and three tons of
hay.
Embers from the burning barn also
set fire to the house nearby which also
burned to the ground. Much of the
contents of the house was saved.
Mr. Hoffman carried insurance on
the buildings. He expects to start
soon on the work of rebuilding the
structures destroyed.
Fire Damages Roof
at the Orphan Home
A spark from a chimney ignited
the roof of the chapel and school
room wing of the Homme Orphan
Home Saturday morning at about
6:15. Fortunately it was discovered
at once by one of the boys in the yard.
In a few minutes the alarm was
sounded in Wittenberg and the village
fire department responded quickly.
By the joint efforts of employes of
the institution, which has a fire fighting
apparatus of its own, and of the
village fire department, the blaze was
soon under control without much
damage having been done outside of a
hole in the roof.
Wre are all very thankful that the
fire was quickly under control and
that the fine old building did not burn
to the ground, rendering the many
children there temporarily homeless.
Piano Recital Well Attended
To Village of Wittenberg Voters M l ’S. Walter Meyer
I wish hereby to express my hearty .
appreciation for the splendid support j
accorded to me by so many of you
voters in Tuesday’s election.
My best efforts at all times will be ’
to serve you well and faithfully in the

Communication
Dear Editor:
I note with interest that the Homme
Orphan Home received some frontpage
space in your issue of last week.
There is one thing which I would like
to point out. The farm land known as
the Indian Mission farm has been
operated by the Orphan Homo for
some time, but taxes have bctn paid
on that property this year a* well as
last year. There have been no additions
to the Orphan Home farm since
the exemption of taxes was originally
granted, some years ago.
Very truly yours,
K. L. Lokensgard, Manager,
Homme Orphan Home.

Congress Wins Economy Tussle
But Finds It Holds Hot Potato
------------------- B y J o s e p h W . L a B i n e —
E D IT O R 'S N O T E— When opinions are
expressed in these columns, they are those
ol the news analyst, and not necessarily
ol the newspaper.
Congress U. S. business was pouting genuinely
last February when Harry
Hopkins made his famous Des
Moines speech promising a new administration
effort to start the recovery
ball rolling. But to business
men, recovery was precluded by
high relief costs and “ exorbitant’*
taxes. When the administration indicated
unwillingness to slash costs,
Mr. Hopkms* highly touted "a p peasement”
plan bogged down and
in its place arose the most hostile,
economy minded congress President
Roosevelt has ever faced.
Many administration leaders, like
Secretary Morgenthau and Vice
President Garner, are economy
bent. Others, like Federal Reserve
Chairm an Marriner Eccles, a White
House favorite, believe government
should spend when industry will not,
providing a semblance of normalcy.
But so unpopular a philosophy bucks
the public trend, which is poor politics.
A smarter course is to give
congress and the nation its economy.
If prosperity results, the
White House will bask in glory; if
it misses fire, the public can be reminded
that the White House counseled
against it all along.
Whatever the reasoning, a sudden
twitch in administration attitude
has brought new peace to Washington:
Eccles Demarche. Appearing before
a special senate silver committee.
Mr. Eccles confounded his audience
by advocating governmental
economy. His reasoning: “ While I
am convinced that such a policy
. . . under present conditions would
have disastrous results, we live in
a democracy, and, therefore . .
the viewpoint of the majority should
promptly be made effective.” His
suggestion: That federal spending
be concentrated on non-competing
public activities, i.e., buildings,
roads, schools, hospitals, housing.
Morgenthau Demarche. Next day
Mr. Morgenthau gave administration
blessing to congressional plans
for postponing scheduled increases
in payroll contributions for social
security, also endorsing a pay-asyou-
go system founded on sound actuarial
principles. Present assessments
are 1 per cent each against
employer and employee. In 1940
and 1941 this would jum p to per
cent each; 2 per cent to 1945 ; 2*4
per cent to 1948; 3 per cent each
after 1948. Mr. Morgenthau’s four
alternatives:
(1) One per cent to 1940; l 1^ per
cent to 1943 ; 2 per cent to 1946; 2\k
pe’r cent to 1949; 3 per cent after
that.
(2) Boost from 1 to 1V» per cent
in 1940; to lVi per cent in 1941; to
1% per cent in 1942; present schedule
thereafter.
(3) Boost from 1 to 1V# per cent in
1940; to m per cent in 1941; to 1 Ms
per cent in 1942; present schedule
thereafter.
(4) O m it increase to 1*2 per cent
WHEN SOCIAL SECURITY COSTS WENT DOWN

before the house uays and means committee that a lim n e d o ld age reserve fun d

\ in 1940; step up rates in 1943 and follow
present schedule thereafter.
Morgenthau reasoning: The trend
of business conditions in specific future
years could not be accurately
foreseen in 1935 when social security
was started under the present $40,-
000,000,000 reserve plan. Today it
appears a $3,000,000,000 reserve
would be sound.
Also recommended was a trustee
board to hold social security funds,
thereby spiking criticism that the
money is now being used to pay
governmental expenditures. Under
actual operation, payroll contributions
now go to the treasury, are
shifted to the old-age reserve fund,
then invested in treasury securities
to bring the cash back to the gen-
I eral fund.
Sour Note. Given a highly cov-
1 eted concession, congress has found
I economy is easier to talk about than
| enforce. Next on the list is the
farm appropriations bill, carrying a
I $250,000,000 item for parity pay-
I ments which had not been included
in . the original budget estimate.
Farm-state representatives, foreseei
ing political suicide if parity ap-
I propriations were not made, hoped
j the money might come from a renewal
of processing taxes. Industrial-
state lawmakers knew their .
! constituents would object. And both
| groups reflected that less social security
income would leave Secretary
Morgenthau’s cupboard bare.
Europe
Almost forgotten in the heat of
European affairs was a prediction
that came true: That March would
be a crisis month. As March neared
its iamb-like end. Reichsfuehrer
Adolf Hitler and Premier Benito
Mussolini had indeed engineered a
crisis and Europe's democracies
were found wanting. The blunt fact:
For nine days after Germany's
Czech conquest, Prance, Britain,
Russia and Poland sought unsuccessfully
for solidarity while Hitler
m ade hay in Slovakia, Memel, Lithuania,
Belgium and R um an ia . The
aftermath: Mussolini found courage
to cry openly (for the flrst time) for
French concessions. By the month’s
end it appeared flowers would bloom
this April in Europe, for only the
remote possibility of French anti-
Ita lia n action could m ar an otherwise
complete Nazi-Fascist victory:
Germany. O f minor importance
to jittery London and France are
new German treaties handcuffing
Slovakia and Lithuania. Of greater
interest is the barter treaty with
Belgium, an inroad that strikes close
to home. But most important is
ths pact Hitler shoved down the
throat of R u m a n ia ’s King Carol. Its
gist: About 90 per cent of C arol’s
farm products, and most of his
9,000,000-ton annual oil production
go to G erm any; R um an ia is brought
politically, m ilitarily and economically
into the Reich’s orbit by concessions
unprecedented in modern
economic relations between two sovereign
nations. With Hitler appar-N
ently headed eastward, R um an ia offers
an excellent Trojan horse for
penetration of the Russian Ukraine.
But increasingly remembered is the
fact that another empire-bound tvarnor,
Napoleon, met his match in
Russia.
Spain. By late March the 32-
month civil war had apparently run
its full course, ready to end with a
Nationalist victory, to be followed
by German-Italian domination.

WASHINGTON —Action of the adm
inistration in putting higher duties
against Germ an products, curiously
enough, makes just that
much more difficult the underlying
scheme for giving the Reich fierce
competition in the South American
markets, one important step toward
which was taken during the recent
visit to Washington of Oswaldo A ranha,
B razil’s foreign minister.
Perhaps the best way to illustrate
it is to cite the case of R um an ia ,
prior to the present threat against
her political integrity. R um an ia produces
wheat and oil in abundance,
though not as much of either as
Germ any needs. Germany is eager
to take these products, and has been
taking them, paying in aski marks,
m eaning that R um an ia had to take
her pay in products bought inside
Germany.
Why aski marks? The answer to
that is the answer to m an y other
questions involving Germany, and
which will continue to be perplexing
unless Germany obtains the
Ukraine, some of her former colonies,
and perhaps some other territory.
Only when Germany is economically
sufficient within herself—
is able to supply all her needs from
her own territory—will the need for
aski marks, or something to accomplish
the same results, be ended.
If world trade were norm al today
this would not be true. Germ any
demonstrated, before the outbreak
of the World war, that she was
very efficient at selling her goods
abroad. Today her workers are so
underpaid and worked such long
hours that she would prove an im possible
competitor in m an ufactured
goods with Britain, and of
course the United States.
Many Quota Restrictions
As Well as Higher Tariffs
But world trade conditions are not
norm al. There are all sorts of quota
restrictions as well as tariff duties
far beyond anything known before
the World war. On top of this there
has been another growing menace
to Germ an exports— the Hull reciprocal
trade agreements. For example,
when the United States made
its trade agreement with Czechoslovakia
some time back, the substantial
reductions of duties therein
applied to every other nation in the
world except those not on the ‘‘most
favored nation” list. Under the new
agreements with B ritain and Canada,
this differential against Germany
was magnified, for Germ any
is not on the list.
The result of this trade barrier
eliminating program of Cordell Hull,
therefore, has been to gradually
tighten a strangling grip on Germany's
economic throat. Aski
marks is one of the devices to meet
this threat Germ any wants coffee
and cotton from Brazil. Brazil wants
a number of products which Germ
any can supply, but which she
m igh t buy equally well from the
United States or Britain. But the
United States cannot increase to any
extent her consumption of Brazilian
coffee, and does not want any of
her cotton. So aski marks force
Brazil to do that particular buying
in Germany.
The complication of the problem
ju st produced by the United States
action in boosting the duties on Germ
an products is that the German
products which have been finding a
market in the United States must
obviously go elsewhere if Germany
is to continue getting the imports
which those particular exports have
been buying. So she will be forced
to redouble her efforts to force them
on Latin America.
President If ants Potver to
Direct Our Foreign Policy
A real battle over the neutrality
legislation, with both the President
and the extreme isolationists wanting
to amend the present law in
highly conflicting ways, looms on
Capitol Hill.
‘‘Der Tag'' still waits around the
corner. It didn’t happen this time.
Ethiopia, Spam, Austria, Munich
and finally the dissolution of Czechoslovakia,
each made its crisis, but
each passed, leaving each time a
little more fear, a little more certainty,
that war was coming. Each,
while scaring the world to death, revives
all the old issues and bitterness
which were fought over when
the original neutrality law was enacted
two years ago— isolation versus
collective security—trade versus
neutrality—national pride versus
international peace.
The present act satisfies no one
of the special groups and interests
involved. A strong minority in congress
feels that it gives the President
too much power in leaving to
j his discretion the declaration of a
I state of war, which declaration determines
whether the embargoes
and other restrictions become effective,
and when.
President Roosevelt maintains the
present law ties his hands too closely,
thinks he should have the power
to pick and choose between belligerents,
to embargo a commodity to
one fighting nation and not to the
other, to have power to determine
what articles shall be classified as
“ war supplies.” In short—power to
settle our whole foreign policy.
The policy of the administration,
and of the state department, since
1914 for that m atter, regardless of
the political label of the occupant
of the White House, has been that
United States interests are closely
akin to those of B ritain and France.
The President feels keenly that this
country’s dangers are increased in
almost direct ratio as the dangers
of the two big western Europe democracies
become more menacing.
This is a long range view held by
m any Americans.
Intelligent Solution of
Problem 18 Not Expected
But—congress will not go along
with the President on this. It will
not importantly increase his discretion
in neutrality administration.
The little group led by Senators Bennett
C ham p Clark and Gerald Nye,
that wants to deprive h im of all discretion,
will not make any gains.
But neither will the larger group
which believes the best interests of
the country can be served only by
allowing more discretion to the
White House. Too many members
of congress are convinced that discretionary
decisions after the outbreak
of a war in Europe must involve
side-taking, hence may involve
the United States in the conflict.
It is argued in defense of discretion
for the President that a m andatory
law embargoing shipments
to belligerents with an even hand
is anything but neutral, works gross
injustice. As in Spain against the
loyalists.
Anything can come out of the neutrality
situation on Capitol H ill.
Washington Stag Dinners
Generally Misunderstood
Few things in Washington are so
generally misunderstood as some of
the big stag dinners which occur at
regular intervals—four of them annually,
and one twice a year.
F or instance the annual ‘‘wallow”
of the M ilitary Order of the Carabao.
The average citizen would
never have heard about these ‘‘wallow's”
if it had not been for William
Jennings Bryan. When the
Commoner was secretary of state
he discovered that a line in one of
the songs which the Carabao were
to sing at their dinner read: “ Civilize
them with a K ra g ,” meaning
of course the rifle which was regular
arm y equipment during the Philip
p in e insurrection.
This gave the country the notion,
one it still entertains when it thinks
about the Carabao at all, that the
members are a bunch of fire-eaters
who would like to apply Japanese
conquest methods in the islands. Actually
the only thing on which the
organization seems to be agreed is
that the islands its members fought
to hold should be retained indefinitely
by the United States. That is
not an unnatural attitude for men
who have passed the prime of life,
and are looking backward at the
days of their youth and effort. Naturally
they do not want that big experience
in their lives to count for
nothing, and that is the way they
would feel if the United States
should, as they put it, “ scuttle” in
the Philippines.
Actually, however, General Aguinaldo
has been an honored guest at
these “ wallows,” and so have other
insurrecto leaders. More of the blue
and gray spirit of Civil war reunions
prevades the wallows than any
thought of bitterness.
For the last 20 years not a word
has been said or sung at a Carabao
wallow that would not have
been approved at the White House,
the state department, or the lobbies
of the Philippine congress. The dinners
have been more like college
class reunions than anything else.
Correspondents' Dinners
Glorified Vaudeville Shows
The White House Correspondents’
dinners have become glorified
vaudeville shows, with the added
eclat for visitors that the President
of the United States and most of the
cabinet ard always present. Actually
98 per cent of the entertainment
is provided by professionals, usually
provided by the two big broadcasting
companies on alternate years.
The President merely acknowledges
the friendly greeting. This year this
enjoyable and relaxing event had to
be cancelled because of the hotel
strike, affecting all the hotels with
dining rooms large enough to accommodate
the number scheduled.
The National Press club dinners
are but a slight modification of the
White House correspondents’, save
that the dinners are smaller, being
limited by the fact that it is held in
the Press club auditorium. There
is usually a little more am ateur talent,
but the real load of providing
amusement rests on professionals.
The Gridiron dinners are utterly
different in that there is no professional
talent whatever except the
musicians. The skits are performed
by amateurs and are written by
newspaper men who are members.
The whole punch of a Gridirion d inner
is to see the President and high
officials kidded to their faces, this
being one of the few countries where
this would be possible.

“ Bert wasn’t in a condition to say
m uch about anything,” Hale reminded
Ainsworth. "B u t you must
have seen what was going on,” he
added. "Y o u 're not the m an to miss
anything like that.” Then, looking
at Ainsworth’s lolling figure, his
sleekness, his air of well-being, and
his Cheshire Cat grin, Hale suddenly
lost his temper. "W h at I shall never
be able to understand," he
brought out between his teeth, “ is
why you and Mrs. Spencer Forbes,

“ I suppose so, in a way,” Ainsworth
drawled. “ I knew he was

“ A ll rig h t," he said. “ We’ll let it

I got Craig out. That’s all

“ Oh, come now,” Ainsworth was
smiling tolerantly. "D o n 't hold out

did it. I'm immensely interested."
Rex had called his temper to heel
and it obeyed him .
" I can do that in one sentence,"
he smiled. “ I told several distinguished
psychiatrists what was going
on, and found out from them
how to stop it.”
Ainsworth whistled softly.
“ You mean you actually gave
C raig 's name to his colleagues, and
threatened to have him kicked out
of medicine?”
“ That’s the general idea. I can’t

Ainsworth's face had grown serious.
There was a silence which

“ You certainly went to it. Big

"Thanks. I ’m glad you’re im pressed.

to stop them .”
“ We? Who do you mean by ‘we’? ”
Ainsworth almost purred the words.
“ By ‘we’ I mean your host, Casper
Kneeland,” Hole told him cheerfully,
"a n d myself. Don't cherish
the notion that I'm butting in where
I have no right to be. I ’m Mr.
Kneeland’s employee, and my principal
job was to get rid of the parasites
and adventurers who are abusing
his hospitality. I've done part of
that job. Now I intend to finish it.
"Y o u see, Ainsworth,” he went on
conversationally, as the other remained
silent, "y ou ’re not dealing
now with a middle-aged and tired
m an you think you’ve got a clutch
on. You're dealing with a m an your
own age who knows a whole lot
m o te about you than you think he
does. That's quite a different m atter.”
“ You won’t find me as easy to get
rid of as Craig was,” Ainsworth returned
coolly. “ In fact, m y interfering
friend, I ’m serving notice on
you again that I ’m staying here all
lu m m e r ."
Rex shook his head.
“ You’re m istak e n," he said gravely.
" Y o u ’re leaving, Ainsworth, and
you’re leaving almost at once.
Vou’re going to be out of here by
tomorrow night. W hat’s more,
you're going to leave prettily and
politely, like a little gentleman.
You're going to do it with a smile.”
Ainsworth had laid dow nhis cigarette.
“ I know you're up against it, Ainsworth,”
Rex went on. "I'v e been going
into your record. But your misfortunes
are no excuse for the things
you’re doing. We’re all up against
it more or less, these days. But
we don’t all go in for a combination
ol extortion and saddism as you are
doing.”
"B y God, there’s a lim it to what
T il take from you,” Ainsworth said
fjrio u sly . His self-control had
•napped. Rex was glad of it. In
cne way Ainsworth angry would be
tasie r to handle than Ainsworth
calm .
“ There may be,” he said quietly.
"B u t it hasn’t been reached yet.
I'v e got a lot of things to say ^ o
rou, and if you're wise you will
rep quiet and listen to them. They
t r e of vital interest to you. The
h is t is this. You think you have
Kneeland in your power. Tha* may
or m ay not be partly true. But
there’s one thing th a t'i dead certain.
I'v e got you by the short
hairs. I can make you dance to any
tune I play. When I remember
what you’ve been doing to poor
Kneeland I ’m tempted to play a
tune that will give you a nasty
dose of your own medicine."
Ainsworth yawned. He had pulled
himself together again, and Rex admired
his self-control.
“ I don’t want to seem rude to a
guest," he said. “ But you make
me terribly tired.
“That's nothing to the fatigue
you're going to feel a few minutes
from now," Hale prophesied. "T hat
will be exhausting."
“ I can easily believe you. All
right, get on with your story. To
be candid I want to go to bed."
“That desire, too, will grow as I
proceed. I'll get on with my story
all right. I 'll mention in passing
that it will be an unpleasant one.”
“ Go to it, go to it,” Ainsworth
urged wearily.
“ If it hadn’t been for some little
things that happened up in my
room,” Hale went on smoothly, “ I ’d
have let you off this interview pretcalling
his attention to some of hia
goings on,” Hale mentioned in passing.
"H e changed his mind. I think
you will. I ’ll get on faster if you
don't interrupt.”
" I f there's anything that will
make you get on faster. Hale, I'm
for it.”
Ainsworth was smiling now. He
lay back in his chair, relaxed and
comfortable, one leg thrown easily
over the arm of the chair, his head
resting against the padded chintz
back.
"B e comfy while you can,” Hale
commended. “ You’re in for a jolt
pretty soon. As I was saying,” he
went on, “ you wrote your silly
threatening notes and you drew
your silly coliras and other sketches
and left them on m y desk. They
didn't disturb me in the least, but
I was enough interested to have
them fingerprinted and get your fingerprints
for comparison. You may
remember that you tore a page out
of your note-book in the medical
library one morning, and handed it
to me. That was kind of you, because
I hadn’t been able to get your
fingerprints before. The fingerprints
on that page were perfect. The
“Bat yoa make
ty easily. I ’d have offered myself
as an intermediary between you and
Kneeland and tried to fix up a settlement
that would have been fair to
you both.”
“ Then you adm it that 1 have a
just c la im ,” Ainsworth asked coldly.
"W e ll, you’d better. I f you
knew what m y mother went through
while that fat white worm that calls
itself Casper Kneeland was battening
on her brother's invention, you'd
understand why I've made him
dance.”
“ That m ay all be true,” Rex admitted.
“ I don't know anything
about it except what Mr. Kneeland
has told me. I ’d have gone into
the whole matter, got the best legal
advice, and tried to make an
im pa rtia l settlement. I ’d have done
this as a matter of service to you
both. But, of course, I immediately
discovered what you were up to.
“ It wasn't a diversion worthy of
a gentleman of your ancestry," Hale
added smoothly. “ It wasn’t a nice
memorial to your mother. It was
a nasty game. Doctors have an unpleasant
name for it. It was a stupid
game, too,” he continued
thoughtfully. “ If that sort of thing
is being done it ought to be done
in private, not in the presence of a
gallery of spectators. You forgot
that, which was foolish of you. Or
if you remembered it. you underestimated
your audience. You
thought they were all either as callous
as yourself, or too self-absorbed
to take in what you were
doing. But they took it in.”
"M y God, Hale, what a freshet of
words you can send fo rth !” Ainsworth
yawned again. " I suppose it’s
less trouble to listen than to talk, so
proceed if you m ust.”
"Thanks. I promise you won’t be
bored.” Hale stopped long enough to
light another cigarette.
“ That was the situation when I
came here,” he repeated. “ I caught
on at once to what you were doing
and you saw that I did. In fact,
you had foreseen that I would do
so. You had made some plans in
advance. They were queer little
plans. They were the sort that
would only appeal to a mind like
yours. Your mental make-up being
what it is, you enjoyed carrying
them out. You did n 't want me here,
so you undertook to get rid of me
by m aking me uncomfortable. On
the face of it you seemed trying to
frighten me off. Of course you realized
that such kindergarten methods
wouldn't do that. What you had in
mind was to make it so unpleasant
for me that I'd leave voluntarily.
So you wrote your silly little threatening
notes—”
"W h at do these ravings mean.
Hale? Are you out of your m in d ? ”
"C raig thought I was when I was
terribly tired.”
fingerprints on the notes and
sketches were identical with them.
Fingerprinting is an exact science
now, you know. I ’ve learned a lot
about it lately. I had the work done
by a New York expert and he was
very inform ative."
Ainsworth had stopped smoking.
He took the cigarette out of his
mouth and looked at it thoughtfully.
Then he put it back.
“ I did have a little fun with you,”
he said calmly. “ I enjoyed thinking
up those stunts and putting
them over. What of it? It was nothing
more than we did at college."
“ At prep school, you m ean,” Rex
corrected gently. “ It represented
about the prep school stage of mental
development. You went a few
steps further when you put the dead
cat in my room. Of course I couldn’t
have poor Daisy fingerprinted, so
I went up to C ra ig ’s laboratory and
choked him for it. Up till then, you
see, I thought he was the m an that
poisoned animals around here. I
was also giving h im credit for the
notes and sketches and the wasps
and all the other things. However,
when I had his fingerprints made
they vindicated him. He also convinctd
me that he had nothing to.
do with the cat. Then I realized
that poisoning pet anim als was in
your line. It was right up your alley,
in fact. But I d idn’t regret the
choking I gave Craig. Ho had
earned that on the other counts."
“ Hale, you’re actually beginning
to interest m e.” Ainsworth was
leaning forward, his cigarette out,
his face almost alive.
“ But it may surprise you to know
that I never poisoned that c a t,"
he said.
“ You're telling me that?”
“ Yes, I ’m telling you that. I don’t
care a damn whether you believe it
or not. But as a matter of fact I
didn't kill the cat.”
“ If you didn’t, and Craig d idn’t,
who d id ?”
“ How should I know? But it’s an
interesting point.”
It was such an interesting point
that they both sat silent for a moment
considering it. Then Ainsworth
amplified his defense.
“ I found the cat, dead, lying back
of the big tent at the entrance to
the woods,” he explained. " I t was
Monday night. You had gone to
New York. I picked it up and carried
it to your room as a little surprise
for you when you got back.
The next day I saw it at the foot of
the third floor staircase. I thought
you had thrown it there. I picked
it up and got it out of the house to
the place where I had found it.
That's all I had to do with the m atter.
I don’t kill an im als."
Ainsworth got up ’ Good night,
Hale. Better luck next time you go
hunting.”
Hale kept his seat.
"O h, I ’m not going yet.” he said
cheerfully. " I ’ve got a lot more to
say. I ’m going to be so interesting
from now on that when I finally
stop you'll be begging me to stay.”
"That calls for some im agination."
But Ainsworth's eyes were
watchful again. He sat down with
a shrug and lit a fresh cigarette.
"Y o u 're quite right in saying that
I wouldn’t have anything on you in
the matter of the little nuisances
you’ve been com m itting ," Hale admitted.
“ But, you see, you finished
by nearly murdering me. That is
something else ag a in."
“ Any tim e you get around to explaining
what you're trying to
say—” Ainsworth murmured.
“ I'm trying to say that you nearly
murdered me,” Hale repeated
patiently. " I ’m telling you that
when you put that powerful emetic
in m y water carafe, and I drank the
entire glassful, it was touch and go
for an hour whether I ’d come
through it."
“ What rot are you talking now?”
Ainsworth jerked out. His expression
had changed and his watchful
eyes never left his companion's
face.
" I ’ll assume that you did n 't mean
to kill m e ," Hale said soberly, “ any
more than you meant to injure me
when you printed those anonymous
letters. All you meant to do was to
make me horribly sick. But you
gave me a terrific dose—about four
times the usual amount. As it h ap pened,
you gave that dose to a man
who only a month before had gone
through a life-and-death tussle with
pneumonia That pneumonia temporarily
weakened my heart. If I
hadn’t had some brandy where I
could reach it instantly," Hale ended
very deliberately, “ I ’d be in my
grave tonight and you would be
facing a trial for murder. All the
evidence is on file against you—
the threatening letters, the snake
sketch, the tombstone, the skulls,
the analysis of the doped water, the
fingerprints on the carafe, the statement
of the doctor I consulted next
day as to the condition of my heart
and the effects of such a dose on
such a heart. Do you imagine the
law would have accepted your explanation
that it was all a friendly
little joke? Think that over, Ainsworth.
Then laugh it off, if you
can.”

O ld Indian Mission Near Quebec Still
Uses Ancient Silver and Gold Present*
In the Indian village of Loretteville,
nine miles west of Quebec, is
a treasure which Louis X IV of
France and his mother, Anne of
Austria, sent to a poor Indian m ission
300 years ago, relates a writer
in “ So You’re Going.”
Indian Lorette, as they call it in
Quebec, is a tiny village where most
of the population are Huron Indians.
On the one street, h alf way through
the town, is an old church, no
larger than a good-sized barn, and
seating only about a hundred people.
Back of the church and connected
with it by a wooden entryway,
is a house—the tiny frame
house of the village priest, where
the treasure is kept in a brick vault,
specially built for the purpose, with
double iron doors. No one not known
to the priest or brought by h ii
friends is allowed to see it.
At the back of the tiny vault
stands a glass cabinet with four
shelves of silver and gold plate; tall,
richly chased candlesticks, and
wine and water cruets, and tremendous
spoons of silver which Louis
X IV himself sent. There is a jewelstudded
gold osU*nsoit sent by the
city of Paris in 1664, and there are
two splendid cases containing relics
of 11 saints sent by the city of
Chartres in the same year. In a
drawer beneath the c abinet are four
pieces of the chasuble embroidered
in the most elaborate patterns and
fine stitches, by ladies-in-walting of
King Louis’ court.
When the humble priest of the village
of Lorette puts on the robes
sent by Anne of Austria, sets the
altar of this tiny church with the
silver of King Louis X IV , and takes
the golden ostensoit in his hands,
there probably is no church on this
continent more splendidly served.
Having "A Screw Loose"
The expression “ a screw loose’*
is defined as "something wrong in
the condition of things" or " a dangerous
weakness in some arrangem
e nt" and according to the Oxford
English dictionary the phrase had
this sense at least since 1810. Later
it was used in the sense of "something
wrong with a person’s credit
or reputation" and "a rift between
two persons." A derived meaning,
the most usual, is "slightly crazy."
A Frontier Paul Revere
I AM E S WATSON WEBB was the
** famous editor ol the New York
Courier and Enquirer who also had
a career as a politician and diplomat.
But he deserves more honor
for a daring exploit which he performed
as a young man on the Illinois
frontier. The scion of an old
New York fam ily, Webb ran away
from home at the age of 17 and went
to Washington where he persuaded
John C. Calhoun, secretary cf war,
to give him a commission in the
army.
In October, 1821, young Lieutenant
Wehb was sent to join the garrison
at Fort Dearborn. In the m iddle
of the winter John ICinzie, the
Indian agent at Chicago, reported
to the commander that the Sioux
and Foxe Indians were plotting to
surprise and massacre the garrison
at Fort Snelling the next spring.
Colonel McNeil immediately
called for volunteers to carry the
news of the plot to Fort Armstrong
(near Rock Island, ID.) so that word
could be sent up the river to Fort
Snelling. Lieut. Webb offered to
make the journey. Accompanied by
a sergeant and a Pottawatomie
'(•guide, he set out early in February.
He intended to go first to the
post of a French trader on the
! Rock river and there secure a Winnebago
guide But when he reached
I the post he found the Winnebagoes
j holding war dances. So Webb and
i the?* sergeant cautiously circled
around the camp and headed
, toward Fort Armstrong
The weather was bitterly cold and
I the two men faced the danger of
! perishing in the raging blizzard. But
■ in spite of this they reached Fort
j Armstrong in safety. As a result of
| their trip, the commander at Fort
! Snelling so reinforced his post that
I the Indians did not dare attack and
a possible massacre was averted.

A Safety-Minded
Adventurer
T * H E Colorado river was referred
M o as a "mysterious monster"
until Maj. J. W. Powell made the
first authentic survey of its canyons
in 1869. It lured many daring adventurers
to their death both before
and after his first expedition.
Strangely enough, Powell was a
scholar and not an adventurer by
purpose. Even when he made his
successful journey down the river,
it was his methodical preciseness
rather than engineering or navigating
ability that brought success.
The Colorado descends an average
of more than eight feet each mile
and makes this drop by a series of
rapids. It rages through canyons
with perpendicular walls that often
tower several thousand feet.
Powell never ran into anything
dangerous when he could avoid it.
Being a geologist and not a navigator,
he beached his boat and sent
men along the cataract walls to reconnoiter
the rapids ahead before
he attempted to descend them. Powe
ll’s methods were so successful
that he is one of only a few who
ever made expeditions down the Colorado
without losing a single life.
He traveled the Colorado from the
Green river in Wyoming to Virgin
canyon below the Grand canyon,
bringing back the flrst authentic information
about that natural wonder.
Although he was a professor of
' geology at Illinois Wesleyan university
und had had no navigating exi
perience before his first venture, he
i designed boats that became models
for Colorado river work.
Major Powell was a paradox—a
cautious man whose motto was
"safety first" and yet he was one of
America’s greatest adventurers.

‘K ing’ Strang
I N 1847 Jam e s Jesse Strang—and
* the first two names are in the
proper order!—led a colony from
Voree, near LaCrosse, Wis., to the
Beaver islands just west of Traverse
bay in Lower Michigan. There
he set up a "k in g d om " over which
he ruled with an iron hand. He
was a picturesque figure with his
flaming whiskers almost as red as
the kingly robe he wore
Not oniy am he dispense his own
cruel brand of justice to the people
in his colony but he constantly made
1 war on the Irish fishermen on the
mainland and often pillaged their
; homes Finally he became so bold
that President Fillmore issued a
warrant for his arrest on a charge
: of treason for setting up an inde-
| pendent government within the Unit- !
ed States For some unknown reason
he was not found guilty and returned
to his "k in g d om ."
But his downfall was not long in
coming. He made a law that all
women were to wear short skirts
with baggy bloomers. When Mrs.
Thomas Bedford refused, her husband
was Hogged for upholding her
refusal. This was a fatal mistake.
For Bedford and another man who
had been flogged at the same time,
waylaid their hated monarch and
shot him. He was taken back to die
I of his wounds at Vorce and the peo- 1
j pie of his "k in g d om " were driven
I away from their island by the in-
I habitants of the Michigan mainland, j

(Run-over from first page.)
Friday in St. Paul. Minnesota dairy
farmers .presented the following program:
1. Secure the same federal recognition
for the dairy industry that is
given the cotton, corn and tobacco industries,
by making dairy products «
basic commodity.
2. Stabilize production of milk to
conform to demand.
Increase consumption of milk and
dairy products through advertising
and sales.
4. Continue the program of diseased
cattle eradication.
5. Continue the federal butter buying
program in reasons of highest
production.
Cheese Difficulties
The cheese industry faces three big
difficulties which are contributing to
keeping farm income down, Ralph
Ammon, director of the state depart-j
ment of agriculture and markets, has
informed the assembly committee on
agriculture in answer to a request for
a report on the “cheese situation.'*
The difficulties: 1. Failure to develop
a handy and attractive package]
for natural cheese. 2. Tendency
toward monopolistic control of thc
distribution of cheese. 3. Lack of
organization in the production end of
the industry.
Natural cheese is at a disadvantage
he said, because it is not put up in an
attractive, handy package, but must
be handled by merchants in the large,
unwieldy longhorns, daisies, wheels, j
and blocks. Because there is so much j
waste in such marketing Ammon said
many merchants refuse to handle |
natural cheese, and have placed thej
package problem as the number one
necessity of the industry.
Competitive buying from factories
is disappearing, Ammon told the com- j
mittee, About 75 per cent of the!
cheese is now bought by large con-]
cerns, thus a factory must continue to
sell to one buyer because others will j
not bid.
Lack of organization among producers
contributes to the other two
difficulties, he said. Of the 1,925'
cheese factories in the state not more!
than 80 are cooperating in one sale^
agency, less than 400 belong to a state I
organization. As a result, unfair competition
between factories for milk results.
The first two difficulties should be
solved by the government, said Am-j
mon, while the solution of the third !
lies with the industry.
Legislative Kece«*
Legislators are back home this week,
a brief one-week recess over election
lay and Easter. They will be back in
Madison on Monday, April 10, where
more than 700 bills await action.
During the week the senate:
1. Concurred in the assembly bill
which redefines labor disputes and
thus sent the measure on to the-Governor
which he promptly signed. Under
the new law a labor strike exists only
when a majority number of employes
in a collective bai gaining unit disagree
with employer. Stranger and secondary
picketing are thus outlawed. Labor
leaders state that this law will set I
labor back 20 years.
2. Confirmed the appointment o f ;
Mrs. Lila Burton to the board of con-j
trol.
3. Advanced to passage another,
trading stamp bill which would bar all I
-tamps with the sale of gasoline at \
filling stations.
4. Engrossed a bill setting up a new
securities division under a director to
be named by the governor.
5. Passed a bill permitting counties i
to set up civil service systems if they
no desire.
Code Law in Doubt
Failure of the legislature to reenact
the trade practice law which expired
April 1 leaves barbers, cosmeticians,
shoe repairers, and dry cleaners i
and dyers without a code this week.
The assembly refused to hurry a
bill sponsored by Assemblymen Tehen.;
Murray and Alfonsi. which would have
created a code authority in the depart- ■
ment of agriculture and markets under j
the fair trades law. More than that,,
the attitude of a slim majority in the!
assembly presents the doubt that any
code bill will be enacted at all. Republican
leaders, firm in their stand
against government interference in
business, believe that price regulation
by government is a transgression of
that principle.
The assembly has already adopted
t«» the code bill an amendment which
bars price fixing anil literally emasculates
the proposed measure
During the week the assembly also:
1. Defeated a measure intended
to set up a chiropractic ward in the
utate Winnebago hospital.
2. Passed a bill limiting the number
of taverns to one for each 500 of
population.
3. Concurred with the senate resolu-1
tion calling for a referendum vote on j
the diversion of highway funds. The
resolution must also be adopted by
the 1941 legislature before it can be
submitted to the people for vote.
4. Passed and sent on to the senate
the Hipke, Nelson, Hansen state highway
road aid bill which seeks to increase
local aids by 30 per cent.

O C R DUTY
The great world’s hqpu*t is aching
fiercely in the night.
And only God alone can heal it, and
God give lifh t.
And the men to bear that message, !
and to speak the living Word,
Are you and I. my brothers, and the i
millions that have heard.
Can we close our eyes to duty? Can
we fold our hands at ease,
While the gates of night stand open
to the pathways of the seas ?
Can we shut up our compassions?
Can we leave one prayer unsaid,
Till the lands which Hell has blasted
have heen quickened from the
dead?
We growl among trifles and our
spirits fret and toss
While above us burns the vision of
the Christ upon the Cross;
And the blood of God is streaming
from His broken hands and side.
And the lips of God are saying:
“Tell my brother I have died.”
O Voice of God, we hear Thee above
the shocks of time.
Thine echoes roll around us, and
the message is sublime;
No power of man shall thwart us,
no stronghold shall dismay,
When God commands obedience and
love has led the way.

Friendless and faint, with martyred
steps and slow;
Faint for the flesh but for the spirit
free,
Stung by the mob that came to see
the show.
The Master toiled along to Calvary.
We jibed Him as He went with
houndish glee.
Till His dimmed eyes for us did
overflow;
We cursed His vengeless hands
thrice wretchedly—
And this was nineteen hundred
years ago.
Rut after nineteen hundred years
the shame
Still clings and* we have not made
good the loss
That outraged faith has entered in
His name,
j Ah, when shall com* love’s courage
to be strong?
Tell me, O Lord — tell me, O Lord,
how long
Are we to keep Christ writhing on
the cross?

By C. HOUSTON GOUDISS
A GENERATION ago, homemakers approached the problem
of feeding their families with but two objectives:
to put weight on their children and to send adults away from
the table with their appetites appeased. If the child failed
to gain satisfactorily, or if his teeth were crowded and subject
to decay, he was said to “ take after his Uncle Abner”
or perhaps to have inherited*
the poor teeth of his maternal
grandmother. And if adults
were chronically tired or suffered
from “ nerves,” that,
too, was blamed on circumstances
that had nothing to
do with the diet.
No one bad ever heard o l hidden
h u n te r! For nutritionist* had
not yet startled the
world by demonstrating
that food
may satisfy the appetite
and yet fail
to feed . . . that
the absence of m inute
amounts of
minerals and vitamins
may be responsible
for a long
train of deficiency
diseases w h i c h
cause untold m isery
and are responsible for mental
and physical inefficiency.

Planning Mealt Scientifically
Today we know that a definite
relationship exists between food
consumption and bodily activity,
and that normal individuals can
usually control body weight by
regulating the amount of fuel
foods in the diet. We know that
minerals and vitam ins play a powerful
part in building and m a in taining
sound teeth as well as
healthy nerves; and that we can
build resistance to disease, defer
old age, and even lengthen the
span of life by choosing our food,
not merely for its appetite appeal,
but for the qualities that contribute
toward what nutritionists term
a balanced diet.
or nuts, usually served at lunch
or supper: two vegetables besides'
potatoes, one of which should be
of the raw, leafy variety; two
servings of fruit, and at least one
serving of a whole grain cereal.
By adhering to this plan, you
will help to supply your fam ily
with the necessary proteins, m in erals,
vitam ins and cellulose. Fuel
foods may be added by way ol
breadstulTs, macaroni, rice and
other cereals; butter or margarine
and the fats used in cooking.
The Balanced Diet
Every modern homemaker
therefore owes it to her fam ily not
to plan meals at random, but to
take into consideration the seven
factors that science has determined
to be essential for top
health. These include: protein
for building and repairing body
tissue; carbohydrates to produce
quick heat and energy; fats, a
more compact form of fuel; m in erals,
which serve both as builders,
and as regulators of body
processes; vitam ins A, B, C, D. E
and G, which act as regulators,
and help to prevent the various deficiency
diseases; water, which
serves as a vehicle by which food
is carried to the tissues, and cellulose
or bulk, required for the norm
a l functioning of the intestinal
tract.
A Day's Food Plan
The various food essentials will
be supplied if the three daily
meals include a q uart of m ilk for
every child, a pint for each adult,
which m ay be served as a beverage,
with cereals, in soups, sauces
or made into desserts; an egg
daily, or at least three or four
weekly; one serving of meat, fish
or chicken, usually at the m ain
m eal of the d ay ; a second protein
food, such as cheese, baked beans
Common Errors in Menu Planning
Common mistakes in menu plan
ning are a concentration of toe
many proteins or carbohydrates
in one meal; the failure to includt
adequate bulk by way of fruits,
vegetables and whole grain cereals;
and the massing in one meai
of too m any foods that are high ir
fat.
The following menu, for exam
pie, contains more protein thar
necessary, and too little bulk, yel
it is typical of the dinners served
in many homes: H amburget
Steak, Baked Beans. Potatoes.
Stewed Corn, Custard Pie.
Since both m e at and baked
beans are rich in protein, they
may well be served at separate
meals, as indicated by either ol
the following combinations: H am burger
Steak. Creamed Potatoes,
String Beans, Lettuce Salad,
Fresh or Cooked Fruit. Or, Baked
Beans, Stewed Tomatoes, Cabbage
Salad, Custard Pie.
In the first menu, the beans, po
tatoes, corn and pastry are al)
high carbohydrate foods. To provide
additional bulk, as well as
to reduce the amount of carbohydrate,
it would be advisable to
serve a green vegetable such a i
string beans, and choose fruit instead
of pie for dessert. It is assumed,
of course, that eggs would
be given in some other form d u ring
the day.
Since baked beans contain both
protein and carbohydrate, we omi'
potatoes in the third menu, and
serve a food rich in vitam in C—
the tomatoes, and add a bulk)
raw vegetable by way of the salati
It's Balance That Counts
It requires no more tim e or ef
fort to prepare nutritionally cor
rect meals than those which tack
balance, nor is it more expen
sive. For elaborate meals can lack
balance, if they are deficient ie
minerals, vitam ins and bulk, while
those composed of such simple
foods as bread and m ilk , and
stewed fruits may provide an
abundance of the protective substances
which satisfy the hidden
hunger of the body.
My plea to homemakers is to
give less thought to the prepara
tion of elaborate recipes, and
more thought to supplying the food
values that will create abundant
health and vitality. In that way,
I believe we shall take a real step
forward in human progress,

Varnish the Soles.—P aint the
soles of boots and shoes with any
quick-drying varnish. School boots
| will not need to go so often to the
repairer’s after this treatment.
e e e
Chilling Canned Goods.— Since
paper acts as an insulator, paper
wrappers should be removed from
canned goods before placing the
cans in the refrigerator to chill.
e e e
Let Youngsters Learn.—It is the
wisest plan to allow young people
to manage their own money, after
handing over a fixed sum for their
keep. In this way they learn the
value of money and are encouraged
to save, thus giving them a
good training for future responsibilities.
e e e
Improving Whipping C re am .—
When whipping cream for desserts
or salads add three m arsh mallows
cut in four pieces each
to a half-pint of cream and whip
until the desired stiffness is obtained.
The marshmallows will
whip into the cream and you will
j find it much lighter and fluffier
as well as having a fine flavor.
e e e
That's the S p irit.—Silk stockings
I can be preserved if, when new,
they are soaked in methylated
spirit for five minutes, then hung
up in the air until the smell has
evaporated. This treatment makes
them ladderless for a long time
and the good work will be further
carried on if a line of m achining
is run around the top just below
the "suspender line."
Chin Candles. — Thoroughly
chilled in the refrigerator, wax
candles will burn slower and Iasi
longer.

Cleaning the Range.—Coarss
sandpaper will remove any rough,
ness from the neglected g ai
range.

Cutting Cooking Time. — The

O F P I Q U E L I K E Y O U R S I I F 1
“Murder Machine”
H e l l o , e v e r y b o d y :
George H. Dowd of the Bronx, N. Y., sends me a letter
that starts out, “This is the first time I have ever tried to put"
an experience of mine down on paper. Shall I stop?”
Well, the answer to that is: For Pete’s sake, no, George.
Because George has turned in one hum-dinger of a yarn. It’s
the story of a barrage of flying steel that was set off, not by
powder or any other sort of explosive, but by actual horsepower
—28 horses, galloping hell-bent for election, drawing behind them
a machine that spued death-dealing projectiles right, left, front
and center.
It’s the only case I ever heard of where projectiles were
thrown by horses. Maybe some of those sword-rattling dictators
of Europe will pick up this idea and use horses when their supply
of powder runs low. I haven’t done any experimenting with
this idea and I don’t know how well it would work. But I ’ll tell
you George Dowd’s story and you can figure it out for yourself.
It happened along about the middle of July, 1913, on the
Idaho Falls Development company dry farm, a few miles
northwest of Idaho F alls, Idaho. That farm was a seven-thousand acre
wheat ranch. Out in that section they harvest their wheat in Ju ly, and
George, who was just a young fellow then, had a job working on one
of the big combine harvesters, sewing up sacks of grain.
There were three of those harvesters in the lield—one drawn
by mules, a second drawn by a steam engine or tractor, and the
third, on which George was working, drawn by 28 head of horses.
Those combine harvesters have a group of cylinders in them,
hitched to the wheels and geared up to revolve at great speed
when the horses are walking. George was working on a wooden
platform on that harvester, directly over thos* revolving cylinders.
B ut the cylinders weren’t revolving at the moment, for
the big machine was stopped for some minor repairs. The repair
Piece by piece tbe platform was being shot away.
1 m an was putting a draper belt into the header, and the driver
and the header m an got down to help him , leaving George alone
on the machine.
Steam Pressure Explodes Safety Valve.
And then the fun started—but it wasn't any fun for George Dowdl
It was the steam tractor hauling one of the other harvesters
that started all the trouble. There was too much steam in the
boiler and all of a sudden the safety valve popped off with a
bang. "A n d within the same second,” says George, "off went the
28 horses with the machine I was on in what you would call a
real ru naw a y!”
Well, sir, a 28 horse runaway is something to write home about,
but that was only the beginning. The men who were putting in the
draper belt were knocked clear of the machine at the first jum p the
horses made. Then those animals were off down .the field at a full gallop
with the great unwieldy machine careening along behind them! And
as they dashed along, the cylinders of the harvester, which revolved at
high speed when the horses were just walking, began revolving at a
speed greater than even steel can stand!
The horses hadn't gone a dozen feet when steel cylinders began
bursting front centrifugal force and shooting out of the m a chine
in all directions. The first one ripped up through the boards
on which George was standing—ripped up with a deafening crack
like the report of a cannon and shot past George's nose, straight
up in the air. Another one followed—and another. Cylinders,
gears and bits of broken metal came flying out of that machine
in a veritable barrage.
He Clung to the Harvester’s Reeling Platform.
“ I was on the U. S. S. Leviathan for 22 months during the war,”
George says, "a n d I have heard her guns bark a good m any times.
And I would say that the reports these gears and hunks of metal made
when leaving the machine were about as loud as those made by a sixinch
cannon.”
And George, standing right in the midst of that hail of flying steel,
couldn’t do anything about it. He was having all he could do to cling
to the swaying, reeling platform of that harvester while the horses galloped
along at breakneck speed. Piece by piece and board by board, the
fir flooring of the platform was shot away until it was even with the heels
of his shoes.
I f he’d thought of it, he might have jum ped, but for tbe first
few moments he was too bewildered. He could feel the wind of
those deadly metal projectiles as they whizzed by h im . One of
them h it him In the calf of the leg. Others ripped great holes in
the canvas awning over his head. "There were pieces of steel
weighing three or four pounds shot from that harvester,” he says,
" t h a t were picked up later more than a mile aw ay.”
Help Was Already on the Way.
But meanwhile, help was already on the way. The repair m an had
a good saddle horse tied nearby and in less than half a minute he was
in the saddle, riding hard. The runaways had almost a quarter of a
mile head start, but gradually he closed up that distance. The barrage
of steel had stopped by then, and George was safe as long as he could
cling to his perch on the shattered platform.
He did cling to that platform. He clung to it for a full mile,
while the harvester reeled and swayed and threatened to tip over.
Rut at the end nf that mile the repairman caught up with the
lead horses and brought them to a stop.
George says that harvester was nearly new when it started, but it
was a total wreck when it stopped. George, on the other hand, was
lucky. His only injury was where that one piece of flying steel had hit
his right leg. “ And that,” he says, “ wasn’t serious.”

PEOPLE in New York are
still talking about Charlie
McCarthy’s first week there.
In fact, a new aristocracy
sprung into being; its members
were the people who had
actually gone to the first
b r o a d c a s t (tic k e ts were
scarcer than hen’s teeth),
and they are still high-hatting
their friends who couldn’t get
in, and running perfectly good
luncheons and dinner parties by
insisting on telling about how cute
Charlie is.
"V o u simply have to see him to
appreciate h im ,” they declare,
which is rather hard on the people
who have never seen Charlie and
probably won't get a chance, as
Ed g ar Bergen is too busy for personal
appearances.
Charlie's kidnaping, one evening,
by the amusement editor of one of
the newspapers, very nearly stirred
up a lot of trouble. The famous
little man Is insured for $2,500.
Bergen was so worried that after
Charlie's reappearance he took to
taking Charlie apart and hiding him
in sections.

King Solomon once attended the j

Guilty Conscience
A meek little m an was in court for

Warner Brothers, and it’s an old
studio custom to play down the departing
star, since advertising h im
ju st means that you’re promoting
property that will soon belong to
somebody else.
So the charming and hard-working
Ann gets big billing in this one,
after five years of doing her best
with whatever roles came her way.
Katherine Hepburn is doing very
well indeed in her new theatrical
venture, “ The Philadelphia Story,”
although it has not, at this writing,
been given the acid test of presentation
in New York. Apparently
Miss Hepburn still cherishes some
affection for the screen; she has
bought the film rights to the play
and will do it herself before the
cameras eventually.
Nowadays it seems that everybody
who can’t get a job feels that
the answer to the unemployment
problem is becoming an orchestra
leader. Prize fighters, millionaires,
tap-dancers, movie stars—all are
more than willing to step in front
of a band and wave a baton. But
it’s a rare thing for a m an who
works with his hands to become an
orchestra leader—Russ Morgan is
about the only exception to the rule.
He's an ex-coal miner, you know.
He worked in the Nanticoke Mine,
near Scranton, Pa., until the forem
an flred him for playing a trom bone
in his spare time. The forem
a n happened to be his father.
Today he is one of the top bracket
orchestra leaders. Before he was
twenty-one he had written arrangements
for such famous m usical men
as John Phillip Sousa and Victor
Herbert.

V /f A RY ANN was named for her
* * grandmother, who at the age
of nine, made an elaborate s am pler
of embroidery stitches. Everyone
thought it would be nice if
the modern Mary Ann could also
do a bit of hand work to be framed
and kept. We here report, thanks
to a series of rainy afternoons,
this was actually accomplished.
Mary Ann’s mother started the
project with a rather large piece
of blue gingham ; a pair of em broidery
hoops and some odds and
ends of bright six strand mercerized
embroidery thread. Outlines
for flower designs were made by
drawing around coins and the flowers
were embroidered as shown
here. Stems were done in outline
stitch and leaves in groups of
straight stitches.
From the many attempts on that
piece of gingham, two flower
groups had almost as much life
and charm as the modern Mary
Ann, age nine. These were neatly
framed and lend a gay note at
each side of an old mirror.

Helping Seedt Along
T 'H E first step toward insuring
* germination of seeds is proper
planting. In exceptionally dry
weather, however, even properly
planted seeds may not germinate.
It is advisable in such a case to
prepare the dry soil for the seed.
Water freely, as though you had
a crop growing. Allow the water to
soak in and when the soil has
good moisture content, begin your
planting. You must be careful,
of course, not to plant in wet,
muddy soil.
Excessive rainfall, on the other
hand, may make the soil so moist
as to cause rotting of planted
seeds. If they have not germinated
within a reasonable length of
time after planting, a few of them
should be dug up and examined.
If rotting is indicated, another
planting must be made.
While few vegetable seeds require
special treatment to assist
germination, numerous flower
seeds can successfully be treated,
according to Gilbert Bentley, flower
expert of the Ferry Seed Breeding
Station.
He advises as follows: Nick
the seed coat of lupin, moonflower
and morning glory; remove the
rough outer coating of nasturtium,
momordica, castor bean and sand
verbena; soak canna, lily, jo b ’s
tear and sweet pea seeds in water
for 12 hours b e f o ip la n t in g .

I'se Inhalittor to Revive Girl
Rhinelander city firemen were called
to a physician’s office March 22 to
revive an injured child by means of
the fire department’s new inhalator.
Brought into use after the child had
-tpparently stopped breathing, the inhalator
quickly revived the patient by
forcing about one-quarter of a tank of
oxygen into the child’s lungs.
The injured child was Dawn Wiseman,
412-year-old daughter of Mrs.
Vernon Wiseman, of W'ittenberg. The
girl’s left arm was badly lacerated
and bruised when it was caught in a
wringer on a washing machine at the
home of Mrs. Lillian Bitters, 314
Center street. Mrs. Bitters is Dawn’s
aunt, and the child had been staying
at the Bitter home.
Taken to the physician’s office for
treatment, the girl suddenly lapsed
into unconsciousness. Firemen were
called and arrived with the inhalator
just after the child apparently stopped
breathing.
Members of the fire department
who handled the inhalator were Chief
Henry Hansen. Capt. Owen Anderson !
and Firemen Frank Dobbs and Her- j
man Samuelson, all veterans of the
force.
Since it was purchased less than two J
years ago, the fire department’s inhalator
has been used about a dozen i
times to revive persons in urgent j
need of oxygen. The inhalator has
been credited with saving several lives I
here since it was purchased.— Rhine- j
