         <p>There are 16 patients in the Tomah Indian hospital, as following namesâ€” Delos
            Yellowbank, Godfrey Mallory, William Blackdeer, Freeman Thompson, Peter White, Frank
            Pigeon, Edna La Mere Decorah, Bemdine and Geraldine Decorah who are twins, Esther
            Blackhawk, Lena Mae Decorah, Ann Lonetree, Carrie Thunder, Lucy Funmaker, Stella Johnson
            and Charlie Blackdeer. As we understand that, Indian signed for the winter, not much
            snow this winter on ground but we will have a few days cold first part of next month,
            and you will believe or not. The Indians can tell some weather by wild animals and stars
            too ari3 very few know these things at present. Perhaps next generation will not know
            anythings about these things. A girl was born to Mr. and Mrs. Edward Lonetree last
            Saturday, Jan. 7, 1939, at Indian hospital. .</p>
