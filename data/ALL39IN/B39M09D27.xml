    Black River Falls Wisconsin Wednesday September 27 1939 CUMBERLAND CREAMERY
    LEASED The leasing o f the Cumberland Cooperative creamery by the Stella
    Cheese Co which operates one o f its seven cheese factories at Clayton
    seemed certain following negotiations carried on over the past week An
    agreement which calls for a one year lease with three additional years
    optional or sale at any time has been confirmed by both the creamery board o
    f directors and the Stella Cheese Co directors A special meeting of the
    creamery stockholders will ?be called for Friday Sept 22 to confirm these
    negot ations In view of the strong sentiment for selling outright which
    developed at an earlier meeting o f the stockholders it is anticipated that
    this new lease arrangement will be carried through without great opposition
    The Stella company will take over immediately on contract confirmation The
    sale price included in the agreement calls for $19 000 The earlier sale
    which narrowly failed of being carried out was $15 000 The terms o f the
    lease call for a rental o f $140 a month with a premium o f 50c per hundred
    pounds o f milk as the volume received grows which will give an additional
    maximum $320 o f returns to creamery stockholders when the volume reaches a
    million pounds milk monthly The new operators will continue to make butter
    here without any interruption in operations trucking milk received here to
    the Clayton plant for cheese manufacturing The Stella Cheese Co is the only
    firm in this country making an Italian cheese and with war abroad certain to
    bring a decline in imports their position in the market is a strong one The
    company has been in existence for 23 years growing gradually to become the
    strong firm it now is The Cumberland creamery will become the 8th plant unit
    in its organization The same price for milk will be paid here as at Clayton
    where patrons have received at least a half cent and up to one cent or more
    above the price paid by any creamery in this territory It means that to
    patrons the new arrangement will be a highly satisfactory one from the
    standpoint of returns for their milk REAL ESTATE BARGAINS FARM 91 acre* Good

    Telephone 121 Black River Falls Wi* SCHOOL SPIRIT Every year around this
    time the subject o f school spirit becomes a rather important issue around
    here School spirit in general does not belong to any one phase It s the
    pride and interest you take in your school and its activities It s the part
    that you don t learn in books but once you acquire it you ll do your best to
    uphold the ideals o f your school At this time school spirit can be applied
    to conduct at footfall games You ve heard all this dozens o f time3 but do
    you practice it Let s start with the opposing team When another school comes
    here to compete they are guests o f Black River High so let s treat them as
    such Show courtesy at all times acknowledge a particularly good feat by one
    o f their players and above all be a good loser No matter how badly you may
    feel try not to show it It takes a lot to be a good loser On the other side
    you have to learn to be a good winner too Don t lord it all over your
    opponents if your team wins After all they tried hard too Football players
    are taught good sportmanship on the gridiron so let s apply it in the
    cheering section How about some courtesy to your own team It s easy to cheer
    them on when they re winning but do you stick by them when they re losing
    Sometimes a game just isn t meant to be won no matter how hard they fight so
    don t desert them when they need your support most Sideline coaches are not
    appreciated so it s better to just think how you would have executed that
    last play than to voice it Don t be the first to criticize when a player
    fumbles a ball or makes some other mistake It isn t as easy to do as it
    looks and just try putting yourself in the players place These suggestions
    aren t set rules but all constitute a part o f showing good school spirit So
    when you re watching the next football game just stop and ask yourself Am I
    showing good school spirit GRADS RETURN A number o f students are taking
    post graduate work at school this year Some o f them graduated last year and
    some the year before They are Margie Tucker Mary Rose Boyer Ives Anderson
    Wayne Glennie Flora Harper and Earl Thiele We are glad to have these
    students back with us again this year MAY I PRESENT A rather quiet and very
    friendly man Mr Hanson who when asked what his pet dislikes were said I
    really haven t any I m very much satisfied with life Now that s something He
    s very fond o f hunting and football is his favorite sport He played on his
    High school and College teams His favorite form o f recreation is his farm
    about 160 miles from here His ambition is to retire and live there Mr Hanson
    told me that he likes his boys very much and wants any o f the students to
    feel free to come to him for any kind o f help He likes Black River Falls
    immensely and thinks we have a fine school system Mr Hanson confessed that
    he has one weakness and grinned guiltily when he said that he simply can t
    walk he d much rather ride But who wouldn t He says that he vows each day to
    start hiking to school the next day but by the time he has that extra forty
    winks he hasn t time to walk oh well such is life Here s to Mr Hanson our
    new Ag teacher B R High is for you and hopes that you ll be with us for a
    long time before you retire on your farm FOOTBALL SCHEDULE The football
    games that are to be played at B R Falls this year will be played under the
    lights at the fair grounds The games are sched uled to start at 8 00 The
    football schedule for this year is as follow s Sept 22 Durand away Sept 27
    Whitehall here Oct 4 Arcadia there Oct 11 Augusta here Oct 20 Mondovi here
    Oct 27 New Lisbon there AGRICULTURE NEW AND INTERESTING Mr Hanson is
    teaching the new subject agriculture which is starting out very successfully
    There are 45 boys enrolled which is better than the average all over the
    state This is a very practical subject the classes are going out on farms
    for their work Some o f the things taught to the four classes are Soil and
    Crops Farm Management and Farm Mechanics The class room is well arranged and
    equipped with new work tables and a demonstration table DOTS AND DASHES No
    this isn t going to be an article on the Morse Code it s merely a new column
    making its debut There s nothing like starting out with a bang in the first
    issue o f this year s Oriole so here it is We hope you ll like our dots n
    dashes (with lots of flashes) As in columns following this we shall attempt
    to give you some first hand information o f what goes on behind scenes in
    this great institution o f learning This is to be mixed with a little humor
    and miscellaneous items O f course no column would be complete without a few
    well known romance headlines so here they be Starting with the spphs it
    seems that Sister Horswill and Billy Squires have been doing all right by
    themselves Jumping to the mighty ( ) seniors we hear that Warren Herried is
    wearing the road from B R F to Merrillan just about out Could it be a blonde
    Going on we find that Jerry Northup is very attentive to post grad Margy
    Tucker An added note Wilma Dunn seems to be having a gay time these days We
    wonder why Good jokes are rather scarce at the moment although there s
    always the one about the sleepy junior who walked into his first period
    class 20 minutes late The teacher with that certain look in his eye remarked
    You should have been here at 8 20 Why What happened said our sleepy junior
    Perhaps we d better stop now while the stopping s good See you next time
    HENRY ! ! ! Have you heard about Henry You havent s Why I thought every one
    knew Henry! Well if you don t know him perhaps I d better describe him Henry
    is quite old and I must say hes still quite handsome Well perhaps his joints
    do squeak and when he runs he sort a coughs and wheezes but never the less
    Henry is quite spry for his age His bony framework reminds us o f a skeleton
    and his big glassy eyes stare straight ahead Some say he hasn t much longer
    to live but I personally think he will carry on at least a couple o f years
    Altho he makes students very happy by carrying them around he is sometimes
    tireless (Get it ) Oh yes experts and some who are not so expert say he will
    just stop some day and be unable to go any farther and when he does May he
    rest in peace knowing that he has done his duty (and then some) in this
    world in which we live Well perhaps many o f you know who Henry is If you
    don t Henry is an old Model T Ford belonging to Dave Noble Dave worked hard
    to get the car (if you can call it that) fixed up for use Henry went on a
    long trip this summer and he did stand it (Some o f us wonder how anyone o f
    that age could) Dave Jim Pugh Slug Haralson Ronnie Anderson and Bob Squires
    went to Sturgeon Bay around Lake Michigan to Milwaukee and then home (with
    Henry) It is rumored that in Milwaukee Henry thought Dave was being too hard
    on him so he stopped right in the middle o f one o f the largest avenues
    there Dave got out but Henry refused to budge It was then that Dave
    remembered that Henry was very stubborn when he didn t get his gasoline at
    certain intervals Well Dave just gave him a couple o f swallows and promised
    him more when he came to a gas station But when they had passed ten or more
    stations Henry got to thinking and he decided Dave was kidding him and again
    he stopped This time at a zoo where all the animals laughed at poor Henry
    and said Why don t you get a horse This made Henry so angry that he roared
    and they started off They got home safely I don t know whether he has gotten
    over being mad yet or not For further details ask Henry STUDENT OF B R F
    WINS TRIP TO STATE FAIR Merle Jacoby a Sophomore o f B R F High and Stanley
    Gilbertson formerly a student o f this school recently won a notable place
    for the Jackson County 4 H Club with a zinc metal demonstration By proving
    their ability in this line they won a free trip to the State Fair at
    Milwaukee I was talking to Merle the other day and this is his story o f the
    trip Well first o f all on July 13th Stanley and I gave a zinc metal
    demonstration at Withee and won first place That gave us a trip to Madison
    Mr Bean the county agent took us to the cities At Madison we competed with
    five demonstrators We received second place which gave us a trip to
    Milwaukee We were in P c ir o o s S Star Brand H U N T I N G B O O T S And
    you ll choose as fine a boot as ever you ve set foot into Soft mellow uppers
    keep you comfortable husky soles l a u g h at wear What a combination what a
    value! V ? { f io? Madison during State Club week I stayed for a week but
    Stanley stayed only one day Fair week in Milwaukee was from Saturday Aug
    19th to Sunday the 27th Stan and I went to the fair on Tuesday the 22nd
    There were 70 demonstration teams at the fair and it took three days to go
    through all o f them to pick out the highest five teams We were one o f the
    highest five At Milwaukee the club members stayed in two dormitories We all
    ate together Each county had a table and we could sit only at that table
    Before meals we would sing songs and each morning before breakfast we would
    pledge allegiance to the flag Then in the morning we got a program for the
    day Of course we saw the exhibits on the Fair grounds We went through the
    machinery exhibit and on all the rides! I believe we liked the roller
    coaster the best Then we saw a beautiful grandstand attraction Thursday
    after a swell time we came home This didn t give us a chance to run in the
    finals which meant a trip to Chicago The county agent afterward told us we
    couldn t have taken the trip to Chicago even if we had won because we had
    already won two trips and two trips was all that was allowed any team We had
    to work to get our demonstration in shape but it sure was worth it From what
    Merle said I m sure we all believe it was worth it W e re all glad you could
    go Merle and we ll be betting on you next season o f the half With the ball
    on the Durand 40 the enemy half back faded back and tossed a pass to a man
    wide open downfield who carried it for a touchdown Whiteaker B R end
    smothered the attempt for the extra point At the start o f the 4th quarter
    found the ball deep in B R territory On the first play Carisch broke away
    for 10 Upton hit the line for 9 and Horswill made it a first down on the 35
    Smashing viciously downfield displaying a hard running attack B R finally
    scored on Horswill s plunge B R failed in the attempt for the extra point
    Horswill Score* Again Late in the last quarter B R had possession o f the
    ball on the Durand 40 Horswill took the ball sliced through tackle behind
    beautiful block ing and cut into the open for a touchdown B R scored 15
    first downs to 2 for Durand The game tonight will be the first night game in
    Black River Falls football history It will be played at the Fair grounds
    against Whitehall B R TRAMPLES DURAND A veteran B R team after starting
    slowly gathered terrific momentum and rolled to a 18 to 6 victory over
    Durand Starting 11 lettermen Coach Edlebeck s boys fulfilled every thing
    expected o f them and won easily Northrup Score* Early in the first quarter
    B R scored quickly but didn t score again until early in the 4th quarter
    With the ball on the 6 yard line Lowe B R quarterback took the ball from
    center faked a line plunge and tossed a short pass to Northrup in the end
    zone Whiteaker s attempt from placement for the extra point was blocked The
    remainder o f the half saw B R in possession o f the ball deep in Durand
    territory many times but they couldn t capitalize and put it over Durand
    Ties It Up A fter the rest period between the halves an inspired Durand team
    took the field and scored on the third play CO OPERATIVE NEWS By Earl
    Horswill There is an old assumption that co operatives are born in times o f
    distress and that they will only grow and flourish in depression periods
    However statistics gathered during the World War when high prices prevailed
    and huge profits were reaped goes to prove that that old adage is far from
    being correct The following figures just published in the International Co
    operative Alliance Bulletin represent the percentage o f sales increase o f
    the various national wholesale societies during 1915 the second year o f the
    war over the preceding year England 23 per cent Scotland 21 per cent Hungary
    52 per cent Finland 45 per cent Sweden 45 per cent Holland 26 per cent and
    Norway 44 per cent The French Co operative Wholesale trippled its business
    during the first three years of the war and in the same length o f time the
    Eng lish Co operative Wholesale Society increased its membership by 400 000
    bringing its membership to a total o f 2 710 000 and its sales to $300 000
    000 a year And so in this war period that we are now in co operators know
    that whatever the price may be and whatever the earnings may be there will
    be no profiteering for the earnings belong to them not to the profiteers and
    as more people learn o f the co operative way o f doing business the
    memberships are sure to grow When large co operative wholesales begin to co
    operate and work together then co operation takes a long stride forward That
    is exactly what happened on Aug 28 at the Minneapolis Y M C A when
    representatives o f Midland Co operative Whole sale Central Co operative

    conviction deepens that the co operative way is the only way for individuals
    and for nations Cooperating people in co operating countries will assure
    peace in the world While political and economic imperialistic leaders build

    Black River Falls Wisconsin PAGE No 3 a THE LA CROSSE BRIDGE Largest project
    ever built by the State Highway commission the new $1 400 000 bridge over
    the Mississippi river at La Crosse was dedicated and opened to travel on
    Saturday Federal state county and city officials co operated in the program
    Designed to carry wider and heavier vehicles than now permitted by law the
    bridge is expected to still be in service in 2015 A D State Highway
    commission engineers report the total bridge weighs 30 000 tons Excavation
    for the bridge would equal excavations for 75 average six room houses Timber
    piling under the bridge footings is 11 miles long while the reinforcing
    steel in the bridge would make one long bar 136 miles long All o f the steel
    in the bridge would build 24 miles o f railroad while the concrete would
    pave 42 miles o f sidewalk or 6*4 miles o f state highway The ornamental
    railing on the bridge would fence a 43 acre farm while the electricity
    required to energize the roadway navigation and aviation warning lights on
    the bridge would light 50 American homes If America like Germany were to
    turn its bridges into armament the La Crosse bridge would provide enough
    structural steel to equip every soldier in the present American army with a
    Springfield rifle a steel helmet and an automatic sidearm supply every
    fourth man with a Browning machine gun and 48 pound tripod and have over 400
    000 pounds of steel left for replacements Miss Julia Tollack left Saturday
    for the east where she will visit indefinitely She will spend some time in
    New York City as well as other points o f interest in the east BEN LANNING S
    PEACHES The following story regarding the Lanning peaches appeared in
    Thursday s La Crosse Tribune and gives Mr Lanning credit for the first local
    peach crop The story will be read with interest by his friends Ben P Lanning
    who resides on the corner of Polk and Melrose streets is responsible for the
    first peaches in the city A peach pit thrown outside five years ago took
    root and when large enough to look like something different Mr Lanning
    transplanted it to the back o f his lot where it would grow undisturbed Each
    fall Mr Lanning wound it with twisted hay and at first put a stove pipe over
    it for protection filling the top o f the pipe with grass and leaves The
    tree soon outgrew its stovepipe and a large furnace pipe was used the same
    procedure being used The back lot on which the tree was located was sold to
    Mr and Mrs Louis Gardipee and they have built a new home there This year the
    tree is 10 feet high five years old and produced six peaches which were
    divided between the Lannings and Gardipees and eaten while they wore still
    green! Mr Lanning said there were many blossoms this spring and he was
    afraid the youngsters would get at the fruit before he did A musk melon was
    on display at the B Joffice last Friday that measured 34 inches in
    circumference and weighed 15 pounds It was grown by Leonard Peterson o f the
    town o f Irving Many large melons o f that variety have been brought in this
    fall but the quality has not been equal to usual Melons o f all kinds have
    been plentiful and cheap Mildred s Dress Shoppe Black River Falls W HITEHALL

    MINNEAPOLIS MILLERS HERE SUNDAY OCT 1 During the past baseball season the
    Black River Falls Merchants Base Ball Club have been giving the baseball
    fans in this section of Wisconsin the chance to see the best in semipro and
    traveling teams available In every game played during 1939 the opposition
    has been the best that could be scheduled This policy of getting the best
    has been well appreciated by the fans and now as a special treat for the
    support the ball bugs have given the team throughout the season the
    Merchants management are presenting the Minneapolis Millers o f the American
    Association featuring past and future Major league stars Such men as Butland
    and Hash who during the past season were sensations in their League and are
    hailed as future greats in the American League will be on hand Both Butland
    and Hash will twirl for the Boston Red Sox next year Lacey and Pofahl will
    also be at the fair grounds with the Millers next Sunday These gents also
    have contracts with Major league clubs for 1940 Other baseball greats with
    the Millers are Wasdell who performed during the early part o f the past
    season with the Washington Senators Ab Wright who also did some big time
    duty and can that gentleman ever wield the old woodwork! The whole works
    will be on hand as well as a house full of customers The game here Sunday
    will be the finale for both ihe Millers and the Merchants and will be called
    promptly at 2 30 And here is another bit o f good news the customers will be
    admitted to this game at the regular prices charged during the season ain t
    that somethin ! We want to warn the good folks to be on hand early so as to
    get good seats because the ball park will be plenty cluttered up with ball
    fans The Millers have already played four or five games on the present
    barnstorming trip and in every instance have jammed the ball park Black
    River Falls will be the smallest city on their tour but this area being
    littered with baseball fans as it is we believe that they will play before
    one o f the largest crowds on their tour here in B R Falls Leastwise we have
    been pestered with questions about the date of the game ever since it was
    mentioned its tentative in last week s Banner Journal It will cost the
    Merchant management a nice roll of folding dough to get them big shot babies
    to perform here too and that s no kidding but Ernie could think of no better
    way of showing his appreciation to the fans for their support and so his
    Beau Geste is the rare treat of getting practically a big league ball club
    for a show Lots of the boys and gals want us to climb out on the limb and
    make a prediction as to the outcome o f the game so we asked the Merchant
    managent what brand o f talent will be sent in against the visitors and here
    s the dope we got two former major leaguers will be on the opposite side o f
    the Minneapolis team plus Ernie on the hill Hoard receiving Hauser at first
    some bird from the Pacific Coast League at second an old pal o f Babe Ruth s
    and home run baser extraordinary one Robert Teeples at short the former
    Winnipeg Star Ellison at third and we didn t get the rest o f the line up
    straight yet But we will say that with what Ernie has behind him he should
    give the Millers a very substantial cud to exercise the proverbial dentistry
    on e don t think the Merchants will kick the Millers around the ball park
    but we will venture to say that the big time boys will have quite an
    interesting time of it It will be well to recall at this time that Ernie
    hurled against the Milwaukee Brewers at Eau Claire earlier and in spite a
    verv sore arm was nosed out by only 7 to 6 With a stronger team behind him
    as Ernie will have here next Sunday the Merchant chances for victory should
    be about even and an airtight game should ensue We will repeat the details
    of the game Place the Jackson County Fair Grounds Time Sunday Oct 1 at 2 30
    Opponents Minneapolis Millers Bla ck River Falls Merchants Respective
    lineups will appear on broadside announcements to be distributed within a 75
    mile radius See you at the ball game! BOY SCOUTS MEET The first meeting o f

    great deal o f publicity is being given to the story that a WPA garden
    project has been discontinued after $20 000 has been spent and $500 worth o
    f vegetables produced This is by no means a new experience During World War
    No 1 scores o f men and women were employed in a movement to get every
    fantily to have a garden to relieve the food crisis The results were but
    little if any better than that o f the WPA project the story tells of The
    cause o f these garden failures is not unfavorable growing conditions but
    inefficiency on the part o f the men and women who have the projects in
    charge their lack o f knowledge on soils proper preparation and the care
    after the seeds are planted With good soil careful preparation good seed and
    proper tillage during the growing season a garden will yield an immense
    amount of valuable food and be a source o f real satisfaction to whoever
    tends it Some idea o f the intensity o f the unprecedented September heat
    wave from which this entire section o f the country suffered last week may
    be gained from the record o f the thermometers on Main street Last week we
    reported they read from 96 to 112 Thursday the same instruments at the same
    place were mostly two degrees higher Friday there was a strong breeze but it
    was a hot one ? and seemed to blow the heat into every nook and cranny Many
    ther I mometers in the shade registered 98 and while those in the blazing
    sun were not as high as on the two previous days the intense heat was more
    generally distributed The leaves on trees and vines ripened and changed
    color rapidly giving the appearance o f fall although it was so hot Saturday
    it was also warm but not uncomfortably so Emil J Peterson has purchased the
    residence erected last fall and which since completion has been occupied by
    Robert Sechler and family It is diagonally across the street from the fine
    new home occupied by Mr and Mrs Peterson There are several applicants for
    renting the newly acquired property It is understood that Mr Sechler will
    move to the John J Dietrich farm as soon as Mr Dietrich vacates and that he
    will specialize in raising sheep turkeys and chickens A card received from
    Marty Marquardt is postmarked Salem Mass and Marty informs us that he had
    just eaten a platter o f clams and were they good! Mr Marquardt is enjoying
    a well earned vacation from his duties as American Express agent in this

    COUNTY AGENT NOTES 4 H Club Much credit must be given the 4 H club members
    and local leaders for the wonderful showing made at the recent county fair
    Even though the number o f entries made by club members was slightly below
    that o f last year the articles showed a marked improvement in quality This
    marked improvement showed up throughout all entries but was especially
    noticeable in the clothing home improvement handicraft and livestock
    displays The 18 booths under the grandstand which were decorated in the 4 H
    colors were an example o f the untiring effort put forth by leaders and club
    members to display the articles made or grown by the members o f their clubs
    Some found it a difficult task to decorate their booths due to the large
    number o f articles to be exhibited The judge was asked to place the first
    five booths for the larger prizes and list all others since these clubs will
    receive equal amounts The first five placings were 1 North Bend 2 Pleasant

    is the third consecutive year that the York club has won the county
    championship In spite o f the rain Monday afternoon the crowd showed a great
    deal o f interest in the judging contests The crowded condition around the
    judging rings brings out the fact that the Jackson County Fair has grown to
    such proportions that we now need a judging pavilion where people might sit
    to watch the judging work Art Collentine and Professor Fuller livestock

    plantings next spring should place their orders with this o ffice before
    November 10th The limit o f the number o f free trees which any one person
    may obtain is set at 1000 according to an announcement by F B Trenk forester
    at the College o f Agriculture The free tree offer is open only to those
    farmers who have not received 1000 free trees in former years Any farmer who
    wishes another allotment of 1000 trees this year will be asked to pay a
    small charge Although the trees will not be shipped until the proper time
    for planting next spring the plan this year calls for ordering this fall
    This will permit the extension forester to check orders and see that the
    proper varieties are chosen for planting on each particular kind o f soil
    and that the farmer is given proper suggestions for planting Trenk calls
    attention to the necessity o f mentioning the particular kind o f trees
    wanted with each order For old fields on light sand soils three year old
    Norway pine seedlings are available While on very sandy soils subject to
    wind erosion Jack pine and Scotch pifte are being offered In northern
    Wisconsin where farmers wish to underplant thin stands o f oak or other
    hardwoods white spruce and white pine seedlings three year olds are being
    offered For thin oak woods for southern Wisconsin only white ash red oak and
    bass wood are most suitable Trenk reports that a supply o f black locust is
    available for planting along gullies and other eroded areas Anyone wishing
    to order such seedlings should obtain the proper application blank from the

    and rabbits can be prevented if one will take the time to carry out the
    simple methods at the right time o f the year Mice and rabbits are very
    plentiful this fall in most parts o f the state In a few cases mice have
    already started to girdle the trees Girdled trees must be considered a loss
    for even when bridge grafted some fail to recover while those in which the
    bridging is successful are usually badly stunted for several years An ounce
    o f pre vention is worth a pound o f cure To prevent mouse girdling adopt
    one or several o f the following measures 1 Remove grass manure and rubbish
    from the base o f the tree 2 Dig lightly around each tree trunk and mound
    the ground against the tree 3 Use a wire wood veneer Or heavy roofing paper
    protection around each tree trunk sinking it into the soil about two inches
    4 Place poisoned bait (obtained from the Wisconsin Horticulture Society
    Madison) in bait stations These stations may be old partly closed tin cans 1
    Vi inch tar paper rolls or small containers made o f wood the ends o f
    container open Rabbit damage can be practically eliminated in any orchard if
    some or all o f the following suggestions are carried out 1 In small
    orchards wrap the trunk and lower branches with burlap or strong paper 2 In
    large orchards one o f the better repellents should be brushed or sprayed on
    the trees Sulphonol and also Livingston s repellent have given good results
    with no apparent damage to the trees when properly applied Growers should
    follow the instructions on the package for best results 3 Keep fresh
    prunings on top of snow throughout the winter 4 Set traps with apples and
    carrots as bait 1940 Soil Program During the week o f October 2 7 meetings
    will be held in each township in the county to discuss the 1940 soil
    conservation program and to elect township committeemen who will carry out
    the work in their respective townships Notices giving the date time and
    place of each meeting will be mailed to all farmers who participated in the
    1939 program 1939 Soil Program During the past week a large number o f
    farmers met with members of the county committee to sign their applications
    for payment under the 1939 soil conservation program The first transmittal o
    f applications consisted o f 1233 regular applications and 306 wheat price
    adjustment applications Most of these applications were signed and have been
    mailed to the State Office for payment A second transmittal o f
    approximately 900 applications should arrive most any day HUNTING LICENSES
    The 1939 legislature revised section 29 09 o f the Wisconsin statutes which
    has an effect on the issuance o f hunting and trapping licenses The changes
    in the provisions of the statutes are as follows 1 Applications for hunting
    trapping and fishing licenses have been entirely eliminated 2 Those who
    issue licenses are no longer required to be commissioned as notaries public
    3 The minimum age o f a hunting license applicant has been reduced from 15
    to 12 with restrictions placed upon those between the ages of 12 and 16
    requiring them to be accompanied by a parent or guardian while hunting 4
    Persons purchasing licenses must apply in person to the county clerk or
    issuing agent 5 A notary fee or service charge can no longer be imposed on
    hunting and trapping license applicants by agents authorized to issue them 6
    County clerks are required by statutes to remit to the conservation
    department on the first day o f each month Consequently agents must co
    operate with country clerks in remitting for licenses sold 7 Applicants who
    failed to file a census report are required to forward written report
    covering all game killed during the term o f the expired license Here Are

    account o f the Fair were reported The field orchard and garden crops
    exhibited were not up to standard neither in quantity nor quality Smaller
    vegetables were undoubtedly due to poor growing season The exhibits o f
    apples were better than last year With field orchard and garden exhibits in
    all of the 4 H booths not so much can be expected elsewhere Matt Johanek
    showed milking machines and life distributing u ip ment He also talked a lot
    about lime A PEOPLE S WAR The present world war is another answer and an
    effective one to the old socialistic arguments that wars are started by
    kings princes and potentates and the people have nothing to do with it
    except the fighting and the dying It is an undisputed fact that the present
    war in western Europe was virtually formed on Premier Chamberlain and M
    Daladier by their people that if they had not come to Poland s assistance
    their governments would have fallen On that fateful Sunday when Chamberlain
    was still seeking to bring about an agreement with Hitler it was the leader
    o f the Labor Party in Great Britain which heckled the Prime Minister and
    accus It was a husky team of men who e(j him o f seeking to sell the Poles

    Live other surface well * IVER TORKELSON the Polish crisis arose there was a
    demand in England and France especially from the labor groups that the Poles
    be protected It is known in diplomatic circles that even up to the last many
    business and industrial groups in England and France were against going to
    war with Germany The same might be said of business and industrial groups in
    Berlin who do not think Hitler should fight the two western powers But the
    ire o f the people overrode everything else and we have another world war On
    the other side o f the picture Hitler personally is given the blame for
    invading Poland But it is to be remembered that Danzig almost to a man and
    woman have been demanding union with Germany and have been spoiling for a
    fight Even in Germany everyone except the racial socialists apparently were
    willing to fight because they were taught to believe that England was
    seeking to surround and smother them The reason why big business groups in
    every country have opposed war is that they well realize that a long drawn
    out struggle may spell the doom o f modern capitalistic civilization The
    countries are starting out with greater debt and tax burdens than they had
    in 1914 and with fewer resources And to the east is the Russian Bear licking
    his chops over prospective morsels in Poland and Germany Take the United
    States for example If we enter the contest we will start with a national
    debt o f $45 000 000 000 In 1917 our debt was negligible War may easily
    spell the doom o f modern economic society Big business knows it and has no
    enthusiasm for it This is a people s war because the people do not yet
    realize the precarious economic condition o f the world Republic Bulle tin

    two longer perhaps you d like to try some o f the suggestions sent in by
    Kathryn Herried o f Blair She says to boil carrots celery peppers onions and
    tomatoes all together Strain and can for soup Then in the winter try the
    following Boil a small box o f spaghetti Drain well and mix with a quart jar
    of soup Set in the oven and bake slowly several hours Soak beans over night
    Parboil and drain Cover with tomato soup bits o f pork and then bake Serve
    the tomato soup very hot with a small amount o f water and a tablespoon o f
    butter added for richness Mrs Theo Stenulson o f Black River Falls wrote
    such a nice letter to the Cookie Jar and requests that we repeat the recipe
    for Gum Drop Squares which was printed some time ago Here it is Gum Drop
    Squares 4 eggs well beaten 2 cups brown sugar 1 tbsp cold water cup nut
    meats M tsp cinnamon tsp baking powder 2 cups flour 1 cup cut up gumdrops
    orange slices preferred (Do not use black gumdrops) Bake on a thin sheet and
    cut in squares Mrs Stenulson sent the following recipes also Salad Dressing
    for Fruit or Cabbage Heat Vi cup sugar and M cup vinegar Pour over 3 well
    beaten eggs and return to heat Cook in double boiler until thick and thin
    with cream before using Try adding diced apples and raisins or peanuts to
    the cabbage for appetite appeal Jelly Roll 1 cup sugar 1 cup flour 3 eggs 3
    tbsp sweet milk tsp soda Vi tsp cream o f tartar Beat eggs add milk and
    combine with dry ingredients Bake in a moderate oven about 10 minutes Turn
    out on a damp towel Roll up at once Then unroll spread with jelly and roll
    up again Sprinkle with powdered sugar wrap in wax paper and tie to keep in
    shape until cooled DELICIOUS PIE MADE FROM BAKED PUMPKIN The day of the
    stewed pumpkin pie is about over the baked pumpkin pie is gradually taking
    its place Peeling and stewing pumpkins for pies is a tiresome job explains
    Mrs Charlotte Clark Buslaff o f the Wis consin College o f Agriculture so I
    bake mine instead It saves time energy and patience To do this cut a pumpkin
    in two and scoop out the seeds and fibrous material around them Then put the
    halves cut side down into a dripping pan or roaster and bake in a moderate
    oven until the pumpkin is very tender During the baking much of the moisture
    evaporates When the pumpkin is tender scoop it out o f the shell explains
    the specialist and put it through a colander so it will be well mashed Now
    it s ready to be made into pie Baked Pumpkin Pie Filling (Enough for one
    deep 9 inch plate) 2 eggs 2 3 cup white sugar and 2 tablespoons molasses or
    Vi cup white sugar and xk cup brown sugar (Sorghum may be used instead o f
    brown sugar) 1 cups baked mashed pumpkin 1 teaspoon cinnamon teaspoon ginger
    Vn teaspoon salt 1 M cups hot milk Beat the eggs slightly and stir in the
    sugar Add the pumpkin and seasonings Stir well and add the hot milk Pour
    into a pie plate lined with an unbaked pie crust Place in a hot oven for
    five minutes and then lower the temperature to moderate or 325 degrees F and
    bake for 45 to 55 minutes longer or until done We can tell when a pumpkin
    pie is done by using the same test as for a custard pie That is insert the
    point o f a knife into the center o f the pie When the knife comes out clean
    the pie is done Variation No 1 Sprinkle half a cup o f chopped pecans over
    the pie just before it is put into the oven Variation No 2 Beat the egg
    whites separately and fold them in last This makes a more flu ffy filling
    SLIP COVERS MAKE CHAIRS LOOK NEW There s nothing magical about slip covers
    but still they can make old worn chairs look new and cheerful Because
    furniture styles vary so much it s almost impossible to buy a slip cover
    pattern that will exactly fit a chair says Miss Wealthy Hale home management
    specialist at the University of Wisconsin Instead we make our own patterns
    out o f cheap unbleached muslin or old sheeting This cloth is laid on the
    chair and cut to fit To make a pattern we pin the material in place against
    the back o f the chair end with a pencil mark the seam lines at the ends o f
    the chair These seams are usually placed where they will be the least
    noticeable and also so they follow the seam lines of the upholstery The next
    step is to pin the material over the front o f the chair back and extend it
    over the seat and as far down the front as you wish continues Miss Hale The
    material must be worked well into the space between the back and the seat so
    that it will not pull out Darts which are used to get rid o f the fullness
    at the side corners can be marked with a pencil Continue with this same
    method until you have a pattern for every part o f the chair that you want
    covered If your chair has a loose cushion you can put a separate slip cover
    around it so it will be reversible A fter taking the pattern from the chair
    spread it out flat Mark a seam allowance of one half inch for plain or
    French seams and one fourth inch for bound seams Then cut out the cloth
    pattern baste it together and try it on the chair If it does not fit adjust
    the seams and darts so it covers the chair smoothly When the pattern fits
    you are ready to cut the slip cover from your good material Cut each piece
    on the straight o f the cloth Baste and stitch the seams together Brush
    braid or cording may be used at the seams to give a tailored effect A
    pleated flounce or ruffle may be added A zipper or placket may also be
    placed at one o f the side seams so the cover can be slipped off and on
    easily Finally press the cover and slip it on your chair CARD OF THANKS We

    MRS ARTHUR BUTTON BIRTH CERTIFICATES Our bureau o f vital statistics is
    being swamped with requests for copies o f birth certificates required for
    gaining pensions entering school or proving citizenship and sufficient age
    to take up employment This situation compels the state board o f health to
    voice an urgent request to the people it serves J Pra ctically every
    instance the birth record o f a Wisconsin native is on file in the office o
    f his countv register o f deeds or for natives of our cities in the office
    of the city health officer It will insure prompter action to ask one or the
    other o f these local offices for a copy o f a birth certificate thap to
    write to the state bureau for it The great increase o f such requests
    resulting from the enactment o f new pension laws has put the state bureau
    weeks behind in furnishing copies o f birth certificates As budget
    limitations will not permit employment o f additional help the cooperation o
    f our people is again sought as means o f keeping things going with the
    usual promptness G Man Got away did he Did you guard all the exits County

    R S B o o k k e e p e r MERLIN HULL S LETTER The president has spoken
    Contrary to custom he delivered his message outlining his reasons for
    calling a special session within two hours after the session opened
    Generally when Congress meets in any session at least a day elapses before
    special committees o f Senate and House don their best bib and tucker make a
    solemn journey to the White House and gravely and seriously inform the
    president that congress has convened and is ready to receive from him any
    message which he may desire to communicate On the following day he would
    either send his message by a White House employee or come in person and read
    it to the two houses in joint session For many years and until the Wilson
    administration presidents sent their messages which were read by the clerks
    in each house separately Mr Roosevelt has sent some and delivered some
    personally This time he appeared in person and before a large audience in
    the gallaries and with the members o f the two houses and members o f the
    cabinet on the floor read his speech The message was short and to the point
    He wants the embargo provision o f the Neutrality law repealed He would
    permit warring nations all over the world to buy arms and munitions from our
    country as freely as from their own factories He would repeal the Neutrality
    law except as to certain features and return to the broad basis of
    International law which supposedly governed our international relations
    until the Neutrality act was passed in 1935 He went back to 1809 and cited
    the Embargo act o f President Jefferson as to the point President Jefferson
    obtained an Embargo act to keep our country out o f the war between Napoleon
    and Great Britain Eventually the War o f 1812 followed and the President
    mentioned the burning o f our capitol by the British troops in 1814 as one o
    f the results o f President Jefferson s embargo law He claimed that to
    continue the embargo provisions o f our Neutrality law might serve to again
    get us into a foreign conflict He suggested that our unemployment question
    might be relieved to some extent by permitting our industries to make and
    ship the implements o f war in finished form instead o f merely permitting
    the shipments of materials which could be similarly fabricated by the
    nations obtaining them Profits from such a traffic might be regulated by law
    at the regular session o f congress in January should it be found that our
    munition and war implement makers were profiting exorbitantly The president
    said that he was sorry that Congress passed the Neutrality act in 1935 and
    that he also was sorry that he signed the measure Possibly he overlooked the
    fact that it was an administration bill when it was introduced and that it
    was offered to prevent congress going hay wire as some expressed it at the
    time and passing a far more stringent neutrality measure which might have
    served as a broad embargo act which possibly would have been as stringent as
    the non intercourse act passed in Jefferson s administration The President
    following repeal o f the Embargo provision wants a cash and carry plan re
    enacted so that all shipments o f arms munitions and war implements must be
    made in ships o f the country which makes the purchases and only after cash
    is paid for what is bought possibly with the same provision applying to all
    shipments to warring countries including foodstuffs cotton and materials of
    which war stuffs are made In that way the danger o f our own shipping being
    attacked or captured by submarines or other vessels o f any of the countries
    at war might be obviated Leaving to Congress the matter of law as to non
    embargo and cash and carry he would have Congress permit the chief executive
    to govern by order or proclamation the matter o f our own citizens traveling
    on ships o f belligerent nations during war He would also and in the same
    manner regulate our ships entering warzones even though traveling to or from
    neutral countries With submarines abroad in nearly all the seas and oceans
    it might be a bit difficult to determine just what and where a war zone
    might be Reverting to International law in all except the specific
    provisions which he would leave in or have included in the Neutrality act
    would place in the hands o f the President the general policy o f neutrality
    just as it was in 1914 to 1917 when our neutrality was ended by entering the
    conflict abroad International law is a wonderful system upon which the
    experts disagree and which most folks know little about One modem compendium
    is o f four volumes o f about 1 000 pages each There are others with even
    more pages The President conceded that there are wide differences o f
    opinion as to our Neutrality law and the proposal to repeal the embargo
    feature He generously admitted that opposite views upon the questions might
    be held by people equally patriotic and ambitious to keep our country out o
    f war and asked that his own views in the matter might be given as generous
    consideration as he would accord to those who disagree with him He said our
    great issue was to keep out o f war Following the reading o f the message
    congress adjourned until Monday The present plan o f the leaders is to have
    the Senate take up the question first and have the House adjourn in three
    day periods until the Senate has acted How long the session may last cannot
    be foretold If no other legislation is taken up adjournment may come in a
    month But with important legislation pending in both houses such as those
    for dairying and farm debt relief why the House should stall around in
    recess much o f the time while the Senate does its talking does not seem
    just nor reasonable MERLIN HULL ACTIVITIES IN RURAL SCHOOLS OF THE COUNTY
    The county schools are well underway and the work for the year as outlined
    in the offices o f the County Superintendent Grace Webb has a good start

    Specialist as leader A new chairman was elected at this time otherwise o
    fficers hold as before At this meeting we studied candlewicking bedrooms
    suited to the family Swedish drawn work and a fancy stitch for towels Among
    the quaint and old things we have received for the decoration o f our homes
    is the embroidery known as candle wicking This art handed down through
    generations fits in perfectly due to its texture beauty and economy with our
    early American furniture and hand made rugs The stitch is easily made and
    easy to launder in fact the tufts grow more beautiful with use and
    laundering This pioneer art originated when the mountain women o f Georgia
    mended coverlets with wicking that was usually dipped in wax for candle
    making New England used the same idea with woollen yarn Candlewicking was
    originally used for bedspreads only but may also be used on couch or chair
    cushions curtains or draperies slip covers dresser scarfs and also for
    decorating smocks and dresses Unbleached or dyed sheeting colored chambray
    osnaburg or heavy flour sacks natural color or dyed white or colored candle
    wick yard 12 ply Use a very heavy darning needle or large needle with a flat
    end The use o f the bedroom will vary in different families It is largely
    determined by the size o f the family the number and size o f the other
    rooms in the house A bedroom that is well supplied with heat can be used for
    purposes other than sleep and thus relieve crowded conditions in other rooms

    column if we had one and we often feel that we should have one could come
    this week the fact that Joe Gernert o f Alma Center found a patch o f
    Blueberries near his home and picked a half case They were nice solid
    berries and the first he had ever found in September Whether a late variety
    or one that was delayed in maturing this year he does not know but the find
    was just as welcome as if he did Miss Lila Johnson county nurse gives us a
