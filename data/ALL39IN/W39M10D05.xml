FORTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 5. 1939 NUMBER 47
Last Tax E ffort
Establishing a new record for the
longest session in tho history of the
state, the 1939 legislature was back in
Madison again this week in a last effort
to enact a revenue measure to
provide funds to carry the state
through the 1939-40 biennium.
The legislature after convening
Tuesday had been in session a total
of 266 days which is four days longer
than the record session made by the
Progressive 1935 legislature. Then
too, if ami when the legislature does
adjourn, it is possible that they will
do so without enacting sufficient tax
measures to balance the state’s budget.
Thus far a two cent per package
cigarette tax, reenactment of the 60
per cent surtax, and reenactment of
the 3 per cent dividends tax are the
only tax measures that have been
adopted. The tax proposals discarded
increased wine and liquor taxes, increased
income taxes, estate taxes,
sales taxes, gross income taxes, more
lucrative chain store tax, music machine
taxes, lubricating oil tax, theaer
tax, an occupational tax on gasoline.
and diversion of highway money.
The assembly has passed two tax
measures and the senate one (aside
from those already enacted into law),
but the two houses have been unable
to agree with each other. More than
that, Republicans as a whole have fa iled
to agree and the coalition of Democrats
and Republicans differs substantially
when it comes to levying
new taxes.
Governor H eil Appeals
Governor Heil last week made n
personal appeal to Republicans in
caucus and conferences to enact additional
tax measures before they adjourn.
The Governor stated that the
state treasury was in a precarious condition
and that if no money was forthcoming,
legislative emploves faced
payless pay days after Christmas if
not before.
Asking for the enactment of a gross
income tax of M of 1 per cent, the
Governor assured Repubicans that he
would be personally responsible for it.
He told senators and assemblymen if
its passage endangered them politically
in their respective voting areas
that he would come to their aid and
campaign for them. He asked them!
not to concern themselves with thc re-!
action of business in Wisconsin to the
pronosed tax because “I will take care
of that.”
The Governor is also renorted to
have told Republicans that he would
be reelected in 1940 by a larger majority
than before.
On Friday Senator Young of Milwaukee,
chairman of the joint house
committee on pensions also urged that
some sort of a revenue bill be passed.
Senator Young expressed the fear
that failure to provide sufficient funds
for old age assistance would endanger
the state’s share of federal funds for
that purpose.
The Gross Income Tax
Before adjourning for the week end
recess the senate had put in two chaotic
days in an attempt to put through
a gross income tax estimated to yield
12 million dollars for the biennium.
The bill has already been killed twice
and both times by votes of the Lieutenant
Governor, Walter Goodland
(The Lieutenant Governor votes only I
in case of ties). It has been revived
twice by reconsideration votes and a'
the senators adjourned the bill was
receiving amendments prior to its
third vote for adoption.
The new bill, patterned after the
Indiana law. proposes to tax all income
by retailers, wholesalers, jobbers,
manufacturers, professional
men, wage earners, and all income received
through interest dividends and
rents. The tax rate for all classes
would be % of 1 per cent with a $1000
exemption for all with the exception
of retail merchants, who would be
granted a $2,000 exemption. Before
adjourning Friday the senate h»d
adopted an amendment exempting
farmers completely from the tax.
Chief opposition to the hill has been
that it is in everything but name a
sales tax in that all taxes on the retailer,
wholesaler, or any other business
must be passed on to the consumer.
Goodland. who on several occasions
before has disagreed with the
administration, believes that the legislature
should adjourn and come hack
in special session after a committee
has worked during the interim on tax
proposals.
A resolution asking the legislature
to recess until October 31 has been
introduced by Senator White. There
have been four resolutions to date
asking for a sine die adjournment, but
as yet none have been put to vote.
C igare tte Tax Cash
While the legislature puzzles over
new taxes, the one new state tax enacted
is ringing a merry tune on the
state treasurer’s cash register. Receipts
from the new tax on cigarettes,
cigarette papers and cigarette tubes
totalled more than $300,000 during the
first ten days it was in effect, Chief
John W. Roach of the beverage tax
division reported. *
Roach pointed out that all retailers
who failed to report before October 1
the amount of taxable tobacco products
they had on hand at midnight,
September 19, when the tax went into
effect, are subject to a 15 per cent
penalty. Retailers were required to
make two notarised copies of these inventories,
one to be kept by them and
one to be sent to the division with a
check covering the tax.
Stamps denoting that the tax has
been paid have been distributed to
wholesalers and retailers. There are
22 meters in circulation which ink the
official stamp on cigarette packages,
and 40 more meters will soon be available.
C apitol Notes
Republicans favoring the reorganization
of the public service commission
have an uphill battle on their
hands. Although the measure has
been passed, a reconsideration vote
has been delayed by a slim one and
two vote margin by the opponents.
The fifty cents cane fishing pole
license bill has been killed by the senate.

SCHOOL NEWS
School C arniv al F riday, Oct. 27
For an evening full of fun, frolic
and frivolity make your plans now to
attend the school carnival which will
be held October 27th in the public
school building. School carnivals have
been held a number of times in the
past and have always proven to be one
of the outstanding events of the school
year. A certain amount of money is
necessary to carry on the extra activities
of the school and it is hoped that
this carnival will provide this necessary
revenue.
Mr. Korting has been appointed
general chairman for the affair and
will outline a very extensive program
to be presented to the public. A main
show, several side shows, concessions,
parades, games of skill, and a jitney
dance comprise some of the entertainment
to be offered. All students from
kindergarten through high school will
have some part in the program and
their success depends upon the support
of every one interested in the
school.
No School Friday
The teachers will attend the Central
Wisconsin Teachers convention to be
held in Wausau on Friday of this
week. They have chosen the district
rather than the state convention because
the attendance at the latter has
increased to a point where Milwaukee
has neither the hotel nor auditorium
facilities to accommodate them. The
district organizations have been improving
their programs to such an
extent that the talent appearing on
their general program is equal to that |
of the State convention.
Basketball Begins Monday
Tournament time has been moved
ahead to the 3rd week in February
with inter-school games beginning one
week earlier than in previous years.
The first game will be about Nov. 10.
The new Gymnasium will allow one
month of practice before the first
game. Thus W'ittenberg should have
a good team to put on the floor at that
time. Two letter men, Alex Derrow
and Carl Voelz, have been lost by
graduation but several likely looking
boys have moved in to help fill this
'~*n. All boys are urged to avail
themselves of the Wisconsin intersch^
tpstic accident benefit plan. Boys
takinT part in inter school contests
will be required to file their permit
cards in the Principal’s office. This
plan protects the boy whether an injury
occurs on the play ground, in a
gym class or an inter-school game
providing such play is under supervisor.
Gymnasium Schedule
Working on the assumption that a
good mind will function better in a
round body every boy and girl in t
school w’ill be required to spend two j
periods per week in the gym or on the
play ground participating in a supervised
athletic program. The kindergarten.
first and second grades will
use the gym in the forenoon. The
afternoon will be divided to provide
for the rest of the school. Students 1
will be excused only on written request
from their parents or family
physician.
Band Schedule Change
Because the gym is to be used for
athletic purposes during the afternoon
and because the stage of the gym
provides the most suitable place for
rehearsal, for the present, the band
will meet from 8:15 to 9:00 a. m., instead
of after school.
Wisconsin College of the Air
The radio is now recognized as a
vital aid to enrichening the curriculum,
and the receiver is an essential part
of the modern school’s equipment.
An attempt is being made to equip
one or tw’o rooms in the school with a
radio so that the various grades and
.•losses may listen to some of the timely
programs that are now made available
during the school day.
The following programs are being
broadcast at the present time: A detailed

Local Puppet Show Is to
Be Broadcast on Friday
Miss Gertrude Hoffman, home demonstration
leader in Shawano county,
will take Mrs. E. W. Sihler and Mrs.
A. H. Maack, of this village, to Madison
tomorrow (Friday). At 10:00
o’clock the latter two will broadcast at
the Madison station the puppet showentitled
“Love Is Victorious Over All.”
A descriptive account of the show
follows:
Sixty years ago, Amelia Schust,
rummaging in the attic of her parents’
home in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, found on
the back of an old German calendar a
very amusing play, using puppets for
the actors. Making the puppets was
very simple as the heads were made of
potatoes hollowed to fit the index finger,
and a large handkerchief wrapped
around the hand furnished the clothing.
Thumb and middle-finger furnished
arms for the puppet. Amelia and
her sisters often performed their play
for their friends. One who thoroughly
enjoyed the performance was the son
of the pastor of St. Paul’s church in
Ft. Wayne. Years later, when he was
a professor of German at Luther College,
Decorah, Iowa, and Amelia was
his wife, he translated the little German
play into English for his children.
Many's the time the Sihler children
have given the puppet show for their
friends. As far as we know, Dr. Sihler’s
translation of “ Love H Victorious
Over A ll” is the only English version
of this amusing German comedy.

A Vagabond Song:
There is something in the autumn
that is native to my blood—
Touch of manner, hint of mood;
And my heart is like a rhyme.
With the yellow and the purple and
the crimson keeping time.
The scarlet of the maples can shake
me like a cry
O f bugles going by.
And my lovely spirit thrills
To see the frosty asters like smoke
upon the hills.
There is something in October sets
the gypsy blood astir;
We must rise and follow her.
When from every hill of flame
She calls and calls each vagabond
by name.
— Bliss Carman.
# * *
During these glorious autumn days
no poem we have ever read quite so
completely expresses our feelings as
does Bliss Carman’s “Vagabond
Song.” Every hill and every valley,
every street and every lane hold a riot
of gold, scarlet and russet beauty
these days. Across the river from the
Orphan’s Home is a scene we especially
love. The grove of trees covering
a knoll remind us of a grand march—
a wonderfully beautiful grand march
— with the crimson maples and golden
poplars like fair ladies in party frocks
accompanied by their tall, dark, and
dignified escorts, the pine, the spruce,
and the hemlock.
Have you happened to see the
avenue of maples beyond the lower
Old People’s Home? Adjectives are
trite and even the superlative is weak
before such gorgeous color! Nearly
every yard, though bereft o f flowers,
has one spot of glorious beauty—a
flaming tree. Ah indeed—
“There is something in the autumn
that is native to my blood—
Touch of manner, hint of mood;
And my heart is like a rhyme
W’ith the yellow and the purple and
the crimson keeping time.”

Harris and Ferrell Dexter.
“T. T." Trouble
Governor Heil who has had plenty
of tax trouble the past three months
has another T- Trouble, that of Turkeys.
A few weeks ago the Governor was
chided because a Minnesota turkey
raiser announced to a local newspaper
that he had received an order from
the Governor of Wisconsin for 100
turkeys for a state banquet.
Wisconsin turkey raisers fretted.
Wasn’t this the same Governor who a
few short months ago attempted to
set up milk shops on Milwaukee’s Wisconsin
avenue for the benefit of the
Wisconsin farmers?
Attaches in the Governor’s office
now explain that it all was a big mistake
and the result of publicity zeal.
They claim, and prove with telegrams
and letters, that a Milwaukee Produce
company ordered turkeys for a banquet
fr.»m a Minnesota concern and
while telephoning the order stated,
“ And the turkeys had better be good,
the Governor's ‘gonna’ be there.”
The Governor and Turkeys made the
news before. A few months ago Heil
decided that President Roosevelt could
move Thanksgiving Day ahead «ne
week if he cared to, but that in Wisconsin
the turkey would reign as before
on the last Thursday in November.

agricultural Russia getting more

nothing to indicate this split-up

and Russia had become fast
friends and were upsetting every
applecart in eastern Europe.
Except for Warsaw’s heroic resistance,

trouble. Pro-Nazi Iron Guardists in
R um an ia assassinated Premier Arm
and Calinescu and a reign of terror
began as his successor executed
hundreds of other Iron Guardists as
an object lesson. Under sim ilar conditions
of internal strife, other nations
(Austria and Czecho-Slovakia)
had been invaded by Germany.
While Germany turned her eyes
westward, Russia closed the Neva
river and thus stopped export of F in nish
lumber to England (because
cellulose, essential in gunpowder,
comes from woodpulp). Next the
K rem lin was host to a flock of visitors,
including little Esthonia’s Foreign
Minister K arl Setler who found
his nation under big Russia’s thumb.
L atv ia and Lithuania also watched,
because Russia covets the Baltic
sea outlet which any of these three
nations could give her. Another early
arrival was Turkey’s Foreign
Minister Sukru Saracoglu, indicating
increased Soviet sway over the
Black sea. Yugo-Slavia and Hungary
were rumored anxious to restore
diplomatic relations, for the
Krem lin was definitely in eastern
Europe's saddle.
At Spa
After nearly a month of war, the
score on losses stood at 29 British
ships, one French, nine Germ an and j
nine neutral. Scandinavian nations |
began suffering as two Swedish and
two Finnish boats (both carrying
woodpulp to England) were torpedoed
by Germany. Miscellany at

C The Polish liner Batory was
placed in Canadian service as a m u nitions

C A U. S. Mediterranean destroyer,

C Germany announced sinking an

In the West
As a construction crew works
harder when the boss is watching,
so did Germ any’s arm y put its
shoulder to the western front when
Der Fuehrer and Col.-Gen. Walther
von Brauchitsch arrived from Poland.
Gone was the last chance for
peace (See V A R OF WORDS) and
the lethargic fighting of earlier
weeks developed into serious w arfare.
Though French-English troops
repulsed the Nazi sorties staged for
Adolf Hitler’s benefit, the real battle
was yet to come when G e rm a ny’s
70 divisions arrived from Poland.
Seizing time by the forelock, B ritish
and French planes reportedly
bombed the Friedrichshafen Zeppelin
works and pounded their way
right up to the m ain Siegfried line.
W a r o f Words
Biggest revelation of the week
was B ritain’s “ blue book” on prewar
diplomacy, showing that A m bassador
Sir Nevile Henderson had
been warned on August 16 that Russia
would join the Reich in partitioning
Poland. This disposed nicely
of the Soviet excuse that she had
marched to protect Poland’s Ukrainians
and White Russians.
Biggest propaganda news was the
British announcement that G e rm any’s
“ freedom” radio station was
active again, urging people to desert
Herr Hitler.
But the biggest word battle of
all was found between Rome and
London. To Bologna Fascist leaders,
Dictator Mussolini pointed out
that Poland was “ liquidated” and
that the justification for war was
therefore ended.
Next day a British spokesman reiterated
Prime Minister's earlier
recitation of B ritain’s war aim : “ To
redeem Europe from the perpetual
fear of German aggression.” 11
Duce’s peace feeler had failed.

Undiplomatic as happy kids who
know a secret are U. S. business
men who stand to profit from South
American trade expansion during
the European war. In late September,
while 22 American nations met
at P anam a City to weld their friendship
and neutrality, there was much
bustling among tradesmen in New
York and Washington.
The National Economic and Social
Planning association said the
U. S. stands to gain “ tremendously”
in Latin-American trade, but was
wise enough to warn that expansion
must proceed on the “ basic principle
that the only justifiable purpose
. . . is to benefit all concerned.”
Next day American Express
company’s Lynde Selden announced
his firm was opening a
chain of Latin-American offices to
help the U. S. in a boom trade he
expected would reach nearly $300,-
000,000 a year.
Gone are the days of U. S. “ dollar
diplomacy” in Central and South
America, a policy which reaped as
much ill will as it did profits. But
there is every indication that Eu-

rope's new war will indeed bring a
trade boom, moreover that U. S.
profits this time will be instigated
just as solidly by our southern
neighbors as “ dollar diplomacy’s”
profits were instigated by American
profiteers.
This turning of tables was obvious
at P a n am a City. First off, the conference
talked about neutrality and
a 300-mile defense network around
the entire hemisphere, in which belligerent
activities would be banned.
But U. S Undersecretary of State
Sumner Welles drew just as much
attention as neutrality. While longhostile
Argentina was negotiating a
reciprocal trade treaty in Washington,
Undersecretary Welles was kept
busy explaining why his country
could not arrange more financial aid
like it recently extended to Haiti,
Nicaragua. Paraguay and Brazil.
Reason: Congress' failure to pass
the lend-spend bill. Thus the Export-
Import bank, which financed
Brazil’s recent purchase of 14
freighters, could not underwrite a
sim ilar bid from Chile.
Though he bore no gifts. Undersecretary
Welles could go back
home with a pretty good idea of the
job and opportunity confronting the
U. S. in Pan-America relations: To
“ carry” its economically strapped
markets until world markets are
restored to normal.

Strange bedfellows and cockeyed

pleas for “ an adjournment of politics”
as congress got its teeth into
Franklin Roosevelt’s neutrality
problem. The argument: Should the
arms embargo (barring munition
sales to belligerents) be replaced
by “ cash-and-carry,” under which
warring nations could buy and carry
off (in their own ships) anything
they wanted? A Gallup poll showed
57 per cent of the U. S. favored
“ cash-and-carry,” but that didn't

WASHINGTON.—There were three
big reasons why President Roosevelt
reluctantly called congress into
special session at this time, instead
of postponing the call until much
later, as he had hoped.
The three reasons, in the order
named, were Russia, Italy, and a
group of senators including notably
W illiam E. Borah of Idaho, Arthur
H. Vandenberg of Michigan and
Arthur Capper of Kansas.
Russia and Italy figured for obvious
reasons. Russian troops have
invaded Poland. Nobody
knows what
she plans to do—
how far her agreements
with Hitler
will carry her. Italy
is neutral, but prepared
for war up to
the hilt. The British
and French are trying
their best not
only to keep her
from joining G erm any,
but to bring her
in on their side. This last is not so
m uch for the assistance Italian soldiers
would render, but to provide
an open path through which Ihe
British and French could attack
Germany, thus short-circuiting the
Siegfried line, and also to prevent
the flowing of food and supplies into
Germany. This last is vital because
the British and French governments
are counting on eventual victory
through strangulation more than
m ilitary triumphs.
The biggest single factor which
could be brought to play on both
Russia and Ita ly , obviously, would
be some convincing evidence that,
in the long run, Germ any must certainly
be defeated. Anything which
convinced either Stalin or Mussolini
of that would be sure to keep
Stalin neutral, and to induce Mussolini
to play along with London and
Paris.
Obviously, also, a very potent factor
in convincing Stalin and Mussolini
of this would be a forceful demonstration
that the United States
was so strongly on the side of Britain
and France that it would take
only a little push to bring this country
into the war on their side.

Roosevelt disliked the idea of an
extra session, at flrst, because he
feared speeches would be made
which would misrepresent this picture—
would do a great deal of
harm , in fact, in their effect on the
European situation. He dreaded the
idea of long tirades, m aking frontpage
headlines in Berlin, Rome and
Moscow, by such senators as Gerald
P. Nye, Borah and Vandenberg.
But—Borah, Nye, Vandenberg and
Capper burst out on the front pages
of the country’s newspapers anyhow,
with strong statements which
were represented in Rome, Berlin
and Moscow not as minority views,
but as the platform of the political
party in the United States which
probably would win the next election!
Which removed the objection to
the extra session, and intensified
the reasons justifying it.
R e p e a l o f A r m s E m b a r g o
D e s i r e d E a r l y a s P o s s i b l e
There is ho way, so far as can
be seen at present, to prevent a
very long debate in the upper chamber.
This is important, both to the adm
inistration and to business. The
White House is anxious that business
men in general, and prospective
manufacturers of guns, am m u nition,
airplanes, etc., in particular,
should be sure of fairly speedy
repeal as soon as possible. The
point here is to prevent a wholesale
exodus of capital seeking such war
profits to Canada.
The President’s interest in this is,
strangely enough, in line with his
general interest for years, in the
workers rather than in the capitalists
who employ them—or, as the
capitalists involved would say—who
provide the jobs for the W’orkers.
As the administration sees the picture
the obvious course for a capitalist
interested in setting about the
manufacture of arms, amm unition,
airplanes or anything else on the
embargoed list, would be to have a
plant constructed right here—provided—
he was sure the embargo
would be lifted speedily.
Otherwise, that obvious thing for
that capitalist to do would be to
build a plant in Canada, where he
would be sure of a friendly government,
no restrictions on his exports,
all sorts of concessions, such as priority
for his shipments of material,
and a firm policy by the government
against any strike tending to
slow down his production.
So the capitalist, the White House
figures, might be even better off
if he did move to Canada. But
American workmen would not be.
For obviously in Canada idle Canadian
workers would have first call.
Their government would see to that.
Wants Capital to Confine
Operations to United States
The other side of the picture, and
one that the President wants
stressed, is that the capitalist in
question would be m uch better off
in the days to come if he confines
his operations to the United States
and thus gives employment and buying
power to this country. This is
true, the White House believes,
whether the United States should
later become involved in the war or
not.
If the United States remains neutral,
there is no doubt about it.
Certainly, as Canada gives more
and more aid to B ritain in the war,
she njust raise taxes, even on visiting
munition makers. Much of
the profits will thus be lost through
war taxes.
Also, it is pointed out, what is
to be done with the plant after
peace finally comes? If the plant is
inside the United States, inside our
customs barriers, there will be an
incomparably greater opportunity to
turn it to some peacetime occupation
that will be profitable. This
problem w ill be tough enough, anyhow,
as many production industries
not connected with “ arms, am m u nition
and implements of w a r” will
encounter a sharp letdown at that
time. Presumably Europe will begin
a feverish competition to regain
its markets, lost for the duration of
the war, in Latin America and elsewhere
in the world, which the United
States will have been supplying.
S e n a t o r B r i d g e s I s O u t f o r
P r e s i d e n t i a l N o m i n a t i o n
Sen. H. Styles Bridges of New
H ampshire is the most active candidate
for the presidential nomination
in any party, if one is to judge by
the mass of boosting m ate rial received
by newspapers and m agazines
from his publicity bureau. Oldtimers
are unable to remember any
candidate who was ever nominated
by that route, but every now and
then there is an interesting point,
and one with merit, in the Bridges
handouts.
For instance, a dissertation on the
notion that a m an must come from
a big, pivotal state
in order to have a
chance. The Bridges
press agents riddle
this hoary political
m ax im very effectively.
They are perfectly
right that
state pride, on which
politicians count so
much, functions only
spasmodically when
it comes to delivering
electoral votes.
The Bridges press agents fail to
mention it, but it actually did deliver
electoral votes if one goes back
to 1896. In that year the Democratic
national convention defied the
big pivotal state notion and named
W'illiam Jennings Bryan as its candidate.
Bryan was crushingly defeated,
of course, but he did carry
his own state of Nebraska, with
eight electoral votes.
However, when he ran again, in
1900, McKinley carried it. The tide
was too strong, just as it was too
strong in 1936 for Alfred M. Lan-
' don to carry his own small state of
! Kansas, which seemed to be seeth-
; mg with state pride during the cam-
! paign.
Nor did the addition of “ Brother
I Charlie” Bryan to the Democratic
national ticket in 1924, for second
place, result in Nebraska’s going for
Davis and Bryan. It went overwhelmingly
for Coolidge, as did
West Virginia, the birthplace and
political background of John W. D avis,
head of the ticket.
S o m e M o r e E x a m p l e s O u t
O f t h e P o l i t i c a l P a s t
New York state voted heavily for
Alfred E. Smith, giving h im prodigious
majorities when he was running
for governor, every tim e at
least except in 1920. when the H arding
landslide pulled h im down. In
that election he ran 1,000,000 votes
ahead of his ticket, but was beaten.
Yet when he ran for President in
1928 New York gave its electoral
votes to Herbert Hoover by a sm all
but safe m ajority.
The truth is that politically New
York has little state pride. It is
almost too big to care. There is
no such feeling as exists in some of
the smaller states where the local
boy who has made good is regarded,
frequently, as a neighbor. Pennsylvania,
up to 1934. was so heavily Republican
that neither party thought
of looking there for a candidate.
Yet the late Philander C. Knox
would have been nominated for
President by the Republicans if H iram
W. Johnson had been willing to
run with him as vice president! In
which event Johnson would have
been President, for Knox died shortly
thereafter.
One has to skip the next state in
electoral strength, Illinois, and get
down to Ohio to find real local pride.
There is plenty of that in the Buckeye
state, but also plenty of bitterness
as between factions, as when
enemies of Warren G. Harding
fought him so bitterly in the p rim a ries
that they captured some delegates
for Leonard Wood, and when
enemies of Sen. F rank B. Willis, in
1928, fought him when he was trying
to land the delegation to the
convention that named Hoover.

THE STORY THUS FAB
C a p ta in C a rl Norwood has been sent from his n ativ e E n g la n d to the K a d u r
R iv e r d istrict in In d ia , alo ng with his Indispensable m a n serv a n t. Moses O 'L e a ry ,
soldier of fortune. Norwood's Job is to survey the d istrict to d ete rm ine whether
a v a lua b le secret d iam o n d m in e belongs to the tem p le priests or to the ru ler, the
M a h a r a ja h of K a d u r. Norwood calls on the B ritish Residency to pay h is in itia l
respects. On hts way he catches a g lim pse of two women in a p a lace c arriag e,

Lynn laughed: “ That’s a testimonial
for me! But thank you, I ’ll take
care of A unty.”
“ No,” said the doctor. He caught
R u n d h ia ’s eye. Rundhia came to
his rescue and made signals to the
Maharanee, who wanted nothing
better than to have Lynn under her
own roof.
“ Lynn, dear, please do as the doctor
tells you. Please, please.”
Aunty groaned and protested that
it was a shame to inflict Lynn on the
Maharanee, but she was overruled.
She was carried out on an improvised
litter and rushed to the guesthouse,
where Lynn’s belongings
were collected by the servants and
conveyed to the palace.
C H A PT ER V
Rundhia was puzzled and Lynn
knew it. She enjoyed it. It was
cool and beautiful beneath the moonlit
trees in the garden.
“ You are the strangest m ixtiye of
intelligence and innocence that I
have ever met,” said Rundhia. “ You
are in love with all this. You are
thrilled by the exotic strangeness.
But it’s all old stuff to me, remember.
I ’m a babe in the woods, too,
in a certain sense. I ’m as lost as
you are. T h in g s and places don’t
make life worth living. I t ’s the people
in the places, and the things
they do together. If you loved me
and I loved you—”
“ But neither of us does,” Lynn interrupted.
“ We are East and West.
Europe delights you because you
ca n ’t ever really understand it. And
the East enraptures me for the same
reason.”
“ So we’ve that much in common,’*
said Rundhia. “ Let me tell you
something else we have in common.
We like each other.”
“ Do we?”
“ Yes. One would have to be blind,
deaf, demented, not to like you.
W h at’s wrong with m e ? ”
Lynn’s defensive tactic was a
thousand times more shrewd than
Aunty would dream of giving her
credit for:
“ Well, for instance, why do you
dislike Captain Norwood?”
“ For the same reason that he
doesn’t like m e,” said Rundhia.
“ Cherchez la femme. Thank the
father and mother who bred him,
he’s only an Engineer. If he were
Cavalry, I m igh t feel jealous. Lynn,
I love you.”
“ How many women have you said
that to?”
“ Hundreds. But I lied to all the
others.”
“ I have sometimes had to lie to
Aunty. But I ’m not nearly as practiced
a liar as you must be. Let’s
be truthful.”
“ I am telling you the truth. I
have always thought myself a cynic.
I d idn’t know I had a heart until I
met you. I have found and lost it
in the same moment. It is yours.
What will you do with it? ”
His arm crept around her. He
hardly knew how she slipped away
from him. She waltzed away. She
ran along the path, her arms extended
to embrace the moonlit
luxury of hue and view and perfumed
flowers. By the time he overtook
her, her retort was ready:
“ Perhaps you don’t like men with
red h a ir? ”
“ I am looking,” he answered, " a t
your hair. I want to bury my hands
in it, bathe my face in it, breathe
the—”
“ Borax! I washed it and the water’s
te rrib le !”
She escaped him again. Her black
p a jam a s vanished into shadow; she
became a beautiful, disembodied
head in a golden aureole that asked:
“ Is Captain Norwood married? I
d id n ’t ask h im .”
“ Well, why didn’t you ask h im ? ”
“ I didn’t care.’’
“ G ood!” said Rundhia. “ I ’m going
to m ake you care about something
else. Come along. I ’ll behave.
Come this way.”
He led her up steps to the top of
the ancient garden wall. There was
a summerhouse on the wall, a sort
of kiosk; it had been swept and
provided with cushions by a servant
who crouched in shadow. Rundhia
ordered the servant away. He went
and lurked at the foot of the steps,
but Rundhia shouted at him and he
fled. Rundhia led Lynn into the
open-sided kiosk.
“ You have promised,” she said,
•'to behave.”
“ Do you believe m e n’s promises
when they’re in love? Are you as
naive as tha t?”
“ Yes. Don’t be silly. Let us look
• t the view.”
“ Look at m e .”
His eyes were hardly less fiery
than the glowing end of his cigarette.
They made L ynn’s flesh tingle.
He threw away the cigarette.
“ Lynn, you romantic girl, this
scene enchants you because love
has stolen on you unaware. Neither
of us until now has ever known
what love is.”
“ Do you think you know now?”
she retorted.
“ You know I know it. You are
cruel.”
“ I wish you’d sit farther away,”
she interrupted. “ Why don’t you
make love«to your own countrywomen?”
“ There isn’t in all In d ia such a
lovely girl as you are.”
“ How do you know? It ’s true, isn’t
it, that most of them are kept in
seclusion and you're not allowed to
see them? Is that why you make
love to me? Why not burgle a zena
na?”
“ Lynn,” he said, “ I don’t make
love. I am love. And you also. We
are love itself, as a m usician becomes
music. Why waste the glorious
hours?”
“ What do you know about m usic?”
she retorted. “ Can you sing
Indian songs?”
“ Yes, love songs! I play the guita
r.”
“ You can? What fun! Why not
get it? There couldn’t be a more
'Hello!” he remarked.
perfect place for singing than this
garden wall in moonlight.”
R undhia sensed that he had cast
his fly too boldly. She wasn’t hooked.
She needed more subtle persuasion.
He shouted to the servant to fetch
the guitar. There was no answer;
the servant had taken him too strictly
at his word, he was out of earshot.
Rundhia shouted again and
again. He swore under his breath.
Then he governed his anger and
smiled at Lynn:
“ Will you wait here if I go and
get it? ”
“ Yes, but—”
“ W hat?”
“ You look murderous. Don’t whip
the servant!”
His undercover m an was waiting
for him in the usual place, by the
gate in the wall that separated the
M a ha raja h ’s palace from R u nd h ia’i
—an unimportant-looking but peculiarly
unmeek Hindu, who spoke in
a low voice without preliminary gestures
of respect:
“ The priests have learned of Captain
Norwood’s arrival. They sent
me to speak with his Eurasian spy,
O ’Leary, who is a reptile. O ’Leary
has already detected the opening of
the m ine.”
Rundhia thought swiftly, and
spoke slowly: “ Go and tell the
priests that Captain Norwood is here
to line his own pocket. Say he is
in debt and seeks an opportunity to
pay his debts. His secret report
will be in favor of the highest bidder.
But don’t, say you heard it
from me. Say O'Leary was drunk
and you heard it from him. Make
it perfectly clear to the priests that
any other officer than Norwood
would be scrupulously fair, so let
them think about it.”
Then Rundhia founa a servant in
the garden of his own palace and
sent him running to fetch the guitar.
ace wall, riding slowly because the
sais was following on foot. He had
ridden about fifty yards to a curve
in the road when O ’Leary stepped
forth from a shadow. He d id n’t look
like O ’Leary. He was wearing a
turban, and dressed like a dripping
wet, dirty Hindu of no caste or ostensible
occupation. Norwood drew
rein and listened, watching *the road
for pedestrians.
“ I d idn’t stable the mare in the
city. She’s back in camp. I ’ll need
her later.”
“ What for?”
“ As soon as I ’m dressed decent
again, I ’ll go back to the bazaar. I
told a y am about coming back to
cam p for more money. I ’m going
to need it.”
“ What happened?”
“ Plenty. I was right about Noor
Mahlam. They’ve ditched him . So
I did too. He was only ground bait.
He talked too much, then tried to
have me knifed to stop me talking.
They’d a trap set for me and I
w’alked straight into it. A woman.
I ’ll tell you about her later; she’d
fill a dictionary.”
“ Never mind about the woman.
What happened?”
“ Nothing happened there. It
couldn’t. I left your m are tied up
to the veranda railing, m ilitary
saddle and all, and your initials on
the bridle. So they couldn’t take
chances. And I could. And I d id .”
“ That’s enough about you. What
happened?”
“ Kindergarten stuff. Confidence
game. The wom an’s bully flattered
me I knew the woman’s sister in
Lahore, and he said the woman’s
sister’d given me a rep for being
smarter than most, and a m an o’
m y word. Then he introduced me to
th f woman. She’s all honey and poison.
Sister my eye. Two words,
and I knew she was lying about
that.”
“ Never m ind her lies, or whose
sister she is. How much truth did
she tell you?”
“ Not much, barring that I ’m the
most exciting m an she’d ever seen.
She was true enough excited, so I
knew the bully was listening in; and
he weren’t her proper bully neither;
he W'as someone who’d been
rung in on her, and she scared o’
h im and not used to his ways. She
said there’d be a thousand rupees
for me if I ’d act discreet.”
“ Whose thousand rupees?” asked
Norwood.
“ Trust your Moses O ’Leary. I
asked her that quick. She said it
was Prince R u nd h ia’s thousand rupees.
So I knew it wasn’t.”
“ What does she want you to do?”
“ She told me a mess o' lies about
Prince Rundhia having quarrelled
with the temple Brahmins, and him
wanting to get back at ’em, to spite
’em. She told me, and I acted surprised,
that there’s a diamond mine
in the temple area. There’s a thousand
rupees for me if I persuade
you to run your survey line slap
through the temple area, so that
the mine will belong to the M aharajah
instead of the temple priests.”
“ What did you tell h e r?”
“ I said you re easy, but you’re
honest. I said I ’ll have to find some
way of artfully deceiving you if
you’re to do w hat’s needed. I said
I ’d have to look into it, and I made
her tell me where the mine is and
how to get a look at it. She came
clean.”
“ How did she know?”
“ She’d been told. And she was
out of her depth already. She wanted
word with the bully, and she
tried to get me to stay where I
was. But I thought of the bay mare
standing outside in the alley, and
she fidgety, and you fond o' the
mare and liable to find fault with me
if she should come to harm . And I
guessed it ’ud be wise to look into
tha woman’s story first.”
You’d better leave that woman
and her bully guessing, and show
me the mine. Wnere is it? ”
O ’Leary pointed: “ Two hours
from now, when the moon’s about
there, 1 can guide you to a place
where you can see along under the
apron of water.”
“ Very well, O ’Leary. Which way
did you come?”
“ Short cut. Don’t you try it. Horse
might break a leg.”
‘All right, I ’ll follow the road.
Meet me in cam p .”
O ’Leary vanished. Norwood had
ridden another fifty yards when he
heard angry shouting, several times
repeated. He wasn’t sure, but he
thought he also heard a g irl’s voice.
He rode forward slowly and then, a
bit alarmed by the ensuing silence, i
stirred his hqrse to a canter. He
drew rein, looking upward at Lynn,
not much more than two or three j
minutes after Rundhia had left her. j
She was sitting in full moonlight on
top of the wall, on a cushion, with
one foot hanging over the wall and
her back against the kiosk.
“ H ello!” he remarked. “ Did R u ndhia
leave you all alone here?”
“ He said he’d come back.”
“ Well, he’ll keep that promise.
How well do you know h im ? ”
“ I met h im for the first time this
evening.”
“ Like h im ? ”
“ Shouldn’t I ? ”
“ At your age, there is danger in
exotic likes and dislikes.”
“ I ’m twenty-two.”
“ You don’t look it. I had guessed
you as eighteen. However, no doubt
you know how to take care of yourself
among men of your own race.
I ’m taking it for granted that you’re
a nice girl with a sense of humor
but a bit rebellious against certain
sorts of restraint. All this is new,
and you’re enjoying it. You like the
Indian setting, and the novelty and
the moonlight and all that stuff.”
“ Don’t you?”
“ Yes. And I like you. I would
not like to hear of you m aking a
mess of your life for the sake of a
spot of excitement. You don’t understand
India. You don’t understand
Rundhia.”
A shadow moved. Someone chuckled:
“ Doesn’t she?”
Rundhia loomed on the wall with
a guitar in his hand. He smiled
down at Norwood. The moonlight
shone on his teeth.
“ We were reaching a beautiful understanding,”
said Rundhia. “ Are
you on your way to camp*’ Well, it’s
a grand night for a ride. Sorry
you’re tired and sleepy.”
Norwood eased his horse a little
nearer to the wall. He gave the
reins to the sais. In another moment
he was standing upright on the
saddle, with his head within six
inches of the top of the wall:
“ I am not so sleepy as perhaps I
look,” he answered. “ Give me a
hand up, R u ndhia.”
Lynn watched. This was something
altogether new in her experience.
Rundhia hesitated. Moonlight
betrayed him. Rundhia felt tempted
to refuse. But he hadn’t the iron.
He could have scared the horse and
made Norwood look ridiculous. But
he hadn’t the nerve. Lynn felt sorry
for him. With a shrug he handed
the guitar to her, in order to use
both hands to help Norwood scramble
up the wall.
“ You weren’t invited,” said Rundhia.
Norwood stared. “ No. I noticed it.
Can you strum on that thing?”
Lynn spoke with all the malice she
cot»l put into her voice:
“ You like music, Captain Norwood?
I supposed your line was engineering
and ordering people
about.”

An elephant’s memory is no longer
than its tail. H um m ing birds, so
fragile that they seem winged insects,
are greedier than pigs. Monkeys
prefer popcorn to bananas. The
house cat is more cruel than a beast
of the jungle.
In fact, name any popular belief
about animals and it’s a good tw'o to
one bet that it is wrong.
That’s the conclusion of experts
after actual observation at the Chicago
Zoological park at Brookfield.
Consider the elephant, most m a ligned
of the an im a l kingdom.
He is supposed to live the 969
years of Methuselah, but instead
lives only the three score and ten
of man. The female is said to breed
at the age of 40 or 50; in reality, she
breeds at six and eight years. Her
pregnancy is said to endure seven
years; as a matter of fact, it is 19
months, which is short enough, considering
the size of her offspring.
And the elephant’s m em ory! Legend
says it is enduring, tenacious.
Do an elephant an injury today and
he will repay you in kind 15 years
later. Brookfield officials say this is
applesauce.
“ An elephant’s memory probably
is not as good as that of other anim
als,” Hebert Bean, asistat director
and curator of m am m a ls, declared.
“ I never heard anyone who
worked with them say their memory
amounted to anything. Take Honey
and Tembo, the baby elephants that
Christoph Schulz captured and
brought here
“ When he found Honey, she was a
baby, half starved and wandering
in the jungle. He brought her here,
feeding her by bottle, and she would
follow him everywhere. When he
left, she tried to trumpet, but when
he came back eight months later
she didn’t remember him at all,
Schulz,” he added, “ was very disappointed.”
Elephants, too, are said to be
afraid of mice. The truth is, Mr.
Bean says, that they ignore them,
making the pachyderm house at
Brookfield the hardest in the park
to free of mice. Elephants like cats,
however, and allow them free access
to the stalls. The only anim al most
of them despise, Mr. Bean says, u
man.

There’s something about a piece
of really good pie, with its flaky,
golden-brown crust and a filling
simply oozing flavor and goodness,
that makes it the
crowning glory of
a meal. Ju st a
whiff of the fragrance
of a juicy
apple pie, or the
sight of a quivery
custard in a crust
that crumbles at
the first touch whets the appetite;
and one glance at a slice of dainty
chiffon pie, with its feather-light filling,
is enough to make even a
strong-willed calorie-counter forget
his diet!
Making pies that achieve perfection
isn’t as difficult as it sounds.
Standardized equipment (such as
measuring cups and spoons) and
oven thermometers and heat control
have taken the uncertainty out of
measuring and baking. With a
proven recipe, good ingredients,
standard equipment and some easily
acquired technique, any woman can
make good pie and make it every
time!
Pointers un Making Pastry.
1. Unless you are making hot w ater
pastry, have the ingredients for
making pie crust cold.
2. Cut shortening into the flour,
using a pastry blender or fork; or,
if you’re an experienced cook, and
work quickly, blending in the shortening
with fingers is permissible.
3. Add water sparingly, using only
enough to hold the ingredients together.
Handle dough as little and
as lightly as possible after adding
water.
4. Roll out the dough on a lightly
floured board or on a heavy canvas.
Cover the rolling pin with a child’s
white cotton stocking (with the foot
cut off) and flouring it lightly simplifies
handling the dough.
5. Place the dough loosely in the
pan to help prevent shrinking.

TRADE MARKS AND DOLLAR MARKS
W ITHOUT giving the matter
much thoui>i t you m ight define
a trade m ark on a package or
an advertisement as a m ark of identification
which protect* the interest
of the seller against imitators; a
selfish symbol, you know, which exists
to help some  ne m an or firm
to get rich.
Actually a trade mark is as much
to your interest as t is to the m a n ’s
who owns it and h. s
It registered in h s
name.
For it is a buyir K
guide for you whic h
you can absolute')’
trust. You can buy
anything under a
trade m ark ai i
know that the qu.^-
ity, the quantity and
the price will be
right. You do rot
even have to exan -
ine the package be
fore you buy. If the trade mark
is there, so also w:ll the quality be
there.
The merchant knows that. He prefers
to sell trade- narked, that is,
advertised, goods because they
have the conflden e of the public
and can be sold e:i-:!y. quickly and
in quantity.
Back of the trade mark is advertising.
It stands for the trade mark,
for the trade m ark tself is merely a
design etched on paper, until advertising
gives it fe in the minds
Charles Ruth
of consumers like yourself.
The trade m ark which saves you
money and time need not be a form
a l design of a national m anufacturer
or advertiser. It may be
merely the fam ilia r name of your
grocer or haberdasher, appearing at
the foot of his advertisements in the
newspaper.
Wherever you see those fam iliar
words or names or m arks you know
that you are in the presence of a
m an who is doing his level best to
be worthy of your trade and who
wants to keep you coming back.
He is advertising for that purpose,
notifying you that he is in business
to stay and that you can buy from
him .nnd he will stand back of his
goods. For you the trade m ark, like
the dollar m ark which we all respect,
stands for full value wherever
it happens to be found.
But unidentified goods are as uncertain
as counterfeit money, and
the wise m an or woman avoids both.
And how close these trade marks
are to our lives and how comforting
they are to us when we buy! You
go into a store. On the shelves are
fam iliar marks you have seen all
your life.
, You recognize them as you do
fam iliar faces in a strange crowd—
and they give you the same comforting
feeling of fam iliarity and respect.
Trade m arks exist to help you
buy more serenely and profitably.

DOOR OPENING BECOMES
BOOKCASE
DOSSIBLY you have an old-fashioned
* wide door between two rooms that
you would like to close off. yet not
jrJve the appearance of a makeshift
Well, here Is one way to do that
Made a modern bookcase out of the
opening!
Begin hy designing a set of book
shelves that will fit in between the
Jambs of the door to be closed up anil
similar to the ones suggested In tho
sketch above. You may lay tho shelves
out to suit your own desires, but I
recommend that the bottom part be s
cupboard section with flush paneled
doors. These cupboards make an ideal
storage space for magazines, games,
etc., that one wishes handy to the living
room, yet out of sight.
Fit the shelves Into the opening and
Icvep the edges flush with the trim oo
the room side in which the shelves
are to open. Allow the "odges of the
shelves on the closed side to set back
from the trim about H to % Inch."
Now over the barks of these shelves,
and fitting tightly into the door opening
between the casings, place wallboard
or thin celling lumber, nailing
same to the back edges of the book
shelves. Then you can finish around
tho edges with s small molding to
make a neat Job.
In the design shown above inlrrore
have bi*en placed against the wall
board and above the top shelf. This
will make a most attractive and decorative
effect, but wall paper or a plain
painted background will answer.
Paint or stain the shelves and the
backs to harmonise with the walls and
trim of your room.
If you wish, you may paint tha
edges of the shelves a contrasting
color, which will look well.

Nearly $70,000,000 worth of turkeys
(at farm prices) were produced
last year, reports the bureau
of agricultural economics. This figure
was somewhat less than for
1937, but was larger than in any
other year in the current decade,
and probably the second largest
in the history of the industry.
Since 1929 the production of turkeys
has increased more than 56
per cent—from less than 17,000,000
birds in that year to more than 26,-
000,000 in 1938. Peak of production
during the decade was nearly 28,-
000,000 turkeys in 1936. Highest
prices during the 10-year period
were in 1929, lowest in 1933. The
1938 average—$2 66 per bird—was
about 16 per cent lower than in 1929.
Principal turkey-producing states
in 1938 were Texas (3.285,000 birds),
California (2,625,000), Minnesota, (2,-
145.000), Oklahoma (1,418,000), Iowa
(1,386,000), North Dakota (1.265,000),
and Oregon (1,265.000). About 40
per cent of the 1938 crop was raised
in the 12 North Central states as
contrasted with only 30 per cent
in 1929.
Expansion of the turkey industry
during the last 10 years is attributed
chiefly to improvements in production
and management methods
which have lessened the mortality
of poults and lowered production
costs in competition v*ith chickens
and other meats. Production of turkeys
in small farm flocks has decreased
in most areas, but this has
been more than offset by increased
numbers of large flocks which are
kept separate from other poultry
and handled under improved methods
of sanitation, feeding, and m a rketing.

“ T/ie Beast in the Glass Room”
He l l o , e v e r y b o d y :
Nina C Marbourg of New York city tells today's yarn
and it’s a pip of a story, too. You know, Nina says she went to
see that picture, “ King Kong,” that was playing in the movie
houses a few years ago, and terrifying as it was, Nina took it
without a single shudder. It didn’t make much of an impression
on her because—well—Nina claims she had a tussle with a real
King Kong—in the flesh—back in the summer of 1908. And after
that, no mere picture of the brute was going to scare her.
I ’ll have to admit, and so will Nina, that King Kong grew
quite a bit in the years between 1908 and the showing of that
picture. The King Kong in the movies was a great, ape like
creature about a quarter of a mile tall—big enough to hold
an ordinary human in the palm of his hand. Nothing like
that ever existed in real life, as far as I know, and I ’ve seen
all the big ones, from Jess Willard to Primo Camera and
Man Mountain Dean. Nina’s King Kong came about up to
her chin, she says, but he was just as hairy and just as bestial as the
big brute that hopped out onto the screen from that strip of Hollywood
celluloid. And Nina was locked up with him in a glass room!
Chimpanzee Scheduled to Pose for Pictures.
It all came about over a matter of some photographs. Nina had ■
job, at that time, that made it necessary for her to take pictures of the
latest thing in chimpanzees. The chimp was in the Bronx zoo, and
Nina m ade arrangements with his keeper to have the anim al pose for her.
When shf got to the zoo the obliging keeper brought the brute
out into a big, glass-enclosed room where the light was ideal for
photography. The an im a l shook hands with Nina, and she says
that's the flrst time she'd ever met a chimpanzee socially. Then
the keeper began putting him through his tricks while Nina took
shots with her camera. She snapped him posing at a table, on a
bicycle, and going through all his various stunts. She got all the
pictures she wanted but one, and then the keeper realized that
he had forgotten to bring the properties needed for that picture—
the chimp's roller skates.
“ Ju s t a m inute," he said. “ I 'll go and get them .” He went out of
the room. clos:ng the door behind him. Nina heard the spring latch
click, but she thought nothing of it at the time. Several seconds passed

THEY KNEW
The school-inspector was inclined
to overdo the num ber of questions
he put to pupils. On this occasion
he had proved even more exasperating
than usual, and the class was
impatiently awaiting his departure.
But the inspector had one more
question to ask.
“ What kind of a rm muscles has
the b lacksm ith?” he demanded.
“ Big ones!” chorused the class.
“ Right. Now, can you tell me
why the blacksm ith’s a rm muscles
are bigger than—er—mine, for exam
p le ? "
Once again the children answered
in chorus:
“ Because he works!’*

The F a rm Security administration
has distributed within the past year
1,000,000 copies of its written lease
form designed to improve rental a rrangements
between farm tenants
and landlords. Both have applied
in large numbers for this “ Flexible
F a rm lease” which is intended
to take the place of oral agreements
that still prevail in many sections
of the country.
The “ rental rates” clause carries
a suggested form for stating exactly
the share of each crop or the cash
payment the tenant is to give the
landlord.
Another m atter of concern to the
| landlord and tenant is the annual
renewal of their contract. Leasing
from year to year is a prevalent
tenure practice. In m any cases this
procedure works to the disadvantage
of both parties. Tenants hesitate to
, initiate crop rotations; landlords
! hesitate to make changes or repairs
in buildings which may not be needed
by succeeding tenants.
To provide for such cases the
“ Flexible F a rm lease” contains an
“ automatic renewal” clause. This
clause in efTect causes the lease to
remain in full force until either party
wishes to terminate his contract.
Termination of the lease is in ac-
1 cordance with a period of notice
fixed in the contract.
S a v e t h e M a n u r e
Approximately 10 tons of manure
are produced annually for each 1,000
pounds of live weight of stock kept
on the farm. This manure contains
plant food elements to make it
worth around $2.50 a ton at commercial
fertilizer prices. Besides it
provides organic matter for the soil,
something essential to crop production.
Of course, this value is dei
pendent upon the manner in which
the manure is conserved and applied.
More than a third of the
i nitrogen and two-third* of the potassium
are in the liquid portion of
the manure. This drains away unless
sufficient bedding is used to absorb
it. Also there is a loss where
the manure is left piled up subject
to the weather.

"H is other hand went to my hair and began to shake my bead from
side to side.”
while the chimp wandered around the room. But suddenly he turned
and began scrutinizing Nina with his beady little eyes—and at that
m oment she realized she was locked in a room with a chimpanzee, and
no telling what the anim al might take a notion to do.
As a matter of fact, the anim al seemed to be taking some sort of
a notion right then. He was advancing toward Nina at a slow, shambling
gait, his little eyes leering straight into hers. " I remembered,"
she says, “ that anim als were supposed to be afraid of you if you looked
them straight in the eye. I looked steadily at this one, but still he
came on.
Chimp Draws Closer Despite Steady Stare.
“ Closer and closer he came, and still I held bis eyes with
mine. The nearer he came the more panicky I grew. All I
could think of to say was a silly, ‘Nice monkey—nice monkey!’
Presently he was within a few feet of me. They say that a
drowning person reviews his whole life in his last few seconds.
All I could think of were the horrors of Poe's tale, ‘The Murders
in the Kue Morgue,' and all the other dreadful stories I had ever
heard of apes at large.
“ The chimpanzee took another step forward, raised one great,
hairy arm , and let his hand drop on my shoulder. His other
hand went to my hair and began to shake my head from side to
side. It was before the days of bobbed hair, and mine was long.
Hairpins fell tinkling on the cement floor, and this seemed to
delight the brute. He bared his teeth in a horrible grin, took a
firmer grip and shook harder.”
More hairpins fell from Nina's hair. The chimpanzee began jumping
up and down in front of her, pulling her head down and shoving it back.
Then, to N ina’s terror, his other hand came up. It caressed her cheek,
then slipped down to her neck and she felt the an im a l's short, powerful
fingers tightening on her throat!
Chimp Hears the Sound of His Keeper’s Footsteps.
Nina held her breath. She felt pretty certain then that the end had
come. "He leered up horribly at me with his glittering little eyes,”
she says, "a n d then gave my head a fearful shake that nearly threw me
off balance. Then, suddenly, he stood perfectly still. His thick lips
began to quiver. He snarled, whined and ground his teeth. And while
I was wondering what was coming next, the door opened. His ears
had been quicker than mine. The keeper had arrived and spoiled his fu n."
But the keeper d idn't see any fun in the situation. He stood in
the doorway, his eyes bulging. “ Don't move,” he whispered.
“ For God's sake, don’t m o ve !” With that, the chimpanzee gave
Nina's head one more fearful shake, screamed frightfully, and
struck Nina In the chest— a blow that sent her reeling against
the wall. Then, like the crack of a whip, the keeper's voice rang
out. lie barked a curt erder, and suddenly tbat beast became
the meek, docile exhibition monkey be had been before the keeper
left the room.
Nina didn’t take any more pictures that day. When the chimp had
been put back in his cage, the keeper came back, drew her to one side,
and began talking nervously. “ 1 should have known better than to
leave you alone with that a n im a l,” he said. “ It's a wonder you weren’t
killed Chimps are queer with strangers, and especially with women.
Look here. I hope you don’t say anything about this. Because if it ever
gets out, I ’ll lose my jo b .”
So Nina kept quiet about it for a long time. Now it doesn't matter,
because the keeper isn't working at the zoo any more, so Nina is passing
the yarn along to us.

Surprise
Two young matrons, accompanied
by their two young ofTspring, boarded
a bus. The two sm all boys sat
apart from their mothers. Shortly
after two young men boarded the
bus.
Frequently one of the matrons
would peep around and smile at the
children. The young men would look
self-conscious and giggle at each
other.
It was not until the young mothers
gathered up their children to
alight that the young men discovered
that they had not been the
object of the fond glances.
Dish Washing
Stubblefield—Wash those dishes

“ My goodness!” exclaimed a
woman at a country club outing, “ I

Her husband was undisturbed. “ I ’ve
seen many a hat this year that
would be improved by being sat on,”
he observed.

Copenhagen has a bicycle for

And since many of the machines
are tandems and young Danish
mothers usually have a baby-carrying
contraption rigged on the handlebars,
the city could easily go

As it is. Copenhagen does practically
take to wheel in a body on
every summer Sunday. The holiday
exodus takes place so rapidly
j that there are roads where 30,000
I bicycles pass a given point in an
hour. Few accidents are reported, i
Traffic troubles are eliminated by
having a system of cycle roads from
which both motor vehicles and
pedestrians are barred.
The Danish mode of road travel
has some advantages over our
method of going places. It is free
from gas fumes, and it is silent;
fam ily parties, squadrons of club
groups, couples side-by-side with
arms around each others’ shoulders
drift along with no sound except
j that of conversation and laughter
and song.

• ALLOW CHILD TO DEvelop
charan'teristics. Heredity
plays strange tricks, and
“like father, like son*9 doesnt
always hold true. Individual
inclinations should he recognized
and honored.
By F R A N C E S D U N L A P H E R O N
TH E mothers of the second grade
pupils were leaving school after
attending a program presented by
their children. Martha Kent and Sylvia
Thomson paired off to walk down
E lm street together.
“ How proud you must be of M a rianne,
S y lvia!” her friend exclaimed.
“ I envy you every time I hear her
sing. She has more musical talent
than any other child in the group. If
only my Donald had her a b ility !”
*4Of course I ’m proud of M arianne,”
Sylvia replied. “ But music
isn’t the only thing in life. Do you
mind, Martha, if I speak to you
about something personal?”
“ Why, of course not, Sylvia.”
“ I t ’s about Donald. Ever since
I ’ve known you, three years now,
you’ve lamented over and over
again the fact that Donald doesn’t
show aptitude in music. Now tell
me honestly why you feel so keenly
about it.”
“ Well, you see. Frank and I just
naturally expected our child would
be musical. Both of our families
have more than average talent. You
j know yourself Frank plays and sings
beautifully and—"
“ Y o u ’re a delightful organist, violinist
and singer—I ’ll save your
modesty,” Sylvia interrupted laughingly.
“ And you dreamed of Donald's
carrying on the tradition,
d id n ’t you?”
“ Yes.” The word spoke frustrated
hopes.
“ Now listen to my story,” Sylvia
continued. “ Do you suppose we
expected our Marianne to be m u sical?
No. Vick and I do well to
carry a tune. But, we thought M arianne
would be a shining intellectual
light, perhaps a linguist or historian
or scientist. Look at Vick’s family
of teachers and literary people. And
if I do say so, my lawyer husband
is pretty sm art—Phi Beta and all
that. And I, well, at least my school
work was my joy, and I was always
disappointed if I was not at the head
of my class.
“ Much to our surprise and disappointment,
however, from the time
she was a baby Marianne showed
an entirely different type of mind
from ours—no logic, no reflection,
no ingenuity. Hoping to bring out
what we could not find, we sent her
to kindergarten. Miss Meloy, the
teacher, studied every child carefully,
and I marvel yet at her insight.
“ One day after several months of
school she was having conferences
with parents. ‘Mrs. Thomson,’ she
said to me, ‘you and Marianne’s father
are trying to mold her instead
of letting her develop in her own
way. You want her to be a deeply
intellectual person. Marianne has
' not that turn of mind. I doubt if
she was born to be a great thinker.
But for a child of her age she has
a talent for music and an appreciation
of rhythm and beauty that are
remarkable. Develop them.’
“ That young kindergarten teacher
opened our eyes, and we’re trying to
follow her advice. Now about your
Donald. I think he has one of the
best minds of all the children I
know. The way he sizes up a situation
and goes logically to a solution
is wonderful. At play, he is the one
who devises games and leads. Don’t
you see? Forget his lack of musical
genius and help him develop his own
p articular gifts. Why the scholarly
Thomsons should have a musical
daughter and the musical Kents a
scholarly son is ju st one of the queer
tricks heredity p lay s !”
Martha Kent was thoughtful. “ To
think I ’ve never looked at it that
way! I wish you’d spoken to me
sooner. But we aren’t the only ones
who’ve erred, ore we? I know a lot
of parents who expect their children
to be like them. 1 suppose it’s our
egotism.”
Little-Known Eagle
The harpy eagle, a native of the
forest fastness of the Brazilian ju n gles,
is a powerful predator and the
most striking member of the eagle
family. Unlike our native species
its wings and tail are short and it
is seldom seen in flight. A five-foot
wingspread is considered the lim it
for this bird. It finds all of its food
in the jungle and prefers monkeys,
sloths and peccaries as a diet. The
Indians capture and cage this bird
keeping it in confinement for the
decorative feathers it produces.
“ You don't consider her a good
musician? She works very h ard .”
“ I ’ll adm it that—all work and no
play.”
Snake Bite Protection
Because a rattler’s bite means
sure death unless the victim is
promptly and properly treated,
m any people who live in sections
where the snakes are numerous
keep special bite kits on hand. These
usually contain a sharp knife to cut
open the wound; a cup-shaped glass
to suck out the venom; a tourniquet
to tie above thp wound and prevent
poison from spreading to other parts
of the body; anti venin serum, permanganate
crystals to heal the cut,
and bandages.

Mistaken for Squirrel, Shot—Grant
Beaty, 15, was shot and killed in a
woodland near Richland Center
when he was mistaken for a squirrel.
The boy’s brother-in-law, Robert
Waldsmith, -fired after glimpsing the
ooy’s hair as he peered through the
trees.
Close Schools As Safeguard—The
Srantsburg s c h o o l b o a r d closed

of the weed are used illegally by
larcotic cigaret smokers.
Fifty Cent Fishing Fee—The assembly
concurred in a senate bill, 48
io 27, levying a 50 cent fishing license
fee on male cane pole users

years, women and farmers fishing on
their own land from any kind of
levy.

Uncle Lige bought a clock, so
tall that it was almost impossible
to get it into the house. The old
m an was extremely proud of it,
and found it very good company.
He would lie awake nights to hear
it tick.
One night the clock got out of
order and began to strike. The
old m an awoke and counted one
hundred and two. He promptly
sat up in bed. and calling to his
wife said: “ Cynthy, get up, get
up. I t ’s later than I ’ve ever known
it to be.”
As late as 1921, twelve hundred
clergymen, representing fifteen
denominations, met in Philadelphia

creation finally selected was somber
in color, sacklike in design
and reached from the neck to the
ground. The ladies were merely
amused.
