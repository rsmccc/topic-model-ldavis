Dairy Industry Asks to Tax Itself for
Dairy Advertising: Promotion
W ith the hope o f raising an annual
$225,000 for advertising products, the
dairy industry o f Wisconsin has come
before the legislature asking fo r a
measure imposing a • one cent per
pound tax on butter fa t produced in
Wisconsin and sold between June 15
and 30 o f each year.
The measure sponsored by the W isconsin
D airy Industries Association,
a voluntary cooperative organization
formed to promote dairy sales, was
heard before the assembly committee
on agriculture. Leaders o f dairy organizations
from throughout the state
registered fo r the bill. There were no
opponents.
A s a tax measure the proposal is
unique in that it is a request by an
industry to tax itself. Estimates are
that it w ill raise more than $200,000,
or about 10 cents per cow annually.
The fund would be spent by the
W D IA , under the supervision and
with administration cooperation of
the state department o f agriculture
and markets in the biggest dairy promotion
drive yet sponsored in W isconsin.
The tax would be withheld from the
price paid the producer by the first
handler, whether it be creamery,
cheese factory, condensery or fluid
distributor.
For several years the legislature
has appropriated $75,000 annually for
the promotion o f dairy products. The
proposed program would triple the
efforts represented in that program
and would also approximately double
the efforts o f the past year when
$100,000 was also appropriated to the
Wisconsin Agricultural Authority for
the promotion o f all Wisconsin a g ricultural
products.
Statewide Support
I t is expected that the advertising
plan o f the Wisconsin D airy Industries
Association will ge t legislative approval.
The proposal o f the industry
to tax itself has supporters from a lmost
every dairy organization in the
state.
C. Y . Long, o f Menomonie, member
o f the state board o f agriculture,
warned legislators that the number of
foreclosures on farms “ ought to teach
the legislature that it is time to wake
up.” He said that prosperity fo r the
farm er is necessary for general prosperity,
and that in this instance the
farm er was willing, to tax himself to
finance an advertising campaign.
Bryce Landt, president of the organization,
explained the plan and
pointed out that the advertising fund
would be spent for promoting cheese,
butter, milk, and other products in
proportion to which those branches
contribute.
Lee I. Yorkson, Waupaca, and
treasurer o f the organization, declared
that a voluntary program had been
started but that while the approval
was unanimous, progress was difficult
because there was always the doubt
that not all would contribute. He told
legislators that there would be no opposition
to the tax.
H arry Jack, chairman o f the state
department o f agriculture and markets
and president o f the Wisconsin
Cooperative Milk Pool heartily endorsed
the proposed program. He
asserted that other industries’ merchandizing
is based on advertising and
promotion and that dairying must
take a cue from those and from such
competitors as the oleomargarine
manufacturers. He maintained that
advertising would increase consumption
and would eliminate the surplus
cheese and butter problem.
Advance Trout Opening?
The working man will have a chance
to go trout fishing Saturday. May 13,
i f the senate and Governor Heil act
with the same speed with which the
assembly acted when it passed, 71 to
12, a bill which advances the trout
fishing opening date from May 15 to
May 13. (L a te r: The measure has
been defeated in the senate, leaving
May 15 as the opening date.— Editor.)
The measure was introduced by A ssemblyman
Mark Catlin, Republican,
who pointed out that persons who
worked Monday would be able to start
the season with everyone else if the
opening date was advanced to Saturday.
M
eanwhile the $1 resident fishing license
bill was engrossed by the senate
a fter amendments had been adopted
which would exempt farmers fishing
on their own lands, minors under IK,
and those who state financial inability
to pay the fee.
Present laws require $1 licenses
only from rod and reel fishermen. The
proposed new law would have every

tion to the Leaguers to be at Wausau

W e sometimes wonder if we presented
the same problems to ou r
parents as the children o f the present
day do to theirs. Naturally, parents
feel that they have something to say
in directing the destinies o f their offspring.
But just as naturally, said
offspring inevitably have their own
ideas as to said destinies, and more
often than not the old and young ideas
clash.
Thus the dominating and successful
Herbert Kalness finds himself tossed
in the domestic blanket, for his lovely
children don’t seem to agree with him
about anything, and to crown his sorrow,
his devoted w ife takes the young
ones’ side o f the argument. To us it
looks as if Herbert hasn’t a chance,
but he seems to think he has until his
w ife and children put one over on him
that leaves him speechless iu his de-1
feat.
This charming, hilarious story in
the form o f a play entitled, “ Big

School at the High School Auditorium

The group’s rendition o f the Lost

performance and were played at the
party given the visitors by the Wausau
Elks. The Wausau Elks chorus
was one o f the best appearing on the
program, says the Shawano Evening
Leader.
The Shawano male chorus began rehearsal
