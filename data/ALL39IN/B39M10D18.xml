Father Peters and Glen Whittet returned
last Wednesday morning from
Chicago where they spent a week
and took in the entire series o f seven
games between the White Sox and
Cubs That in itself was a pretty
nice piece o f luck but along with it
what if you were ardent Sox fans
and always had been and what if the
Cubs at one time had three games 
and then the Sox took three and
then one more We understand Father
Peters had a whole flock o f raspberry
postcards addressed to Cub fans
in this section that he didn t know
until the very last game whether he
would be able to use or not Rest
assured he did though and even
thought o f several more he would
like to have favored with one All
that thrill by good rights would be
enough outing for anyone but more
was added to it The two men were
fortunate enough to get into the Sox
club house spend 45 minutes visiting
with Manager Jimmie Dykes during
the course o f the conversation he autographed
a new base ball sent an
attendant around to the rest o f the
players and had them all autograph
it and then presented it to Father
Peters He also presented him with
an autographed picture o f himself It
was hard to take but Father Peters
bore up under it and if we are not
mistaken regards the two gifts as a
pretty fine souvenir o f a pretty fine
week Mrs Whittet came over from
Detroit Friday and spent the week
end with Mr Whittet in Chicago so
he has a nice memory o f the trip too 
John Knutson who is running his
own saw mill at Arcadia where he
is sawing ties for the Moss Tie Company 
had a couple o f his men have
a close call when a truck they were
driving got out o f control going down
the long winding hill leading to Fountain
City on highway 95 The driver
turned the truck toward a ditch
and both men jumped when the transmission
broke after he tried to throw
it into reverse Knutson had sent the
men to Cochrane to return a boiler
from a steam engine and three more
men to help unload followed in another
car The truck was not worth
salvaging but it was believed that a
more serious accident was narrowly
averted when the truck was turned
off the road since two cars occupied
by women and children were coming
up the hill at the time and might
have been struck 
There was a double birthday party

JUDGE H A AN DERSO N S
LONG USEFUL LIFE ENDED
All walks o f life were represented
in the assemblage o f cit zens at the
funeral services held for Judge H A 
Anderson at his home in this village Friday afternoon October 13 Mr 
Anderson passed quietly from this 
life Monday October 9 follow in g 
about two years o f failing health
and a few weeks o f illness the aftermath
o f a cerebral hemorrhage 
He was in his 85th year having
passed his 84th birthday on March
4 1939 
The Rev E B Christopherson of
Pigeon Falls a life long friend of
the deceased conducted the funeral
rites Mrs C B Melby Whitehall 
and Mrs E A Sletteland Pigeon
Falls sang a duet Jesus Lover o f
My Soul and each contributed a
solo Mrs Sletteland Peace Be
With You and Mrs Melby Still 
Still With Thee Miss Alice
Speerstra was the accompanist The
Rev Christopherson paid the deceased
a tribute in stating that his
life had been of benefit not only to
the community in which he lived
but to the state o f Wisconsin 
Because o f Mr Anderson s request
that funeral services be held
in his home and with the same
simplicity as for his wife and daughter
Rose both o f whom passed on
this year seating capacity was not
sufficient for all who attended so an
amplifying system was used for those
who stood on the lawn while the service
was in progress A fter the remains
were viewed by those present
the funeral procession proceeded to
Lincoln cemetery where interment
was made in the family lot Pallbearers
were grandsons John and
George Eckem o f iladison and Chicago
and Hans and Edward Anderson
o f Long Lake and husbands o f grand
daughters W C Fischer and Horace
Ratcliff both of Minneapolis blowers
were carried by granddaughters 
the Misses Margaret Betty Marwood
and Edith Nichols Whitehall Dorothy
Ekern Madison Kathryn and Jeanne
Anderson Rockford 111 and Jane
Anderson Long Lake and Mmes 
Winfield Alexander Madison and
Jack Maxfield Wisconsin Rapids 
Hans A Anderson was born in Sonfjord 
Norway March 4 1855 
There on a little farm on the side o f
a mountain he spent the first years
o f his life and at an early age was
obliged to assist the family in eking
out a living His father lived only a
few years after his birth and shortly
after his mother had married again
they decided to try to accumulate
sufficient funds to come to America 
With their own resources and the help
o f relatives they secured passage and
came to the United States and to Big
Slough Jackson county in the summer
o f 1867 It was a long tiresome
voyage in which their limited
means prevented them from having
the simplest accommodations which
were at hand But they finally reached
Trempealeau traveling from La
Crosse on a steamboat and started
on foot the 50 mile distance from
there to their new home As there
were few Scandinavian people in the
area at that time it was difficult for
them to find their way But after
about two days of travel carrying
their few belongings and one infant
child the family reached friends and 
relatives in the Pigeon valley 
While unlimited natural wealth existed
in the new land the family 
like others who had preceded them 
faced hardships discouraging to the
strongest during the time in which
they were becoming established in the 1
pioneer country Neighbors and rel 
atives were helpful and sometimes 
saved them from dire want Mr An i
derson who was then about 12 years
o f age soon found employment on 1
farms in that community and in this 1
way made his own living and contrib 
uted toward the support o f young
members o f the family At an early
age he acquired the urge to broaden 
his knowledge and to learn the 1
American language so frequently he
would walk miles to borrow a book 
Unable to attend school regularly he j
found it possible to take advantage o f j
the education offered in those days \
only a few months during the winter i
This alone would have been o f little 1
benefit to him had he not developed i
a determination to devote all his 
spare time to study Later he work 
ed on railroad construction work in 
North Dakota and during the depres 1
sion o f 1874 walked through south 
em Wisconsin and Illinois working I
for his board 
In the Big Slough community lived 
the Bendick Fristad family who im 
migrated from Norway in 1872 1
Oline a daughter o f the Fristads be (
came the wife o f Mr Anderson on 1
December 10 1877 The wedding ]
took place on the present Henry Ber i
ge farm in Big Slough The cere 
mony was performed by Hiram T i
Smith a justice o f the peace Besides i
the justice those attending were Mrs i
Smith and the bride s parents Shortly
before Mr Anderson had bought i
the farm from his parents and hp 1
and his wife immediately started t
housekeeping in their new home 
| Mr Anderson had educated himself
 enough by that time to be able to
pass a teacher s examination which
 ie did permitting him to teach school 
Terms o f school in those days were
1
usually limited to the winter months
 so that his salary was small but it
I helped to a small extent to provide
| for his family They resided in Big
Slough until June 1884 when they
moved to Whitehall Mr Anderson
having decided to study law Limited
in means he was obliged to do
all kinds of manual labor to earn a
living He did odd jobs about town 
secured the janitorship at the Baptist
church the school house and the
court house which was then in the
present town hall sawed and split
wood and did other tasks that would
increase his meagre income During
his spare time he read law in the o ffice
o f the late O J Allen Whitehall s
first attorney 
It was while he was carrying out
a contract to paint the river bridge
across the Trempealeau north o f town
that he decided to attempt to raise
funds to attend the University of
Wisconsin which would shorten the
time when he would be able to take
the bar examination and practice the
Mrs Anderson had a family o f four
profession At that time Mr and
children to support But with the
faithful assistance and frugality of
his wife and the financial help o f a
friend he went to Madison in the fall
o f 1887 and in one year completed
the regular two year course in law 
Later he passed the examination and
was admitted to the bar That was
in 1888 
To establish a practice he decided
that the office o f district attorney
offered many advantages and soon after
opening his office in Whitehall 
he became a candidate and was elected 
He defeated the late E Q Nye
an Arcadia attorney The salary of
the district attorney at that time was
only $500 a year with no expense
allowance so Anderson did not choose
to run again confident that he could
increase his earnings in private practice 
While usual fees o f attorneys in
the early years were small by hard
work Mr Anderson gradually increased
his income and from then on
enjoyed the necessities and many of
the luxuries of life o f which he had
been deprived during his childhood in
Norway and his first years in America 
Continuing his law practice in
Whitehall from the late 80 s throughout
a greater part o f the remainder
o f his life he was a resident o f this
county continuously with the exception
of six years spent in Chippewa
county from 1901 to 1907 when he
moved his family there after having
bought a large tract o f land But he
decided that he would rather practice
law than farm so he moved his wife
and children back to Whitehall and
resumed his profession In 1908 he
was elected county judge succeeding
R S Cowie He served in this capacity
for a period o f ten years and
then decided to retire but he did not 
In 1921 he announced his candidacy
for member o f assembly from this
county and was elected He served
a two year term but declined to run
for re election After the expiration
of his term in the legislature he built
a law office on Main street opposite
the court house and resumed his private
practice In 1931 he formed a
partnership with Burr Tarrant of
Durand and continued an active member
o f the law firm until 1935 when
he decided to spend his remaining
time writing local history and traveling 
In the later years o f his life
he enjoyed motoring and although
past his prime he was able to drive
his own car and he and his wife and
many o f their friends frequently took
motor jaunts in the home community
and occasionally trips throughout the
state He his wife and daughter
Rose visited Norway in 1909 and he
and Mrs Anderson made several trips
to various parts o f the U S 
While throughout the greater part
o f his life he was obliged to devote
his energies to supporting an ever
increasing family he always took an 
interest in the affairs of the commun 1
ity and was first in the county in con 
tributing to the writing and preserv \
ation o f local history He was one
o f the founders o f the Trempealeau
County Historical Society and a cur 1
ator o f the State Historical Society ]
In the summer o f 1932 Mr Anderson j
and his bosom friend the late B M ]
Sletteland o f Pigeon Falls erected a
monument on Highway 53 on the
Osseo ridge with the inscription 
 Buena Vista a tribute to nature s
loveliness and a monument to Nicholas
Bourlier the learned pioneer
hermit This monument should be
preserved to inform travelers o f one
who once occupied a hut in pioneer
days in the valley below the eminence
and to attract their attention to the
marvelous scene that extends westward
from that point 
With a desire to preserve pioneer ]
implements and tools and other be 
longings o f a generation now extinct 
Mr Anderson erected the House j
o f Memories in 1930 and the follow 
 m 
| ing year presented it to the Village
of Whitehall It is now owned by
j Trempealeau county and if misfor 
 tune does not befall it will be a
means o f showing the present and fu 
 ture generations many o f the things
i with which pioneer citizens worked 
 His writings especially o f the Pigeon
valley and of individuals who took
| part in the early development o f that
community would make a history 
1 Some day they may be preserved in
I book form 
It is fitting to close this sketch o f
i Mr Anderson s life with a poem
 which he wrote during the Christmas
i season o f 1886 and which was read
1 at his funeral by the Rev Christoph 
I erson 
Christmas Poem
I Ten thousand times ten thousand
songs 
Angels have winged to heaven 
But millions still to Him belong 
Who hath our sins forgiven 
 Then praise Him all both great and
small 
With voices loud and happy 
 Nor let your doubts your praise enthrall 
And keep the angels waiting 
His Father s house he did forsake 
And came on earth to suffer 
 Angels wept when they saw Him take
Man s load o f guilt and sorrow 
 While He walked mid suff ring here 
f To seek the lost and straying 
j And in an hour o f gloom and fear 
i I He died for sinners praying 
 Such love did move the depths below 
 | And veiled the sun above us 
s And should our praises cease to flow 
t To one who thus did love us 
s I First cease eternity to be 
r j And the spirit that doth move us 
f j Ere we forget how on Calvary 
i j He proved how He did love us 
 Now fain would we our tongues em

SOCIAL SECURITY CHANGES
In amending the Social Security
Act the last session o f Congress did
not alter the basic foundation o f Social
Security on which we have been
building during the past four years 
What the changes are intended to do
is to broaden the scope o f the act
and increase its effectiveness in the
light o f experience already gained 
Under the Federal Old Age and
Survivors Insurance Provisions benefits
are liberalized protection is extended
to a greater number o f workers
and to their families Congress
recognized that security for a worker
must include security for his family 
Therefore in addition to monthly
benefits for the wage earner supplementary
benefits to take care of his
wife and young children are provided 
Also a system o f survivors benefits
for aged widows widows with minor
children and for dependent parents 
has been included in the program 
Benefits are going to be payable
January 1 1940 two years earlier
than originally scheduled A good
many people are going to be able to
retire and get benefits next year who
could never have qualified under the
old program 
In addition the stop date for
employment after age 65 has been
removed and that will permit a lot of
older workers to qualify because o f
the wages they earn after age 65 A
new benefit formula or plan has been
adopted which will increase the older
worker s benefits and supplementary
benefits are also provided for his
family These benefits are figured
as follows Take 40 o f the first
$50 o f a worker s average monthly
pay and add to it 10 o f the next
$200 average wages In addition for
each year in covered employment that
the worker earned at least $200 he
gets one percent extra on his monthly
benefit 
Let s take Bill Jones who gets $100
a month on a job covered by the oldage
and survivors insurance program 
Suppose Bill works from January 1 
1937 until the end o f 1939 At that
time he reaches age 65 and decides to
retire and collect his monthly benefit
o f $25 75 and here s how we figure
it we give Bill 40 percent o f the
first $50 o f his average monthly
wages or $20 and we add to that
10 percent o f the remaining $50 or
$5 That s $25 Now Bill got $200
or more in each o f the three years 
1937 1938 and 1939 therefore he
gets 3 percent additional on $25 or
75 cents That gives him $25 75 a
month for the rest o f his life 
The new program covers the wife
and children also as we said How
much would Bill Jones wife g e t 
Mrs Jones if she is over 65 would
get one half o f $25 75 or $12 87 Together
the old couple would have
$38 62 a month for the rest o f their
lives 
Many workers who were past tne
age o f 65 when the program was
started in 1937 were not included 
but the new provision permits them
to come into the program the same
as any other worker regardless o f his
 ige A representative from the Social
Security Board office will be present
at the Black River Falls Post Office
building from 1 30 to 4 30 o clock
Friday afternoon October 20 to confer
with any employer or employee
who desires information

Chicago wants the Convention back
a rain as soon as possible So says
Mr Oscar G Mayer president o f
the Chicago Association o f Commerce 
He added Chicago has been
amply repaid for its hospitality to
the American Legion The 250 000
visiting veterans and their families
have done much to give new life to
the entire tempo o f our Chicago life 
Business has been materially increased
and we know from what
they have said that thousands o f the
Legionnaires are taking away a new
understanding o f Chicago that will
make them our permanent friends 
There is no doubt that within a reasonable
time Chicago will again be
competing with our other large metropolitan
centers to have the veterans
back in annual convention as its
privileged gues ts 
And the Chicago Tribune in an editorial 
 Chicago bade the American
Legion farewell with regret We
hope it will be back soon for another

THE MERCHANTS WORK
IS DONE
The baseball season o f 1939 is over
insofar as the Black River Falls Merchants
are concerned It was wound
up in a blaze o f glory when the Locals
held a g reat Minneapolis American
Association team to a single unearned
run and a one run Miller victory 
The echoes o f that great battle
are still bounding around the corners
o f Jackson county and adjacent
nooks meanwhile Ernie Teeples 
Randles Art Hauser Hank and the
rest o f the boys have reluctantly
hung their spikes up in the attic all
except Hoard who hung his up in
the barn where he can see em every
milkin time through the long winter
months and reflect on heroic deeds
he performed while spiking the turf
with em on the fair grounds and on
foreign soil The fans now are getting
in a supply o f fuel to keep
things warm for the hot stove winter
league until once more the sound of
the ball club meeting the hosshide
blends its sharp sound with the cheery
thrill o f our early feathered friends 
Oh well it s only six months until
the season opens again 
During the season just closed the
boys have set up some very interesting
records a few o f which considering
the competition are quite remarkable 
For instance the final statistics
show that E Rudolph star pit
cher and the pride o f western Wisconsin 
held the collective enemy to
less than a single earned run per 9 
inning game The actual figure is
 89 The average record for Major
Leagues is between 6 and 7 runs Ernie s
figure was compiled against the
best competition available to a semipro
team including the best in traveling
teams such as the Champion
Ethiopian Clowns Satchell Paige s
All Stars House o f Davids and the
Barnstorming Minneapolis Millers 
Beside the traveling teams the best
in semi pro teams were scheduled 
among which were Reedsburg who 
until late in the season had lost only
to the Merchants and the Madison
Blues Cashton Whitehall Eau
Claire La Crosse and other semi pro
clubs were on the Merchants list of
victims Every game during the season
saw the Merchants with the best
enemy to be had on the opposite side
o f the firing line Despite all this
the Merchants compiled a record o f
19 wins against only 7 losses and a
tie in the 27 games played for the
season Three o f the regulars batted
 300 or more for the locals Art Rudolph
led the gang at bat with a 327
percentage good for 28 runs batted
in Ernie the small guy with the
big arm was also adept at powdering
the pill by getting himself a 320 average
on his stick work Bob Teeples 
the guy with the jackrabbits in his
shoes was the other 300 swatsmith 
clocking the 300 figure smack dab on
the nose Robert also led in two base
hits with 6 
Dale Hauser the ultra stylish Merchant
First sacker was a pleasant surprise
at the dish falling only 6 points
short o f the select 300 figure and
leading the Merchants in triples with

4 H Bull Sale
Last week s issue o f this paper
carried a single page advertisement of
the 4 H club bull sale to be held on
Saturday October 28th On this
page was shown a picture o f each
calf to be sold and a few items concerning
the age of the calf the records
o f the dam and sire s dam One
may readily see by checking those
records that these calves come from
herds having good breeding and high
production records Below each picture
we gave the boy s name and the
sponsor s name All sponsors listed
will pay a pro rated share o f the
advertising expenses 
All calves assigned will have passed
a Bangs test prior to the sale 
Pedigrees are being worked out which
will give production records for other
animals within the family dating back
one or two generations 
A fter considering the bids submitted
by six auctioneers the 4 H club
committee in charge of the sale voted
to ask Red English Arcadia to act
as auctioneer o f the sale 
4 H Club Achievem ent

achievement day will be held in Black
River Falls on Saturday November
11th A later announcemeht will give

Rat Control Campaign
Whether the prices ol grain are
high or low no one likes to provide a
living for rats either one or a hundred 
This year the infestation of
rats on Midwestern farms is at the
highest point in the history according
to the federal 2xperts In many
cases as much as 25 per cent o f the
stored corn in cribs has been destroyed
by rats Poultry losses have been
correspondingly severe With this
condition in mind the farmers in
Jackson county plan a one day antirat
campaign throughout the county 
at which time rats will be destroyed
by poisoned baits and other methods
o f control 
The extermination o f rats is possible
only by active cooperation o f the
people o f a community in waging a
wa ragainst the pests at the same
time A feature of the campaign is
the distribution o f the prepared red
squill bait at cost to those who wish
to use this effective method The cooperaion
o f the federal Bureau o f Biological
Survey has made it possible
for people to secure this preparation 
Distributors are located in every
township from whom the bait can be
obtained on the day of the campaign 
Other methods o f control should be
applied from now until Friday Nov 
3rd A general clean up o f a premise 
whether it be in town or in a
rural locality will have a marked effect
on the rat population Removing
piles o f trash burning rubbish 
piling lumber and boxes a foot or so
above ground to allow cats and dogs
to go beneath it and raking out benneath
the corn crib will make a vast
difference in the number o f rats harboring
on a premise Feed bins and
rooms used for storage o f grain and
feed can frequently be made ratproof 
at little or no expense by using
sheet tin wire cloth and concrete 
Now is the time to apply these
simple measures then on the day of
the rat banquet expose a liberal
meal o f prepared rec bait or if desired 
use a home prepared bait he advises 
Poison bait will be distributed to
some store or other place o f busines
in each township o f Thursday Nov

The Black River Falls Merchants 
baseball team is bringing professional
wrestling to this city as entertainment
for wrestling fans The first
program will take place at the Fox
theatre Friday evening October 27th 
beginning at 8 30 p m 
There are three events on the evening s
program the main one bringing
together Lou Mueller Salt Lake
City and Everett Nelson Montreal 
Canada The other two are Johnnie
Benda Butte Montana vs Silent
 Tarzan Krause Chicago and the
opening match of the evening brings
together Earl Overlien this city and
Ronald Blaken o f North Bend 
Mueller is a wrestler by heredity 
by careful and rigorous training and
is well known here through the exhibition
matches he has put on He
has wrestled in leading cities in the
United States in the Hawaaian Islands 
Canada and Mexico and is
known as a clever and thoroughly
tutored scientific wrestler o f the day 
He was a worthy opponent in Nelson 
who made his wrestling debut as one
o f the Royal Canadian mounted police
as a hobby but became so proficient
that he decided to leave the force
and make wrestling his profession 
Although young he knows a lot about
wrestling and should give Mueller a
tussle 
The semi windup matches Johnnie
Bendand Krause both o f whom have
wrestled professionally for several
years and promise an exciting match 
Benda is an unorthodox wrestler 
 Tarzan (a deaf mute) is very
much in demand by promoters all
over as a clever wrestler 
The opening match o f the evening
brings together Earl Overlien and
Ronald Blaken both Jackson county
boys Earl gained much renown
through his football tactics and amateur
wrestling as intercollegiate
wrestling champion He as acquired
a number o f new holds since his first
encounter with Lou Mueller and is
figured to be just about twice as good
as he used to be and glad o f an opportunity
to prove himself Blaken 
North Bend bone crusher should
give Earl a run for his money because
what he lacks in science he
makes up for in weight but Earl is
used to working with concrete 
The card promises thrills excitement
and action for an entertaining
evening 
W ISCO N SIN S H EALTH
(B y Cornelius A Harper M D 
State Health Officer)
Travelers throughout the state have
grown so accustomed to expecting
certain accommodations from hotels
and other sleeping rooms that they
little realize the great strides taken
in health protection measures in he
last quarter century 
One o f these is the long sheet 
Few people know that the fold
back over the blanket and the complete
sheet coverage o f the mattress
are the results of a law passed by the
Wisconsin legislature in 1913 Prior
to the passage of this law specifying
sleeping room equipment bed coverings
in transient places were only of
the type that the proprietor considered
sufficient 
In many cases the top sheet was
only as long as the blanket and because
only the sheets were changed
between occupants the blanket became
a carrier o f colds and other
communicable diseases The under
sheet too often did not cover the
surface o f the mattress leaving the
occupant the choice o f pulling the
sheet up and having his feet come in
contact with the mattress or pulling
it down and having his face exposed
to the mattress 
The law specifies that the sheet be
at least 96 inches long after being
hemmed and laundered which means
that the cloth should be torn at least
108 inches in order to meet the required
length This long sheet provides
the necessary coverage so that
neither the feet nor the face need
come in contact with anything but
clean material The long sheet 
therefore is not for long people but
for long life

PIONEER FARM LIFE
Long after the Civil War Veteran
Iver Torkelson was in correspondence
with his war time friend E P Sime 
In 1878 Mr Torkelson wrote the following
letter in which he portrays
pioneer farm life in the Beaver Creek
Valley The letter was written in the
Norwegian language and translated
by his son Martin for publication in
the Banner Joumal 
Beaver Creek Wisconsin
November 20 1878
Good Friend E P Sime 
It will be best now that I strike
two flies with one blow and answer
both o f your letters at one time but
first before I begin to tell about this
and that I will tell that now are we 
God be thanked all well Martine is
still not strong to do all the housework 
and therefore must we still
have a hired girl The little one is
well but ill tempered so that he provides
us plenty to do He is ribt yet
baptized but I must back to that
which I should have written you
about a long time ago 
As regards the crop with us the
situation is thus o f wheat I have 97
bushels more this year than last or
5Q3 bushels against 410 last year but
of quality number 3 and at the present
price worth 53c a bushel Last
year on the contrary I got $1 00 a
bushel Of oats I got 650 bushels
o f good quality O f potatoes I harvested
about 50 bushels It was a
lucky thing that the patch was so
large Otherwise I would not have
had enough for my own use because
the reason why the potatoes did not
do better I believe must be that the
bugs were in such number just at
the time when they were making 
Com was a good middling crop On
the whole I must say that I got a
good crop but these poor prices resulted
that I this year feel the hard
times more than ever before 
On the morning o f the 17th of
October you may believe that I became
somewhat excited I came into
the horse stable and found that my
drivers were stolen yes stolen and
that in dead earnest I sent people
in many directions As for myself I
went to Black River Falls from where
I telegraphed to many different
places an d also I had printed a whole
lot of hand bills which I mailed to
the sheriffs in the western counties in
Wisconsin a n d to the eastern counties
of Minnesota and Iowa It was already
dark in the evening when I
left Black River Falls on the home
road and did not arrive at home before
nearly midnight My people were
up and awaiting me They had gained
an idea about who the thieyes
w ere and also the direction which
they had taken I ate a good supper 
since courage began to rise I again
put on my overcoat and said goodnight 
I should now again to Black
River Falls and that before morning 
but I had now to make a five mile
detour in the road in order to talk
with a man who might give me some
advice I set myself on old Charlie s
back and away we went I carried
out my errand with the aforesaid man
an d w a s back in Black River Falls
at five o clock the next morning I
looked up the deputy sheriff who was
willing to dare a trial with me The
supposition was that the thieves had
ta k e n th e road through Black River
Falls and gone over the bridge This
supposition showed itself to be well
grounded since not far from the
depot I found the track after the
horses which I knew only too well 
Now it was my luck that Deputy
Sheriff Harvey Allen was well acquainted
on all the roads through the
woods and besides a very sharp and
courageous fellow We went back to
to w n and told our friends about what
we had discovered and together provided
ourselves with each one s Colt
revolver since it was probable that
we had to do with Jackson county s
worst scoundrels 
Now we bore in a northeasterly
direction through the woods and
swamps but were obliged to follow
the track When we had traveled
about 20 miles in the hereinbefore
described direction the thieves had
taken a turn and bore off toward the
south We naturally had to do the
same but such an unmarked way
have I never traveled before At sun
down we traveled over the West Wisconsin
railroad at Millston 12 miles
east o f Black River Falls Five miles
south therefrom we had to spend the
night since the darkness descended
so that we could not see to follow
the track This night I got myself a
good sleep The next morning which
was Saturday we arose ear y and got
breakfast before it was light As soon
as it became light we began to follow
the track and when we had traveled
about six miles we met a man
who had seen the thieves traveling 
riding by just 24 hours earlier Now
we began to hurry still more but in
this way we came to lose the track
and drove many miles out o f the way 
At two o clock afternoon we came to
Sparta without knowing if we were
on the right road or not but when we
had got mid day s food I went out
into the town in order to ask questions
and was then so lucky as to
meet a Norwegian man from Coon
Prairie who had met the men eight
miles from the city at eight o clock in
the morning riding on horses answering
to the description o f my drivers 
At three o clock we sat in a buggy
with the livery team hitched up the
Mvery horses are very fast you know 
and it was also an especially fast
team that we had got hold of can you
understand Since at sun down we
were 22 miles south from Sparta the
thieves were not now difficult to
trace since almost whomsoever we
questioned had seen them At least 
when we were come as far as hereinbefore
related we learned that we
were within a quarter o f a mile of
them and that they then were dickering
and about to trade these horses
and were decided to spend the night
with the same man that they were
about to deal with We examined our
revolvers and drove away as fast as
a pair o f livery horses can trot when
they do their best We arrived at
the house without being observed tied
our horses and after a consultation
the sheriff ran to the barn and I to
the house Right enough I was the
one who would first have the opportunity
o f greeting these fellows but
instead of shaking hands I held my
revolver at their heads and threatened
to send them into eternity if they
made the slightest resistance The
sheriff came immediately also and
without great ceremony laid the fellows
in irons We were glad and well
satisfied with the capture The next
morning we went back to Sparta
where we arrived at 12 o clock noon 
The sheriff put the thieves in the
county jail since he expected the next
morning to go by train with them to
Black River Falls I drove alone taking
all the horses back Mr Sheriff 
however brought no more than one
o f the thieves with him to Black River
Falls since one o f them the worst
scoundrel whose name is M S 
had together with a pair o f other
jail birds escaped from the jail
through a privy vault Our joy and
satisfaction were therefore somewhat
darkened but I have nevertheless
ground to be glad because I got my
horses back The one o f the drivers 
the brown had suffered some damage
on her back o f riding but is
now well again S went from here
to Minnesota and I hope that he soon
will be taken 
As regards the election it went
peculiarly in this county this year 
We generally elect our representatives
with about 500 votes majority 
but this year a green back democrat
was elected with 23 votes majority 
I was and still am in spite o f the
hard times honest money man that
will say a Republican Our new pastor
is well liked He is a very fine
man My wife asks me to greet you
all and also a friendly and loving
greeting from me with wishes that
these lines may find you all in good
health Live well Your friend

WOMEN AND FIRE PREVENTION
In a contribution to Facts About
Fire a pamphlet issued by the National
Fire Protection Association 
suggesting a program of activities for
Fire Prevention Week October 8 to
14 inclusive Mrs Charles E Edwards 
o f Grand Rapids Michigan 
chairman o f the Home Safety Division
o f the General Federation o f Women s
Clubs points out that there
was a time when fire prevention was
almost exclusively the concern o f our
men folk 
There is marked evidence o f a
change in this respect within the past
year Mrs Edwards says as women 
too are realizing that they are facing
a very serious problem in preventing
the destruction o f their homes by
fire with the consequent loss o f life
and property In this connection 
Mrs Edwards emphasizes the fact
that the members o f the organization
o f which she is the head are planning
to devote a large part o f their
home Safety program to fire prevention 
and further that other groups
o f women are also studying the subject 
This is a sound development Mrs 
Edwards holds as women have the
management o f the home in their
hands When the home is menaced
by fire the security o f the women
and their families are in danger 
which is reason enough she says for
women taking an active and personal
part in the fire prevention movement 
Answering the question What can
women do to protect their homes
from fire Mrs Edwards stresses the
point that as individuals and as members
o f clubs and other organizations 
they can cooperate with the local fire
department an dthe local fire prevention
committee and they can and
should support such valuable and
worthwhile movements as Fire Prevention
Week Women can understand
their local fire problems she
says which is their responsibility as
citizens They can and should give
intelligent support to the fire prevention
movement she asserts 
Asked how in her opinion women
can be impressed with the importance
o f fire prevention Mrs Edwards
pointed out that most women have
little regard for fire loss statistics 
If they can be shown however all
the terrible consequences o f one serious
fire which might happen in
their own homes they will be stirred
to action This for the reason 
she says that pain terror and personal
loss are things all women can
understand and which all wish to
avert 
WISCONSIN S HEALTH
By Cornelius A Harper M D 
State Health Officer)
Frequently certain unenlightened
individuals desiring a refreshing drink
o f water make complaint that there
is no common glass for drinking purposes 
For just an even 30 years the
State Board o f Health has been emphasizing
the necessity o f an individual
drinking cup just as it would emphasize
the importance o f an individual
coffee cup We wager that the
composure o f an individual calling
for a cup o f coffee if he saw that
the coffee cup had been used and
showed evidence o f stains by a previous
user o f the cup would be some
what shaken yet the boiling coffee
put in the cup is a marked safeguard
against contracting a communicable
disease compared to the common glass
used for drinking water purposes 
Just thirty years ago it was observed
that there was a fountain with a
tin cup and chain attached to it Nice
cool water was flowing from the fountain
and many a thirsty citizen
quenched his thirst at this fountain 
One day a patient came to my office
with secondary syphilis The mucous
membrane o f his mouth and throat
was filled with syphilitis ulcers This
man was given alleviating treatment 
It being in the month o f June he went
to the Park and sat on a bench near
the fountain Every few minutes he
would go to the fountain and take a
drink On the same afternoon a great
number o f people were found quenching
their thirst from this same tin
cup I escaped apprehension on two
occasions back in these good old
days 
After office hours I sauntered into
the park keeping watch on the guarding
officers and then jerking the cup
from the fountain broke the chain
and trampled the cup The next day 
a new tin cup with repaired chain was
attached to the fountain A second
time I escaped arrest by similar destruction
o f chained property But
the guardian of the grounds persisted
in securing additional tin cups 
At the next meeting o f the Board
o f Health the common drinking cup
in public places was banned How
many people may have acquired syphilis
from this cup cannot be determined 
The modern method o f blood
testing is a fact finding agency and
it would be interesting indeed to get
the criminal history o f the good old
chained to the fountain tin cup in the
Capitol Park In those days undoubtedly
very many innocent people were
infected with syphilis Syphilis is only
one o f the many diseases for which
a common drinking glass may be responsible 
There was no romance connected
with that tin cup

WATCH OUT FOR FATIGUE
Madison Wis Long continued
fatigue should not be ignored warns
the State Medical Society in its
health bulletin 
 Fatigue is inevitable It is the
warning o f nature that the time has
arrived when the physical organism
requires some measure o f respite in
order to be able to resume activity
without impairment o f efficiency Fatigue
may be purely physical or it
may affect and involve the cerebral
centers whiqh are the higher processes
o f mental activity It may be
acute or chronic and if it falls into
the former o f these two types one
may expect complete recovery after
rest 
 Too often fatigue which is long
continue and somewhat chronic is
ignored by the average person and
when not given due attention it frequently
results in severe and prolonged
complications which may disturb
one s entire life and personality Fatigue
may be either the cause or the
effect o f certain disease conditions 
but it is as the cause that the most
important relationships exist in regard
to the psychologic changes which
can result from chronic fatigue 
 Lack o f variation in one s work
may cause an undue amount o f fatigue
in a person performing a simple
task It is the unbroken routine of
performing the same tasks without interruption
which causes the diminution
o f efficiency rather than o f the
total amount o f energy used The
value o f short recesses has been observed
in many businesses and provision
has been made for mid morning
and mid afternoon rest intervals with
a consequent increase in efficiency
following them 
 Headache and eyestrain are common
among the symptoms producing
fatigue The inability to concentrate
increasing irritability and moodiness
are also notable The tendency to
worry a great deal over trivial matters
or to exhibit due emotion toward
simple situations is characteristic
o f the onset o f nervous fatigue 
 Fatigue may produce neurotic
symptoms in an otherwise normal
person It may also cause aggravation
o f neurotic traits that are not
manifest when the patient is rested 
Thus a normal person may stammer
and exhibit other nervous symptoms
when he is tired or he may experience
morbid fears and preoccupations 
 Perhaps one o f the most costly
effects o f emotional outbursts is the
resulting fatigue Hard physical
work sometimes provides an excellent
outlet for repressed emotion 
 To prevent the onset o f conditions
o f fatigue a few simple rules should
be follow ed for example 
1 Establish a limit o f activity compatible
with your age physical and
mental endowment and work at this
level to the best o f your best ability 
2 During sleep and rest conditions
which will best permit complete
relaxation should be assured The
importance o f good ventilation is
great and a comfortable bed preferably
a single one is extremely important 
3 Regular exercise even o f mild
character is recommended to every
one Exercise seems to favor the
storage o f blood sugar 
4 The importance o f an appropriate
allotment of time for rest work
and play cannot be stressed too
strongly

THE COOKIE JAR
Marcella Gill Relyea
The frost is on the pumpkin once
again and the busy housewife sighs
with relief as she carries the last jars
o f canned goods down the basement
and packs away her kettles and canning
supplies for a few months of
well earned rest What a tiresome
job it has been to pick and prepare
and can those endless quarts of
fruits and vegetables Yet what a
lift to the spirit when she counts the
shining rows o f jars and in her mind s
eye transforms them into nourishing
and delicious meals for the long
winter months to come To me this
is the finest and most important o f
all the household arts for each jar
is a labor o f love in which the wife
and mother has put her energy and
skill that her family may be better
nourished during the months when
there are no fresh vegetables and
fruits available The jars o f whole
tomatoes and roast pork and mixed
vegetables on display at the County 
Fair this year were as pleasing to the
eye as the lovely bedspreads and
just think how much better they will
taste 
Kathryn Herried o f Blair requested
a recipe for Chili Sauce but unfortunately
Jack Frost arrived to nip
the tomatoes before we printed her
request However here is one which
calls for canned tomatoes so perhaps
she will find it suitable 
Chili Sauce
30 ripe tomatoes or 1 gallon canned
10 medium onions
1 2 tart apples
5 peppers red and green
5 tbsp salt
3 cups sugar
1 quart vinegar
1 tsp cloves
1 Vi tsp cinnamon
tsp red pepper
Chop tomatoes grind onions apples
and peppers Place spices in muslin
bag Add all ingredients and cook
until thick about two hours Stir
often to prevent burning 
Here is a very good meat sauce
which can be made in quantities and
stored in the refrigerator for use any
time 
Meat Sauce
2 tbsp butter
1 green pepper chopped
2 tbsp flour
2 tsp chili powder
1 onion chopped
1 clove garlic minced
Vi tsp salt
 cup meat stock
1 cup tomatoes
Cook onion pepper and garlic slowly
in butter until soft stirring often 
Add flour salt and chili powder stir
until smooth Then add stock and
tomatoes and cook until thick and
smooth 
Here is a good dish for a cold day
 and there are plenty o f those
ahead 
Beef a la Mode
No 2 can o f chili con carne
2 cups tomatoes
 cup diced potatoes
Vi cup diced celery
1 quart water
Vi cup diced carrots
Vi cup diced turnips
1 onion chopped
2 tsp salt
Using a deep pot cook the vegetables
in boiling salted water about
10 minutes Then add the tomatoes
and chili con carne Cook until the
vegetables are tender but not overdone 
or the dish will lose its attractiveness
in serving
I d like to write an ode to a couple
o f wash cloths They were given to
me the other day and they are so
bright and cheery that they are the
most popular on the shelf They are
striped in every bright color under
the sun and somehow their gayety
adds pleasure to the routine o f face
washing Whoever thought o f such
a simple and effective use o f bright
colors deserves a vote o f thanks 
The farrrier and his family had
gone to bed About midnight there

do you want 
 I want to stay here tonight answered
the suspicious looking intruder 
 All right said the farmer stay
there And he shut the window

MILLERS MERCHANTS BATTLE
Some people have the notion Jim 
That fame will be a fleeter
Unless the story has been told
In rythm rhyme and meter 
So I take up my pencil Jim 
I ll try and tell the story 
How sturdy lads won baseball fame
The town renown and glory 
It will not be so easy Jim 
For this I swear By Harry 
Both I and Noah Webster lack
The Snooze vocabulary 
The sun shone bright and clear that
day 
The sky was blue as blazes 
Two thousand tongues were clacking
loud
With Ernie Rudolph praises 
He had the arm o f super man 
His fingers they held magic 
What he could do with horsehide pill
Was nothing short o f magic 
So when the ump called out Play
ball 
Each Ernie lad was ready 
The Earnie eye was clear and bright 
The Ernie arm was steady 
Then when he faced the batter up
A hard and husky Miller 
The happy fans went wild with joy 
The game would be a thriller 
When all the eggs were being laid 
Until they numbered seven 
Two thousand fans went up and up
Right into baseball heaven 
When Merchants filled up every base 
How every nerve did tingle 
Two thousand fans prayed out aloud
For just one safety bingle 
The Millers only made one run 
Although it won the battle 
Two thousand fans will always tell
And sing and shout and prattle 
How Ernie s lads won six safe hits
From off the Miller hurler 
They gathered in but only five 
From little Ernie Twirler 
The fans went wild they knew for
sure 
And don t you doubt it Sister 
That Ernie s lads played big league
ball
Behind a big league twister 
A thousand fans will tell you Jim 
You had the smoothest lumber 
Had Lady Luck played on your side
You d got the Millers number 
A thousand fans will tell you Jim 
That others are mistaken 
That Ernie s lads were just too weak
To wangle home the bacon 
And so I end my story Jim 
Some one may write a sequel 
The Minneapolis Millers came 
And here they met their equal

ED ITO RIAL
It is America s determination to
stay out o f war if humanly possible 
At least it is her determination now 
But that determination was just as
great just as extensive just as grim
during and before the last war o f the
world We then weren t going to be
pulled into a scrap either But we
were beguiled into it The unsuspecting
 clean cut adventurous funloving
American youth were lured
into it to save the world for democracy 
 
My but those posters were pretty 
And the promises were attractive 
 See the world obtain glory achieve
greatness The doughboys saw death
and destruction obtained horror and
heaped a great burden o f responsibility
upon those who returned No 
the sinking o f the Lusitania didn t
cause us to go to war It was a mere
spark that happened to catch and
blaze All o f the lying misleading 
misrepresented propaganda had just
caused a bruised spot the sinking
irked that bruised spot and incensed
our minds and gave us the finishing
touch to boil our rage to the point
o f vengeance 
Factors helping to put United
States into that scrap were propaganda 
war loving people ignorance of
conditions abroad one sidedness of
popularity o f the belligerents already
invested United States dollars and
the sinking and destruction o f neutral
property 
So you say the United States won t
go to war again Perhaps not but
if we do propaganda will be an important
factor The Americans are a
gullible people You say I won t
fight in any wars overseas but the
Lord help anyone who comes here in
aggressiveness A noble thought A
virture in itself but not entirely true 
If overseas conditions came to a point
where the world would be unsafe for
democracy you d go Oh yes it
would be mostly propaganda but
prominent people would voice the
opinions (theirs incidentally and
probably not ours) then soon where
would we be Over there If conditions
return to what they were before 
 we d be trailing into the midst
o f things Viva la France God save
the King God save Us 
CLASS NEW S
Seniors 
Mr Osbourne returned to our Geography
class Monday after being

We are still shopping around

upon anything as yet 
Sophom ores 
A fter a vacation o f a few days we
came back to school again only to
be received by six weeks tests Maybe
we should get on the good side of
the teachers with an apple What
say 
Eighth Grade 
We have been enjoying a short vacation
while the teachers were at the
convention Was it much needed or
much wanted 
The only happenings in class this
week are reviewing for six weeks
tests That in itself is plenty 
Seventh Grade 
We have a 7thgrader that has been
out o f school three weeks It is Pat
Fullington and he probably won t be
back until Christmas 
The 7th and 8th graders have
been listening to the radio every
Monday afternoon at 2 o clock to
 Living History Afterwards we
are tested with a little quiz 
Remember the Junior class play

SPORTS
Today marks our first practice for
basketball consisting o f running fast
stopping jumping pivoting and other
similar antics to toughen the tootsies
o f the boys Last year a few who
did not care for such foll de roll had
a few blisters on the bottoms o f their
feet or the end o f their toes The
blisters developed into callouses
which are about as useful as a hip
pocket on an undershirt 
All boys out for basketball had a
meeting in the coach s room to see
about suits shoes etc This year we
should have a good fast team if not
so very tall or rangy

MERLIN H U LL S LETTE R
Whether or not the test vote on
the Neutrality bill was a real test
remains to be seen It came on the
motion o f Senator Tobey o f New
Hampshire to separate the embargo
provision from others regarding
which there is not much dispute such
as those prohibiting our merchant
vessels entering the war zones and
our people traveling upon the ships
o f belligerent nations But the administration
leaders seem to be in
guch control o f the situation that defeat
o f Senator Tobey s motion was
easily foreseen Even those who oppose
the repeal o f the embargo favor
strengthening the Neutrality law to
the fullest extent and among other
things favor that form o f cash and
carry which will not mean credit 
carry and cancel a policy o f the
World war which still is costing our
people much more than a million dollars
a day 
Even though the Senate debate is
regarded as one o f the greatest national
events in decades there has
been much more tolerance shown by
rival senators than by some o f the
eastern newspapers some o f which
look upon the question as purely commercial
and want the depression driven
away by war prosperity The
president in his message stated that
both sides were equally desirous of
keeping our country out o f war and
differed only as to the best means
o f doing so 
The members o f the House and all
the parties thereof are attempting to
obtain time for debate when the Neutrality
bill comes from the Senate 
Under the rules as the situation
stands only one hour can be given
to debate half an hour on each side 
Considering that the Senate with 96
members has had 10 days o f talk
thus far and may have as much more
if the senators shall desire it there
is no good reason why the House 
with its 432 members should not
have as many hours as the Senate
has days That point is not conceded 
however and its determination will
depend upon six members o f the
Rules committee That committee is
supposed to act upon the orders o f
the request o f the administration If
so in this instance the matter o f debate
in the House will depend upon
the wishes o f the leaders and not
upon the wishes or demands o f the
House membership 
While war talk at home and abroad
absorbs the attention o f Congress and
the country plans being made for
the regular session in January are
not attracting so much attention Included
among them are several proposals
for increased war preparations 
The idea o f expanding both the Army
and the Navy is being advocated
quietly but thoroughly Increasing
the armed forces ready for war at a
moment s notice to 600 000 men is
suggested Adding a billion more
for naval construction is another to
make possible a naval force o f approximately
equal size in both Atlantic
and Pacific oceans Both suggestions
have been put forth from
government press bureaus to test
the sentiment o f the public 
Still another project upon which
sentiment is being tested is that o f
loaning five hundred million dollars
more to South American countries
to expand our markets for industrial
products while Germany France and
Great Britain are so busy with war
that they are losing the trade they
have had with the countries to the
south o f us Loans o f hundreds of
millions o f dollars to promote trade
in foreign countries were very popular
after the World war By such
means the panic o f 1920 which
threatened worse things in 1921 was
confined to the farms and farmers 
South America owes us 1 billions
o f dollars loaned for trade expansion
purposes before 1929 Most o f
it is in default on principal and interest 
Included in the assets o f
hundreds o f banks which became
bankrupt from 1929 to 1933 were
millions o f the South American securities
which were recommended
and sold as sound investments by
the big banks which made the money
deals with our South American
friends The losses in that earlier
period make present day bankers
leary about further loans to defaulting
customers So the industries
which profited in the sell and loan
game before are looking to the government
to boost business with loans
through the Export and Import
Bank a government institution 
Another group which the war apparently
forced in to the background
is the budget balancers Only a few
months ago they were in the very
fore front o f public attention The
deficit for this fiscal year will exceed
three billions o f dollars even if
Congress should refuse the expansion
o f expenditures for war preparations 
Some o f those who saw only bankruptcy
for the government a few
months ago are among those now advocating
still greater government expenditures
for war purposes and
even Congressman Bob Rich the
Pennsylvania watch dog o f the Treasury
fails to propound his daily query
 Where are you going to get the
money 
When Senator Borah said that
there is something phoney about
the war abroad in that the fighting
on the western front was small and
desultory and other indications are
that neither side lets loose terrific
forces which have been prepared to
make the slaughter immense o f a
size which would make history and
add to the glory o f munition makers
and other war mongers The Senator s
suggestion seems to have been widely
taken up on both sides o f the big
sea What is going on behind the
scenes abroad as the chest pounding
politicians boast and threaten will be
known some day but nobody seems
to learn much about it now It would
be a relief to the world if all the
war makers country grabbers and
profiteers could be rounded up and
chained to stakes in the area between
the Maginot and Sigfreid lines there
to remain until the fighting was over
 and it would be over very soon
were that to happen 
MERLIN HULL 
D EATH OF HON H A ANDERSON
The passing o f Judge Hans A Anderson
at Whitehall last week at the
advanced age o f 84 years brings
sorrow to his host o f friends in both
Trempealeau and Jackson counties 
For over 60 years he had been a resident
o f his home county o f Trempealeau 
but from his earliest years in
his adopted land his activities extended
into our own county From the
days o f his young manhood his sterling
character and great ability were
recognized as marking him as a man
among men He made friends by his
true worth and their esteem never
lessened 
Judge Anderson established a large
law practice at Whitehall and frequently
attended the court sessions in
the surrounding counties in a professional
capacity He served his home
county as district attomey and later
and for many years as county judge 
He also represented his county in the
Wisconsin Assembly in 1923 Of
sound judgment and great courage 
he made a fine record in his official
positions 
He was public spirited and gave
unstintingly o f his time to the welfare
o f his community and his county 
He wrote extensively on the
early history o f the Trempealeau valley
and its people and not only enlisted
the interest o f his readers but
compiled a vast fund o f information
for present and future generations 
Years ago he erected the House o f
Memories as a gift to Whitehall a
substantial structure to house the interesting
relics o f the pioneer period
which he gathered from far and wide 
It now has one o f the finest exhibits
o f the kind in the state and the collection
continues to be added to by
others who are inspired by his own
enthusiasm for its making 
He had been ill several months 
and since the passing o f his good wife
his health failed more rapidly He
had continued his general activities
until his last year and even when
stricken he lost none o f his interest
in current events 
He was a grand good man a Christian
o f fortitude and true courage 
His life is closed but he leaves behind
a great influence which was always
for honest and sincere purposes
and which will continue so to be for
generations to come

William Whitney and daughter 
Mrs Grace Larson o f the town of
Knapp were in town Wednesday and
brought with them some boxes o f
everbearing strawberries that made
those who saw them have an it may
be so but taint true look They
were beautiful big berries and some
idea o f their size may be judged by
the fact that three o f them weighed
an ounce and a half Mr Whitney
presented Judge Perry with a box of
the beautiful fruit and Mrs Larson
brought one to the B J office She
also brought two boxes to her sister 
Mrs Ai Jarrett She stated they had
picked 14 quarts on their patch that
morning and that they have been in
constant bearing so far this year in
spite o f the fact that twice they had
frosts producing thick ice at their
place They have seldom brought
any o f their fruit here for the Indians

BLA CK R IV E R S FIRST
KNOW N TRA D E RS
By David A Blencoe
The first mention o f the Black
River is by Father Hennepin who ac
companieed La Salle s party composed
o f Accua and Auguel sent to explore
the Upper Mississippi in 1680
Hennepin says Twenty four leagues
above (the Wisconsin) you come to
the Black River called by the Nadouessious 
or Isanti (Sioux) Chaba
deba or Chabaoudeba it seems in
considerable Twenty years later 
Le Sueur went up the Mississippi and
passed a stream coming from the east
which is navigable at all times and
which the Indians called Red River 
The names o f the othei streams in
the vicinity o f the Black he gives as
Cachee Aux Ailes Raisin Paquilenettes
and the Bon Lecours (Chippew
a) Some historians give Rene
Menard credit for reaching the headwaters
o f the Black but that is quite
uncertain as the account o f same is
somewhat vague If he did then he
saw the river about two decades before
Hennepin 
The man whose picture aD p ea rs
June 28th was one o f the first
traders on Black River He was
then a boy o f 15 and was accompanied
by h is teacher Together they
spent the winter o f 1795 1796 on
Black River The boy s name was Augustin
Grignon and his tutor was
Jacques Portier They were from
Green Bay Augustin was the grandson
o f Charles Langlade who with
his Indians caused the defeat o f
Braddock helped defend Quebec
against the British and later helped
the British in the Revolution in
New York 
Augustin was one o f quite a large
family and nearly all were very well
known a century ago He was born
at Green Bay 
Augustin was noted as one o f the
great fur traders at Green Bay He
was also in company with Portier at
one time and dealt with Astor much
to their sorrow He lived to a very
great age at his home at Kakauna 
He was visited by Lyman Draper 
first secretary o f the State Historical
Society who recorded Grignon s
 Recollections in Volume 3 o f its
publications His picture is found in
Kellogg s British Regime Carrie
Smith s Making o f Wisconsin and
Legler s History o f Wisconsin all
derived from an oil painting belonging
to the Society at Madison 
Portier was born in Quebec and
early came to Green Bay He was
quite a traveler spent several winters
in Minnesota trading in furs 
Grignon does not say where he was
on Black river but as the Indians
naturally seek the falls in a stream 
it is very possible that they spent part
o f their winter here when his grandfather s
adversary George Washington 
was president 
George Walters Art Larson and
Wayne O Brien returned last week
from a two weeks motor trip to the
Black Hills Just another instance o f
how small and how interesting the
world is they went out to see the
Rushmore Memorial They were the
only visitors there at the time and
who should come along but Mr and
Mrs Jno H Mills and Mr and Mrs 
P B Mills o f this city 
Mrs John Gruber and son John arrived
safely in California on Saturday
noon after an interesting and uneventful
trip with no trouble o f any
kind to mar the pleasure o f the journey 
They left here Monday morning
and spent the first night in Des
Moines Their friends will be pleased
to learn o f their arrival and that
they had a fine trip 
Dr and Mrs B Shlimovitz have
made several trips to La Crosse during
the past week as the latter s
father L Nathanson who has been
quite ill for some time has not been
so well He is again showing improvement 
He had recently been to
Rochester again for further treatment
and had been poorly after his return
home 
Mrs P M Chaimson and daughter 
Carol Rose Mrs L N Cohler 
Miss Jane Halverson and Mrs Chaimson s
father D J Bloomenthal of
Chicago who has been a guest at the
Chaimson home drove to Chicago on
Saturday for a visit Mrs Cohler s
father has been quite ill o f late and
she will remain with him for the
present 
Mr and Mrs Theodore Tollack returned
Thursday evening from Star
Lake where they spent a couple o f
weeks at the Tollack cottage They
also enjoyed a drive to Eagle River
while there going during the time
when the autumn colors were at the
height o f their glory 
Mrs Paul Schoesser o f Hixton 
found several violets in full bloom in
their cornfield one day last week 
Since we generally associate the little
blossom with spring she thinks we
should have a Believe it or not 
column under which to list the item 
The members o f the school faculty
enjoyed a picnic at Castle Mound
Park last evening followed by a
treasure hunt Mrs Olson Miss Phillippa
Hurd and Miss Marianna Reuter
were the members o f the committee

COUNTY SAVINGS LOAN
The Jackson County Federal Savings
 Loan Association rounded out
five years o f business October 16th 
On that date 1934 a federal charter
was executed by the Federal Home
Loan Bank Board at Washington D 
C and delivered to the local organizers 
The charter permitted the associations
to make loans on homes
and combination home and business
property within a radius o f 50 miles
o f Black River Falls also to receive
investments o f money from local people 
S
hortly afterward the shareholders
received the benefit o f insurance o f
their shares up to $5 000 per investor
in the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corporation the association
automatically becoming a member o f
the Federal Home Loan Bank system 
Should the supply o f money invested
in the association be too small
to take care o f the loans made large
amounts o f money are made available
through its membership in that system 
All details o f the association s
activities and records are at all times
subject to the close scrutiny o f Federal
Home Loan bank examiners 
One hundred four loans have been
made by the association in Jackson
and Trempealeau counties totaling
more than $147 000 Over $90 000
o f this amount has been loaned for
new construction modernization remodeling
and repair This has been
o f much value to all connected with
the building trades carpenters building
material dealers plumbers electricians 
painters plasterers roofers 
etc All forms o f business activ y
have been benefitted through throwing
this money into trade channels 
On the investing side o f the associations
records show that 84 local people
have invested money in shares 
These people have been receiving
from 3 to 4 annual dividend
on their money since the first six
months o f operation 
A recent survey made by the secretary
shows 155 new homes have
been built and modernized in Black
River Falls and Pleasant View since
October 1934 In the same period
54 homes have been remodeled and
modernized In spite o f this large
growth there appears to be no oversupply
o f homes at this time The
figures are a good indication o f how
much the housing accommodations
have improved in this community in
recent years 
RE G A RD IN G TRO U T PLAN TINGS
In last week s issue o f this paper 
a news item was written pertaining to
the planting o f fish by the Wisconsin
Conservation Department This article
should have read In addition to
the large trout that were planted by
the Wisconsin Conservation Department 
30 000 brook trout were planted
by the Soil Conservation Service 
an agency o f the United States Department
o f Agriculture 
The 30 000 brook trout were received
from the Wisconsin Conservation
Department last May as small
fry and they were immediately placed
in the three trout rearing ponds
which were built by the Soil Conservation
Service on land formerly owned
by the Homstad estate These
trout were fed all summer long by the
Soil Conservation Service and at the
time o f planting whcih was done under
the supervision o f the Wisconsin
Conservation Department on October
6 and 7 they had reached a length o f
four to seven inches They were
planted in the trout streams improved
by the Soil Conservation Service
on the east side o f Black river and
about 10 000 o f them were planted
in trout streams on the west side o f
the river We are hopeful that this
large planting o f legal size fish will
result in the public having a good season
next year in one o f the most
enjoyable recreations in this part o f
the state and the results anticipated
will be realized

SPORTS
The sports as far as baseball is
concerned is buttoned up in this conference 
The teams in the northern
part o f the conference finished with
two teams tied for first place These
teams are Alma Center and Hixton 
Merrillan ended up in the cellar The
southern teams in this conference as
a whole fared better for all three
ended up tied for first place honors
o f that division This leaves the baseball
schedule unfinished but it will
be finished in the spring 
The Alma Center vs Hixton playoff
was a freak game for both sides because
o f errors which were made
mostly by Alma Center Van Gorden
missed two fly balls that if they had
been caught would have saved the
ball game for Alma Center In the
lagt half o f the 7th inning Alma Center
was trailing by five runs with
two men out when they started a last
minute rally which brought in the
five runs to ruin Hixton s victory 
These five runs made eight all The
game was called at the end o f the
inning on account o f darkness 
October 16th the Alma Center basketball
team will start practice Thirty
men are expected to turn out 
Prospects for a very good team are
fair
