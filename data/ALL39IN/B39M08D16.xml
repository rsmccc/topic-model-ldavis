SE VER TO LLACK
Friends o f the fam ily and o f Sever
Tollack will be interested in an
account from a Grafton North Dakota 
paper which was sent to Mrs 
Marie Tollack 
Mr Tollack the only brother o f the
late Martin Tollack o f this city died
Friday July 28 1939 follow ing an
illness o f ten weeks the greater part
o f that time under treatment at a
Grafton hospital Funeral services
were held the follow ing Tuesday and
were largely attended by relatives
and friends Besides the active pallbearers
there were 24 honorary pallbearers 
An editorial had this to say o f him 
 Mr Tollack s w orking days are
over and all o f us who were privileged
to come in personal contact with
him will miss his cheerful philosophy 
his rugged honesty his devotion to
duty and his loyalty to his fam ily 
his governm ent and his church The
recollection o f pleasant associations
cheers us and this state is fortunate
that he chose North Dakota fo r his
home during such a long and useful
life 
 The saga o f a courageous successful
and progressive pioneer closed
when Sever Tollack passed to his
eternal reward 
Following is a sketch o f his life 
Although he did not finally settle
in Walsh county until 1892 Sever
Tollack form erly o f Auburn but a
resident o f Grafton fo r manv years 
came to North Dakota in 1881 and
had many interesting experiences as
a farm er and grain buyer 
He was born in Dane county W isconsin 
near Madison but his parents
moved to Jackson county when he
was a small boy and there he spent
his young boyhood He clerked in
stores worked in the Minnesota harvest
fields and logged in W isconsin
lumber camps until 1881 when he
came to the boom ing little settlement
now Valley City A fter filing on a
tree claim southwest o f Valley City
close to Litchville he worked fo r H 
C Kindred one o f the most colorful
o f the early settlers in North Dakota 
In addition to his interest in horse
racing Mr Kindred liked hunting 
and that fall made up a party o f six
sportsmen from all parts o f the
northwest They took along a crew
o f attendants including young Sever
Tollack as a cook s assistant At Medora
in the bad lands they hunted
deer fo r a week killing eight young
bucks Then the party moved out to
Montana to get in some more big
game hunting Near Glendive they
confined their attention to a herd o f
b u ffalo and at the close o f one day 
62 o f the prairie giants were stretched
out at their feet Mr Tollack
shot two o f these prairie beasts 
It was all in sport how ever fo r
only 1 1 hides were saved and verylittle
meat 
That year and in 1882 he was
busy shipping horses into this new
territory from Wisconsin A fter
seeding was completed in the Valley
City vicinity he moved again this
time com ing back to the Red river
valley where settlement had progressed
much further He bought a soldier
right from D C M oore and
took up a quarter section o f land in
Midland township Pembina county 
That winter he returned to W isconsin
tem porarily and was married in
the spring o f 1883 to Julia Nelson 
at Taylor The newly married couple
then returned to Pembina county
where he continued his farm ing op erations 
In Pembina county he was
assessor and a member o f the school
board 
In 1892 he came to Walsh county 
moving onto a half section south o f
Auburn Farming there he participated
actively in all community a ffairs 
For many years he bought
grain fo r M W Hostetter and in
1909 helped organize the Farmers
elevator serving that concern as president
fo r 15 years He also assisted
in the establishment o f the farmers
potato house and was a board metn~
ber In 1915 he was elected representative
from this district 
He lived and farmed continuously 
on his Auburn home until 1907 when
he began living in Grafton during the
winters He built a home here in
1912 and has lived in Grafton ever
since although he has not given up
his farm ing interests north o f town 
He was secretary o f the Grafton Deaconess
hospital in 1920 
Mrs Tollack died December 1st 
1930 and one son Theodore J T ollack 
o f Tampa Fla died June 23 
this year in Charlestown S C from
a heart attack 
Surviving are one son W G T ollack

Congressman Merlin Hull has announced
that as soon as congress reconvenes
in January he will renew
his battle to have milk made a basic
com m odity and thus qualify milk
products fo r parity payments to the
milk farmers 
The congressman from the ninth
W isconsin district logically says that
if the parity agricultural payment
program is to be continued producers
o f milk have a right to participate
with the farm ers raising cotton 
co m wheat and rice upon which
parity payments are now paid 
Congressman Hull say that on the
basis o f the farm purchasing power
from 1904 to 1909 on which parity
payments are founded the parity allowance
from the governm ent under
present milk prices would be about
nine cents a pound o f butterfat He
does not believe however so large
an allowance would be necessary as
he says parity payments would tend
to stabilize the production o f milk
products and to increase their market
value These increases according to
Hull would lessen materially the
amount o f the governm ent payments 
W hile there may be debate as to
the value o f parity payments on agricultural
products as a national issue 
there can be no denying that milk
farm ers have a right to be placed
upon the same footin g as the producers
o f other farm products now
receiving governm ent bounty 
Henry W allace secretary o f agriculture 
has had a blind eye and a
d ea f ear fo r the dairy farmers 
W allace apparently does not consider
that any governm ent support or aid
should be given milk producers He
always is fu ll o f plans fo r the aid o f
co m and cotton farmers But he
has done nothing in his nearly seven
years in office to aid the milk situation 
Milk farm ers have suffered equally
with those in other agricultural
branches because o f the low prices
their products are bringing and have
brought in the market Congressman
Hull is right in demanding that if
the parity payment policy is to remain 
some o f Uncle Sam s money 
now being distributed in parity payments 
shall go to the farm ers whose
source o f livelihood is the cow

P roject manager Mr Ruston o f the
St Croix County Electric Co op was
in Black River Falls last Saturday
and engaged Delbert Nortman as

project Mr Nortman has had considerable
experience in the easement
work and fo r the past year has been
employed with our Jackson County
Electric Co op The St Croix proje
ct has 250 miles o f extensions to

Delegates o f the various cooperatives

M ore than 2000 people from six
states met at Phillipsburg Kan Aug 
2 to watch Neil S Beaton president
o f the Scottish Cooperative W holesale
Society Glasgow lay the cornerstone
o f the building which will
serve the w orld s first com plete refinery
as an office a laboratory and
a place o f conference W e are met
here today said Pres Howard A 
Cowden who presided to lay the
cornerstone o f a building which will
belong to the people The program
o f which this building is a part was
not conceived to enrich one man or
a handful o f men Rather it was
fashioned by a movement which any
man may join regardless o f race 
color or creed It is being built to
bring service and savings to the people
who need it most the common
people the w orking people o f this
country It is fitting therefore that
whatever cerem onies attend its beginning
should be public cerem onies
because this program is definitely
in the public interest Each o f us 
no matter what his jo b may be is
helping build the world o f tom orrow 
Although I am no prophet I am confident
in my own mind that the
world o f tom orrow w ill be one in
which the cooperative way o f life 
the cooperative way o f doing business 
shall play a leading role I am
hopeful therefore that the stone and
concrete we w ork with today shall be
sym bolic o f this whole undertaking 
I believe it does rest on the solid
rock and I believe time will bear
me out

M anager Ernie Rudolph himself 
grabbed o f f the lion s share o f the
glory in the sixteenth triumph o f the
season fo r the Black River Falls
M erchants by using 14 strikeouts in
letting Cashton down with only two
infield hits and blanking the visitors
without providing them with a real
scoring opportunity Not a single
downstater got around as far as
third and only two reached second 
Meanwhile Rudy was collecting three
luscious blows fo r him self which was
one more than the whole gang opposing
him could get into the box
score It was Ernie s fifth shutout o f
the year The manager s chief accom plice
was a geezer entitled Teeples
who bashed out a pair o f btngles and
eased out a sacrifice hit which precipitated
enough enemy confusion to
permit a run to canter over home
base The prize fielding e ffo rt o f the
proceedings was checked by Kleven
in the fourth The gent ranged far
back into center in the sixth to pull
in a prodigious clout o f f the stock
o f D Himmerman chief swatsman
o f the visiting crew 
Ellison slapped a long double to
center after one had been sunk in
the second frame As things turned
out E Rudolph s slashing hit over
short follow ing Ellison s blow which
sent Len scurrying home was the
knock needed to put the fray on the
credit side o f the ledger Hoard fo llowed
Ernie s hit with a duplicate into
the same terrain and hurler who
had gone to second on the throwin
follow ing his hit clattered over the
plate with the twin tally o f the
frame 
Hits by Ernie and Hauser in the
fourth as well as a basenok by T eeples
in the third were wasted but in
the fifth the third M erchant score
was coined Randles set the run up
by getting ticked on the bosom by
one o f Schell s fast ones W ard went
to second when Kleven beat out a
hit an an attempted sacrifice T eeples
moved the boys along with a
bunt and Randles counted on a passed 
ball 
The final M erchant tally was manufactured
in the sixth and several
more should have counted except fo r
a little confusion on the paths The
 Menacher lined a single into center
and was sacrificed to second by
H oard s swell sacrifice Hauser
caught a pitch on his forearm to fill
the initial bag N eidfeldt sizzled a
hit to right and Rudy carried the
fourth and last run over the dish 
Randles crashed a liner to center
which looked like a hit and the inhabitants
o f the lanes started scampering
fo r home White the opposing
center gardener collected the pill and
fired it to first too late to get Neidfeldt
com ing back in but Bill was
ruled out because he neglected to
touch second on his way back to first
and so the chapter and the scoring
business ended fo r the evening 
Next Sunday evening the postponed
game with the Piney W oods Brown
Cubs will be unreeled before the
folks The game will get under way
at 8 15 Since the postponem ent o f
the Brown Cub game here last Thursday 
the Bears have kicked one o f
the strong county teams all over the
ball diamond at the Pow wow at M errillan
by something like 20 to 0 This
will not happen at the fair grounds
unless it happens that the Bruins are
the gents who act as the football The
game Sunday night will be the seventeenth
victory o f the season fo r B 
R Falls and maybe Rudy s sixth shutout 
Nothing gives our fireballer
more cockeyed satisfaction than to
set a pow erful visiting team on their
ears swinging futilly as he pours the
pill over

The closing days o f Congress were
quite in keeping with similar periods
in the past H ighly im portant legislation
was blocked in the committees
while the leaders put o ver the grist
o f bills which had been marked
 m ust fo r one reason or another 
Probably included were some with
 jokers in them the real meaning
o f which will not appear until later 
In one afternoon over 300 bills were
acted upon all by unanimous consent 
 and with only a few knowing
their nature and purport Such hasty
action has always been the case in
all legislative bodies when closing
time approaches and afford s one argument
at least against long recess
periods 
The im portant legislation postponed
included numerous farm measures 
which remain locked up in committees
until the January session There
should have been at least time to
bring them up fo r decision in this
time when agricultural distress is increasing
and is serving to add to the
general depression All moves to stop
tne fiood o f farm foreclosures were
blocked even though a wait o f five
months fo r action will mean that
thousands more farm ers will lose out
and be driven from their farms in
the meantime The measure to include
dairy products in the general farm
program fo r parity payments is another
which goes over although the
committee in charge was favorable to
more prompt action Under the rules
o f the House committee chairmen
control legislation and aie able to
forestall action no matter how com mittees
may desire to facilitate such
legislation The cost o f production 
bill on which hearings were held
months ago and more than 1 0 0 members
o f the House demanded that the
committee report the bill 
A long with the larger measures upon
important questions o f policy Congress
adjourns with 3 000 o r more
private bills enacted upom Most such
bills are small amount but each represents
an attempt to relieve the distress
o f individuals or groups with
ju st claims which could not be adjusted
by the administrative departments
fo r some technical reasons Probably
the aggregate am ount o f a thousand
such claims would not equal the cost
o f a new base fo r air planes so liberally
provided in the P acific ocean 
There may be some which are not
m eritorious but they are relatively
few Less than 20 per cent o f such
bills are up at each session and some
have been pending fo r years Claimants
are helpless under such a system
and some grow old and pass away
while waiting fo r Congress to hear
and consider their cases Unless some
new system shall be established to
take up such cases governm ental injustice 
no matter how unintentional 
will continue to bring sorrow and disappointment
to thousands o f good citizens
who wait in vain fo r Congress
to deal out justice to them 
In the final hours the House receded
from its action as to the loans fo r
crop stabilization F or a week the
corn and pork producers in particular
w ere on the anxious seat as the
prospects o f low er prices in consequence
o f a bumper corn crop and
larger pork supplies threatened a
record low fo r hog prices The farm
program is not w orking out as
planned and it still fails to bring
the prices which would equal cost
o f production but the loans requested
may help to stop the dem oralization
o f the markets which threatened 
The loans are not a cure all 
but they are small com pared with a
threatened decline o f prices which
w ould have decreased farm incom e
by a h alf billion dollars or more 
In relating the appropriations authorized
at this session the eastern
press dwells heavily upon the
am ounts apportioned to agriculture 
as though they and relief funds were
the basis o f all extravagance One
o f the favorite assertions is that the
 farm ers will receive 1 *4 billions 
W ere that true agriculture would
receive less than 1 0 per cent o f the
total It is not true Included in that
estimate are hundreds o f millions in
t h e departmental appropriations
which the farm ers will not receive 
and in which the farm ers will receive
an indirect benefit less than
that o f city dwellers 
A m ong the many instances which
might be mentioned w ere space sufficient
is the allowances to the W eather
Bureau including a new o ffice
building at a cost o f $3 000 000 or
m ore A nother is the millions fo r the
Forestry Bureau which administers
a general conservation policy quite
remote from farm ing operations 
The highways in the National Parks
which will receive $2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 more 
including the Virginia mountains
highway which will cost as many
m ore millions before being com pleted 
The appropriation fo r federal aid
fo r state and federal trunk highways
exceeds $150 millions and it also
is credited to the farm ers in the
same departmental bill Farmers use
the park highways fa r less than most
other folks and the trunk line highways
contribute more to the profit
and pastime o f the cities than they
do to farm ing operations Still another
allowance o f about $25 000 
0 0 0 is made to the owners o f warehouses
in which the governm ent cotton
is stored and a further sum to
the factors and insurance brokers
who have their fees and premiums
paid from departmental funds 
The Soil Conservation program
does receive less than $500 000 000
and is approxim ately the amount
which the farm ers will receive less
the cost o f administration which
runs into millions The Farm Security
funds are mainly devoted to
loans and the governm ent intends
and expects those loans to be repaid 
The amount o f such loans is
m uch less than the RFC loans to
railways Furthermore the Farm Secu
rity loans are being repaid even
now in larger percentage o f instances
than are the loans to railways 
As a matter o f fact the actual disbursem
ent to the six millions o f
farm ers is less than 7 per cent o f
the total appropriations o f this Congress 
and less than one third those

The city o f Black River Falls has
been rather tardy in the enactment
and publication o f a bicycle ordinance 
but it is com ing Bicycle and
m otor cycle accidents have increased
recently in W isconsin although out
county has so far escaped a serious
bicycle accident The law is that all
bicycle riders must obey the tra ffic
code stop fo r tra ffic signs and use
hand signals All children riding bicycles
should be taught the tra ffia
code to stop fo r all tra ffic signs 
to use hand signals It is a safe bet
that a child so taught w ill grow up
to be a careful auto driver

closes a busy session fo r the
members themselves The o ffic e work

has far exceeded similar activities in
previous sessions Most members
have been obliged to engage extra
workers to keep the pace In other

their names in order to correct their
old age in s t a n c e records Mr Albert
T Sands manager o f the Social Security
B oard s field office in Eau
Claire issued the follow ing announcement
tod ay 
 There are still many who fail to
rem em ber that when an em ployee
changes her name it is necessary fo r
her to give that inform ation to the
Social Security Board so that the new
name may be properly recorded with
the Board s Operations Division at
Baltimore Our office will supply
persons in this area with the form
upon whcih the change should be indicated 
 
W hen an em ployer knows that an
employee has changed her name he
should take the initiative and instruct
the em ployee to fill out and send the
form fo r change in records to the
Social Security Board the manager
stated 
 Changing on e s name does not in
any w ay change the Social Security
account num ber originally issued to
the em ployee Mr Sands said That
num ber is used by the w orker so long
as she remains in employm ent covered
under the Social Security A ct

who reads it w ill agree that it is
rare 
M onday night John Gulla third
trick operator at the Levis station 
happened to be sitting outside and
heard as he thought som ebody walking
heavily along the track He called
without receiving an answer He
walked over toward the track to investigate
and when he turned his
flash light on in the direction o f the
sound saw a horse walking up the
track He failed to frighen it off and
it walked on and across the bridge at
Levis creek The horse not only
crossed Levis creek bridge but the
Black river bridge and continued its
jou rney toward Merrillan It was apparently
struck by what is thought
to be Train 514 going east fo r there
was a deep gash in its hip A fte rward
it must have gone back on the
track to continue its journey Mr 
Gulla called out the section crew between
2 and 3 a m to get the horse
off the track and it was finally corralled
about fou r miles this side o f
Merrillan It had traveled about
seven miles on the track besides
crossing the tw o bridges There is a
tw o fo o t plank walk on the bridge 
otherwise it is ju st open ties

over the hurt his horse received but
unless com plications arise it will come
through all right

J A McCampbell staff representative
o f the Mississippi Valley Lumberman 
a weekly journal in the interests
o f lumber yards and mills 
came here recently to interview our
tw o local retailers W J M cGillivray
and E E Homstad The August 11
issue o f the Lumberman had an interesting 
article as the result o f that
interview which we are republishing 
The article was headed A long the
Line o f Consum er Contact and enlarges
on the men who create the business
that moves building materials
from the mills and factories into
public service and com fort 
A veritable little Switzerland is
located in this section The combination
o f bold blu ffs and hills blanketed
with forest growth with deeply
scored ravines and valleys where
hurrying streams tumble over scattered
boulders form s a setting o f picturesque
charm It was known as a
resting place in early times 
A band o f Huron Indians found
refuge here in the middle 60 s missionary
priests visited roving bands
o f W innebagoes who camped and
fished here M eandering down from
its source in T aylor county the Black
river and its tributaries were fringed
with heavy stands o f pine and hardw
ood trees L ogging and sawmilling
were the chief occupations and in
1820 the Indians destroyed a small
mill built by trader Rolette when he
established a post here Succeeding
years saw the erection o f many small
mills which operated only fo r short
periods as the tim ber holdings o f
their owners were soon exhausted 
Near the center o f the business
district stands a concrete shaft on the
base o f which is recorded the fact
that from 1842 to 1844 a colony o f
M ormons owned a mill from which
they sent rafts o f sawed lumber down
to their new settlement at Nauvoo 
111 
When large mills were built at La
Crosse where the Black river merges
with the Mississippi logging and river
driving was an important industry in
the region fo r a score o f years and
this city made steady progress dating
from the first permanent settlement
in 1839 
The early discovery o f large deposits
o f iron ore near here led to the
erection o f a furnace and rolling mill 
For a time the populacie entertained
high hopes o f developing a second
Pittsburgh here but refining costs
were too heavy to render the venture
profitable and the plant was abandoned 
Industry is represented by a factory
making box shooks from jack
pine and other timber which furnishes
employm ent fo r a large number o f
workmen 
Jackson county was organized in
1853 and Black River Falls then
chosen as the county seat has grown
to have a population o f about 2 0 0 0 
In 1911 heavy floods com ing down
from the broken dam at Hatfield 
destroyed the local dam and a large
section o f the business district was
swept away causing much damage to
property and loss to business interests 
W
ith characteristic energy the
w ork o f salvage soon brought order
out o f chaos and the visitor can note
from the high bridge spanning the
river rows o f substantial business
blocks fronting on the paved streets
which are well lighted at night 
The forests have been replaced by
cleared farms fo r raising grain hay
and fo r dairying purposes On overhanging
hills the residential section
shows well kept lawns and shade
trees surrounding modern homes 
A t this time descendants o f the
original W innebago tribes can be
seen on the streets as they assemble
fo r the annual powwow and festival
in blueberry season

Incorporated in 1886 this company
was engaged in general merchandising
until the year o f 1911 when a fter
the flood they decided to discard
all lines except lumber and building
materials 
Elias A Homstad came to Am erica
in the late 60 s and was connected
with various retail yards until he organized
the company o f which he was
president until his death in 1925 
when his son became the head o f the
organization 
Erwin E Homstad was educated
in the schools o f this city where he
was born later attending the University 
m ajoring in the studies o f
com m erce and engineering He had
pursued his studies at the University
o f Minnesota which were interrupted
by his father s illness and his active
association with the yard began in
1920 
Com plete stocks o f lumber and
materials in use now are disposed in
very neat warehouses conveniently
located near an attractive office The
unruly Black river flooded this portion
o f the city in 1935 and Mr Homstad
has pictures showing some fou r
feet o f water all over the plant and
pointed out where it covered the o ffice
floor to a height o f 1 2 inches
interrupting business temporarily 
In addition to stocks and facilities
fo r building homes com pletely the
m anufacture o f cement blocks has
been carried on fo r 10 years Three
years ago the properties o f a local
coal com pany were purchased and
1939 saw the com plete development
o f com plete departments o f heating 
ventilating plumbing and electric service 
Less than two years ago Mr 
Hostad installed a coal stoker in his
home and sales o f this item have
beeir steadily increasing 
Mr Homstad s private office is finished
in knotty pine and contains an
attractive fireplace with cabinets and
shelves on both sides fo r holding samples
and filing catalogs

The late J J McGillivray founder
o f the company which bears his name 
was born on the G ulf o f St Lawrence 
in Canada and first engaged
in logging after com ing here then
later he entered the contracting and
building business 
An energetic public spirited citizen
he was m ayor fo r six years and later
served as state senator becom ing well
known throughout the state In 1880
he purchased this millwork factory
acquiring with it the flume and water

George Brooks o f La Crosse has
had his bloodhounds here on several
occasions when they were called fo r
by the sh eriff s department Those
who have met them or those who
have escaped the bloodhounds will
be interested in the follow ing article
which appeared recently in the Milwaukee
Journal as an associated
press offering 
To get on the right side o f George
Brooks sit at his spotless soda bar 
give hi ma new com bination fo r a
malted milk and then casually bring
up the subject o f bloodhounds 
George a new and firm friend will
stand behind the bar all day talking
about King Lead and Nereholme his
bloodhounds 
George is possibly the p erfect example 
ot a man whose hoDby is entirely
the opposite o f his regular
work See him in white waistcoat
and apron with a wide gold toothed
g n n on his thin face and he s just
about the mildest sort o f a person 
tiut that restless glint in his eyes
gives him away 
It s delicate business having such
a hobby and keeping a steady job 
but George has worked things out
pretty well with his boss Bill Bonadurer 
The calls from sheriffs and
police come from all over Wisconsin
Minnesota and Iowa and sometimes
he s gone fo r days 
George has no record o f all the
criminal cases he has w orked on because
to him they re not o f great consequence 
Finding murderers fo r a
fee is all right it helps buy bones
fo r the dogs But George rather
would restore pitiful lost children
and take his pay in seeing them returned
to their parents 
The most spectacularly successful
case in which George and his bloodhounds
have figured is one to which
he attaches little significance 
It was the Jens Thompson case o f
two years ago in which Bob Dunn 
La Crosse newspaperman got his
story book scoop Thompson sent to
Minnesota state prison fo r the murder
o f Louis Joe and Anton Lukes 
o f Austin Minn was hunted by the
dogs in southeastern Minnesota 
George was w orking two dogs 
Dunn covering the story had on
leash Ted a big brown dog Ted
kept Dunn busy because Bob lost
his left arm in an accident while in
high school 
Ted led Dunn to thick brush and
then jerked nearly sending Dunn
sprawling Under the brush was
Thompson Although armed he surrendered
to the reporter and marched
back to the main party with Dunn
holding a tiny 22 pistol on him Ted
lending moral support 
That dog was poisoned not long
afterward 
Bloodhounds are much maligned 
George believes probably because
they were cast as subvillains in Uncle
Tom s cabin A ctually they can be
friendly and at times astonishingly
human 
Take Lead fo r instance George
calls Lead the craziest dog he ever
has owned He never knows what
Lead will do next In the manhunt
fo r Ray Olson at Hayward W is last
month Olson broke into a store fo r
food King who was being worked
with Lead was put into the store 
King nosed around and took a trail
to a rear window from which there
was a 10 foot drop K ing waited to
be lifted down and then took up the
trail again 
But not Lead He nosed about the
store fo r a moment then dove head
first through the window taking glass
and all with him 
The Olson hunt rivaled the Thompson
chase as the most important in
which George has worked dogs The
dogs were not actually in at the
kill 
But all during the two week Olson
search they clung to the trail o f the
slayer o f two deputy sheriffs through
rain and mud and rough brush country 
keeping Olson on the run and the
posse on his trail until finally he was
shot down 
King the big red d og George works
on all cases as the trail blazer is 8
years old George bought him as a
puppy fo r $175 Lead next ablest is
5 years old and the least expensive
bloodhound George ever bought He
came from Canada and cost $130 
Nereholme very promising is 3 years
old George bought him in England 
shipping him here at a cost o f $654 
The figures are mentioned because
they form the only idea o f the dogs 
value To George they re quite
priceless H e d as soon sell an arm

The North Beaver Creek Lutheran
church Rev T E Sw eger s charge 
will celebrate its 80th anniversary on
Aug 27th 
A ccording to a history o f Trem pealeau
county the first Norwegian
Lutheran church congregation was
organized in 1858 by the Rev Nils
Brandt In 1859 decision was made
to build a church as the primitive
dwellings were inconvenient fo r religious
services Many o f the dwellings
w ere dug outs in the sidehills 
with earth fo r floors and walls and
poles hay and sod fo r roofing The
congregation paid Ole Olson a swede
in South Beaver Creek who had some
fine timber $4 fo r the privilege o f
cutting the necessary material fo r the
meeting house 
The entire congregation came together 
cut and hauled the logs and
put up a structure 30x24x12 The
fou r large stones wThich form ed the
corners o f the building are still in
their original position but the historical
old structure itself is now
used as part o f a granary on a farm
in North Beaver Creek It was the
first Scandinavian church in western
W isconsin The old log church was
replaced by a more modern frame
building in the early 70s 
The Rev H A Stub officiated at
the organization o f the congregation
Sept 11 1859 In 1889 the congregation
divided on doctrinal
grounds and at the present time
there are two Lutheran churches in
North Beaver Creek scarcely a mile
apart the one served by the Rev K 
M Urberg the other now celebrating
its 80th anniversary having been
served by the Rev T E Sweger for
the past 15 years 
The second church building was
destroyed by fire in 1904 and the
present brick structure was com pleted
in 1905 The congregation now
has more than 500 members Organizations
o f the church include an
Aid Society a Dorcas Society a Luther
League and a Choir 
The first pastor the Rev H A 
Stub resided in Vernon county He
had 85 miles to travel as he had a
number o f congregations in La
Crosse Vernon Craw ford Monroe
and other counties Other pastors
were P L Larson J B Frisch O

W e have been experimenting with
a new type o f berry the past couple
o f years and just a few days ago we
finally got a good taste o f our rather
unpredictable crop The name is Boysenberry 
and it was originated three
or fo u r years ago on the west coast 
It is immense in size grow ing well
over an inch in length and is supposed
to be a rich purple black when fu lly
ripened But I confress that none
has been allowed to reach that stage
o f perfection around here so far We
think it makes delicious pie and even
more delicious jam But it is not so
good just eaten with cream and sugar 
being a little too closely related
to the tart loganberry 
This isn t written as an ad fo r
Boysenberry plants though we do sell
them rather it is a boost fo r the
good grow ing qualities o f Wisconsin
soil and weather The man who edits
the W isconsin Horticulturist flatly
predicted that w e d never see a berry
and w e d best save ourselves a lot
o f w ork but there they are black 
ju icy and flourishing one more p roof
that Wisconsin is fast becom ing a
real fruit producing state 
Put a few grains o f rice in your
salt cellar and you need never worry
about lumps 
When making a large number o f
sandwiches try this method o f saving
on butter Place */2 lb butter
in a bowl and pour over it cup
o f boiling milk A llow to cool
slightly then beat with a wooden
spoon until it is o f a creamy consistency 
When the jam supply gets low try
the follow ing spread Blend 1 cup
honey 1 cup peanut butter and 1
cup evaporated milk or cream Delicious
on hot biscuits 
The next time you go on a picnic 
takealong a supply o f apples and a
pan o f brown sugar and try this 
Impale an apple on the end o f a long
stick Roast over the coals until the
skin will peel off easily Tear off
the peel roll the apple in the brown
sugar and return to the fire Turn
it slowly while the sugar melts into
candy Delish!

Vegetables ju st can t be kept
waiting 
 The homemaker who is thrifty
about vitamins and flavors gathers
the garden vegetables just before using
or keeps them in a cool place if
they must wait observes Mrs May
Reynolds o f the University o f W isconsin
home econom ics department 
 Many o f the common garden vegetables
are naturally good sources o f
vitamins A and C but they lose
much o f this value if they stand for
a considerable length o f time in a
warm place after being gathered 
Oximation which is the action o f
the oxygen in the air on the vegetables 
destroys these vitamins Heat
speeds up oxidation and cold slows
it down so the less the vegetable
stand in warm air the better fo r the
vitamins 
Another way to keep out as much
air as possible is to peel or cut vegetables
just before using them Also 
peas and lima beans can be kept in
their pods until just before cooking 
and cabbage may be shreddde at the
last minute 
 Cold protects not only the vita *
mins but also the sugar in the vegetables 
 explains Mrs Reynolds 
 Freshly gathered sweet com lima
and snap beans and peas contain a
good deal o f sugar However if
these vegetables are left in a wrarm
place after they are picked some o f
the sugar is quickly lost Naturally 
this loss harms the flavor o f the
vegetables

Indications that progress is being
made in the program to utilize the
Tomah Indian school property was indicated
in the passage o f a resolution
in both houses o f the state legislature
recently mem orializing the congress
o f the United States to convey to the
state o f W isconsin the federally ow ned
property at Tomah This Joint
Resolution No 132 A was passed
in the assembly two weeks ago and
in the senate on t nday forenoon o f
last week This resolution has already
been forw arded to congress 
It is understood that anotner resolution
has been introduced in the senate 
asking congress to transfer the
lom ah Indian scnool property to the
state in exchange fo r the Veterans 
 Memorial Hospital at Madison This
measure had not been acted upon
when latest reports w ere had trom
Jladison but it is expected it will
with little opposition in either house 
Senator Am rose Coller is the author
o f this resolution 
It has not been intimated what
use the state m ight make o f the Indian
school property provided it is
acquired but a number o f probable
tenants have been suggested It is
common knowledge that the board o f
control is badly in need o f additional
housing fo r various institutional purposes
and it is likely that good use
could be made o f this property if the
governm ent sees fit to turn it over
to the state In view o f the fact that
the federal governm ent appears to
have no use lo r this property in any
o f its branches and the further fact
that the property is deteriorating
through disuse it would be reasonable
to assume that the transfer could
be arranged without dissention Early
developments are expected in the
matter and it would not be surprising
if the state soon became owner
o f this very fine property 
The effort to find a tenant fo r the
Indian school property has been a
long drawn out affair with interested
workers in Tomah Madison and
Washington doing everything possible
to prom ote the program It is possible
that the solution o f the problem
has been found in the action o f the
state legislature and that the school
property will be reclaimed Tomah

Little Inger seven or eight years

that something had stung her on the

thinking it was anything serious until
later in the evening when her leg began

any obtainable) She passed away

Either comparisons are not so odious
as they are said to be or those
other states didn t hear us the first
time 
Recently the state health department
published statistics o f comparative
health conditions among the
states a study which placed W isconsin
fourth healthiest in the nation 
W e published the report in our
Quarterly Bulletin which goes to the
health departments o f all the states 
and it drew fire from only one o f
them that being a southern state
which took exception to our including
sewage treatment in the dozen factors
on which the study was based 
This factor was included because
o f its bearing upon the control o f
waterborne diseases especially o f typhoid
fever Incidentally Wisconsin
had the lowest typhoid death rate on
the basis o f provisional figures for
1938 while the protesting southern
state had the second highest death
rate from this cause 
W ell if not odious comparisons o f
this sort are bound to be at least a
little ridiculous in spots Climatic
conditions fo r instance which give
the south a hookworm problem and
spare the north The distribution o f
negroes and whites which seems
bound to upset the level o f general
health conditions The chance route
o f certain epidemics striking at some
states and sparing others along no
consistent lines And even the factor
o f population densities 
Just the same though our study
was made with the defendable purpose
o f nudging Wisconsin residents
and telling them that providence has
given us one o f the best natural setups

Flowers bloom on the rock garden s
face
Like smiles they are and well in
place 
To smile the while we work or play
Is the most desirable any way 
But smiles like seeds must planted be
I f they would bloom on you and me 
So plant some smiles and see them
grow
Am ong the wrinkles row on row
And know the jo y o f tranquil mind
That comes to vou from being kind

 L et go swimming is the call that
is heard a great deal during the hot
midsummer days The State Medical
Society in a health bulletin urges that
proper precautions be taken as to
time o f entering the water length o f
swim as guided by physical ability and
tolerance and the care o f the nose
and ears 
 Children in normal health are always
active and can therefore enter
into summer exercise with little preparatory
training Adults however 
who lead a sedentary life all the year
around cannot expect to partake o f
strenuous exercise in the short time
allotted fo r a vacation W e have
heard many times that we should
avoid swimming after meals keep out
o f polluted water and avoid overexertion
at all times but especially
when in deep water But how many
o f us pay any attention to our ears
and noses 
 To be absolutely safe from nasal
and ear infection while in the water 
mouth breathing is the simplest for
the m ajority however inhalation
through the mouth and exhalation
from the nose is permissible fo r the
more expert swimmer Nasal exhalation
must be timed to occur when
contact is made with the water If
plunging or diving is the mode o f entering
the water nasal exhalation at
the moment o f contact is necessary
fo r safety Never jum p into the water
unless the nostrils are both pinched
shut either with the fingers or by
a suitable nose clamp One must always
remember that the nasal passages
and the throat o f perfectly healthy
individuals harbor germs I f the
nasal mucosa is covered with its protective
secretion no invasion o f the
deeper structures will ensue However 
prolonged bathing will wash
away this normal secretion and open
up avenues fo r infection 
 The ear rarely is infected by way
o f the external canal or outer ear 
The middle ear opens through the
Eustachian tube into the back o f the
nose and it is here that the start o f
infection usually ossurs Most o f our
serious summer mastoid infections begin
with a so called swimmer s ear 
a purulent infection o f the middle ear
which if not immediately drained 
will cause infection o f the mastoid
bone Inflammation o f the Eustachian
tube with subsequent closure is
the commonest cause o f hearing impairment 
 Should you be so unfortunate as
to contract an ear or sinus infection
while in swimming go to see your
physician at once He will be able
to tell you how severe the infection
is and how important it is to relieve it
at once if surgical attention is necessary 
 Remember it is o f utmost importance
to breathe correctly during
swimming Mouth breathing is preferred
fo r the novice Only the expert
who can properly time his contact
with the surface o f the water is
permitted to exhale through the nose 
Those who have sinus or ear involvement
that is no longer acute may go
in swimming only if they follow the
precautionary measures o f blocking
the nasal and ear openings Under
no circumstances can water be permitted
to enter the nose or ear Only
then may be eliminate much o f the
unnecessary suffering o f those who indulge
in so healthful a sport as swimm

W ISCONSIN S HEALTH
(B y Cornelius A Harper M D 
State Health O fficer)
W isconsin is now in the second
year o f an augmented program for
the eradication o f venereal diseases 
and the results will soon be reflected
in our vital statistics 
It was back in 1915 that Wisconsin
undertook venereal disease
control That was a period when
people and newspapers alike considered
the subject too horrendous to
mention with the result that ignorance
o f the workings o f syphilis and
gonorrhea made their increase all the
easier 
The story reads differently from
1915 on and today Wisconsin has a
working program against these ailments
that is going to gain the control
over them that certain European
nations now enjoy 
Located at convenient population
centers are 13 clinics at which indigents
who are afflicted with a venereal
disease may secure treatment
without charge 
Five recently appointed nurses
bring to 1 0 the number o f trained
women workers who in addition to
their clinical duties act as case finders
and who see to it that enrolled
patients continue to receive treatment 
Federal funds have made the augmented
program possible One result
is an increase in reported new
cases o f venereal diseases but this
trend just as in tuberculosis will
soon result in few er deaths because
timely treatment can prevent death
from these causes 
So that syphilis called the great
imitator because o f the many forms it
can assume will soon be running out
o f disguises in Wisconsin

 Temper tantrums in babies should
be cured early or they will carry
over into later life is the advice
o f the State M edical Society 
 The crying spells o f infancy unless
controlled quickly develop into
fits o f anger and temper tantrums o f
older infants and children When an
infant is restrained he usually
screams and strikes out with his arms
and legs f o r several months anything
which restrams him is likely to
elicit crying and vigorous movements 
Other emotions such as fear may
produce the same reactions It is not
possible to tell from the reaction
in an infant the type o f emotion
uiat has produced it 
 A s the child grows older the
emotional responses begin to follow
more definite patterns lh e child becomes
angry whenever anything interferes
with his movements o r activities 
He responds to crying 
throwing himself on the floor kicking
and throwing things Thus temper
tantrums start 
 Various authorities suggest the
follow ing methods which will help
parents train the child to control his
emotions and to restrict his behavior
to useful activities in response to
these em otions 
1 Pay no attention to the child
when he has a temper tantrum Put
him into a room where anything
which he may destroy is out o f
reach and leave him alone until the
tantrum is over 
2 Pay more attention to the good
behavior o f the child less to the bad 
3 Make sure that the child does
not attain by the tantrum the object
fo r which he is having it 
4 Control your own temper Tantrums
are often imitative 
5 Do not talk before the child
about his bad temper or naughtiness 
6 Do not scold the child nor punish
him fo r the tantrum i f le ft undisturbed
he will quickly forget his
anger If you notice it the natural
reaction may soon be used as a means
o f tyrannizing you 
7 There are many legitimate reasons
fo r anger Try to keep these
causes restricted to the minimum Interfere
as little as possible with the
child s natural activities Correct improper
behavior promptly with as
little fuss as possible Do not permit
today what will be forbidden tomorrow 
8 Look fo r any physical source o f
irritation such as ill health Remedy
it if any exists Help the child
with his difficulties if he asks fo r
help Otherwise control your annoyance 
and take no notice o f the child s
temporary explosions o f anger He
will rapidly learn that anger and
tantrums do not secure fo r him the
things he desires so will learn to
control his anger and employ himself
with more useful behavior 
 Breath holding is usually an outgrowth
o f prolonged periods o f crying 
During a crying spell the child
may hold his breath long enough perhaps
to lose consciousness momentarily 
This occasions great concern on
the part o f the parent who may rush
to the child throw cold water on
him pick him up or perform other
useless motions 
 The child quickly learns that
breath holding is a means o f securing
attention and o f obtaining other
things he may want Just as with
temper tantrums the cure is to make
sure the child does not get the desired
attention or other object he is seeking
to attain W hen he thus holds
his breath he should be completely
ignored Never has a child injured
himself during such an attack and if
left alone the breathing begins normally
in a few seconds 
 It is best to correct tem per tantrums
early before the child learns
that he may use them to get what he
wants 
S T A T E S U M M E R C A M P S
(B y Cornelius A Harper M D )
Wisconsin has close to 150 o f a
type o f institution which is not a
school but which offers education o f
the highest sort 
W e refer to our summer camps 
operated under various auspices fo r
our young people A visit to one o f
them is a thrilling experience 
No books are in evidence but the
tradition o f Mark Hopkins at one end
o f inviting log and his pupil at
the other is conspicuously present 
The lessons that are taught and
taught so naturally that they are digested
with the greatest o f ease are
how to live simply and close to nature 
thus getting great zest out o f
life and how to get along well in the
community in which you find yourself 
They practice what they preach in
those camps Theoretical speculation
is confined to the pow wows around
the evening cam pfire fo r the daytime 
living is the thing 
A fellow tells the counsellers what
he is interested in along the line o f
hobbies and they give him a chance
to carry that interest along and
broaden it They have a craft room
at most o f these camps and the boys
use it in relays 
The food is simple well chosen fo r
the various needs o f a grow ing young
body The hours are as o f the old
days governed more by the sun than
by the bright lights 
Decent living and good sportmanship
in our workaday grind are not
always in evidence Perhaps we can
learn from these young people Hope
springs eternal

Chapter Three
Late in the fall o f 1839 James
O Neill with a few men and teams 
came onto the river from Prairie du
Chien and located fo r the follow ing
winter in the bottoms o f Robinson
Creek as now known and called and
was there engaged in getting out timber 
S
paulding and W ood s men at the
Falls in the meantime continued
getting out tim ber fo r the mill frame 
and otherwise until about the last
o f February when their supplies ran
out and Robert W ood and all the
men left fo r the lower country leaving
Spauldin galone who was determined
that his claim should not be
abandoned for a moment and who
with his rifle supplied him self with
what meat he wanted and dieted exclusively
upon game until the 2 1 st o f
March About that time the river
having opened the W oods returned
with a party o f eight men including
among them William Pauley who
subsequently acquired considerable local
notoriety as the murderer o f Moses
Clark at Neillsville Clark county 
A fter the arrival o f the W oods
party the mill upon Tow n Creek was
soon erected and in running order 
Shortly after that the W oods concluded
between themselves that Spaulding
was one too many and ejected
him vi at armis and he seeing that
there was a too heavy force against
him to contend successfully against 
wended his way down to Prairie du
Chien where he procured legal process
and returned with the Sheriff 
who placed him again in possession
as join t tenant Craw ford county at
that date embraced about all o f the
Northwestern portion o f the State 
On the opening o f spring o f 40 
James O Neill moved up from Robinson
Creek to the mouth o f P erry s
Creek and commenced at once to get
out a mill frame and during the fo llowing
fall had it raised on the site
o f the present mill at that point it
being about three miles below the
Falls 
The follow ing summer Horatio
Curts and Jonathan N chols arrived
in the country and located at the
mouth o f the creek about 1 2 miles
below the Falls which ever since has
borne the name o f Nichols Creek 
where they at once began to prepare
for and did before winter set in 
erect a saw mill 
The same spring Robert Douglas
came onto the river but not having
saw mill on the brain quite as heavy
as the settlers preceding him located
upon the farm in the present town o f
Melrose where he now lives and
commenced putting in a crop wisely
concluding that the lumbermen could
not live on saw dust alone 
During the year Andrew Sheppard
arrived and commenced lumbering
operations below the Falls In the
fall o f 1840 Spaulding and the
W oods put up a frame o f their second
and larger mill on the present site o f
the saw mill o f D J Spaulding Esq 
and it was got into running order during
the spring o f 1841 By that time
it was discovered that Spaulding and
the W oods could not do business
amicably together and their disagreements
resulted in the W oods selling
out to Spaulding all their interest at
the Falls fo r fou r hundred thousand
feet o f sawed lumber payable in three
installments at Quincy 111 independent
o f an agreement on Spaulding s
part to pay off the firm debts then
am ounting to about $5 000 more 
The W oods then left the country 
and were no more heard o f on the
river except in connection with subsequent
attempts to regain the property
thus transferred to Spaulding 
o f which mention will be made at the
proper time 
In the summer o f 1841 Thomas
Douglas came onto the river and selected
a site fo r a saw mill near the
mouth o f what has since been called
Douglas Creek at North Bend in the
south west corner o f the present town
o f Melrose 
The year closed upon the settlers
mentioned without the occurrence o f
noteworthy incidents The mills in
question were com pleted and running 
Spaulding had commenced clearing
fo r a farm at the Falls near where
now stands the residence o f his son 
D J Spaulding Esq 
The country bordering on Black
River was found to be full o f game 
Elk were found in great abundance
along the whole length o f the Trempealeau
river The creeks were dammed
by beaver at short intervals from
course to mouth and it s no wonder
that the demoralized remnant o f the
VVinnebagoes yet are seen stalking
around in our midst disliking to permanently
leave the country o f their
birth and which was the choicest
hunting ground in the Northwest and
in which they yet find game enough
to answer their wants 
In the fall o f 1S42 Andrew Sheppard
commenced the erection o f a
saw mill at o r near the mouth o f
Squaw Creek and near his present
residence 
The origin o f the name Squaw
Creek is involved in some mystery 
but the general impression o f the
early settlers concerning it (and derived
from the Indians) was that
long before a squaw had been drowned
near the mouth o f the creek while
fishing and that the Indians then
named it Squaw Creek which name
it has since borne 
D uring the year delegations o f
Mormons came up the river from
Nauvoo 111 in order to get material
fo r their Temple and purchased the
h alf interest o f Jonathan Nichols that
he jointly owned with Horatio Curts 
Late that fall Hudson Nichols son
o f Jonathan came up to the Falls
and inform ed Spaulding that the
Sunday before the Mormon Elder
had revealed to his breathren that
that winter they should log off Spaulling s
claim (on the east side o f the
river and below the present site o f
Cam pbell s m ills ) that the wilderness
was the L ord s and that no Gentile

A checkup o f the nation s fatalities
fo r 1938 is convincing p ro o f that
the pedestrian could materially improve
that record by being careful 
Almost 40 per cent o f the autom obile
fatalities last year were pedestrians 
The autom obile driver is not
always to blame The pedestrian
sometimes puts the driver in a very
precarious situation by dum b walking 
In some sections o f the country
special campaigns and safety drives
are being made to educate the pedestrian
on safe conduct on ou r streets

claim would be respected by the
Saints Spaulding at once resolved
that the genuineness o f the revelation
should be thoroughly tested if the
threatened attempt was made He had
not long to wait for within a week 
the Mormon logging crew w ere on
their way up to the claim and Spaulding
having made up his mind to butt
against the revelation and try titles
with the Saints got together about
twenty o f his men well armed with
carnal weapons started after them 
the distance being about eight miles 
Halting his men before he reached
the Mormon camp he went ahead to
see what the prospect was and found
the Saints had been at work like beavers
having fallen about 300 trees 
Finding the Elder Spaulding inquired
o f him whether he was not
aware that he was trespassing on his
claim 
The Elder remarked that it didn t
make any difference whether he was
or n ot that he should cut timber
wherever he could find it that he
had located his camp and intended
to log there that winter at all events 
Spaulding being slightly provoked
at the tone adopted by the follow er
o f Great Joseph intimated that h e d
be d d if he should cut another
tree on the claim and yelling fo r his
men they were on the spot instantly 
completely surprising the crew o f
lumbering Saints N ow says Spaulding
to the Elder I ll give you ten
minutes to get out o f this and if not
off within that time there may be
more Saints in Heaven but I know
there will be few er on earth The
Elder finding himself at Spaulding s
mercy commenced crying and averred
that such treatment was worse
than than o f the Missourians but
within the ten minutes allotted their
teams were geared up their plunder
loaded in and they headed off down
stream groaning in very bitterness
