FORTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN. THURSDAY, OCTOBER 19. 1939 NUMBER 49
No Increased Pensions
Unless there is a special session,
called to consider again old ape pen-1
sions and to provide for means of raising
additional revenue, there is considerable
doubt if there will he any
increased monthly allowances for
Wisconsin old ape pensioners.
When the legislature* adjourned two
weeks nc'o thev sent on to Governor
Heil a bill callimr for an annropri^tion
from th#* general fund of 3H million
dollars for pensions in excess of the |
budgetary allowance as set forth in the
budget bill. The bill also raised the
age limit for pensions for dependent j
children from 16 to 18: decreased the,
rounty’s share of old age pensions
costs from 20 to 15 per cent by increasing
the state’s share from 30 to,
35 per cent: and increased the state’s
share of administrative costs. The,
legislature after several attempts fa iled
to attach a revenue rider to the bill
to take care of the increased costs.
Although under the nronosed bill
maximum pensions would have been |
increased from $30 to $40 monthly,
state pension officials estimated that j
the new law if adopted would raise
monthly allowances by about $‘2.50 for;
the averacre old age recipient.
Governor Heil’s action Saturday inj
vetoiner parts of the bill and signing
others is said to have the effect of killing
the bill.
The Governor’s Veto
Governor Julius P. Heil did not veto
all of the old age ?>ension bill, in fact
be signed that portion of it which provided
for increased maximum monthly
allowances. But he did veto the section
which provided for the appropriation.
He also vetoed the decreased
share of pensions cost bv counties and
the provision to raise the age limit for
dependent children.
Following the Governor’s action on
the bill it was sent over to secretary
of state’s office for enrollment prior
to publication which would make it
law. Secretary of State Fred Zimmerman
refuses to publish the bill. Tt is
his opinion, and he backs it up with a
supreme court decision, that a Governor’s
nartipl veto of a law af*or tho
legislature has adjourned nullifies the
entire bill.
It is probable that the state attornev
ppppral will be asked to make a
ruling: to settle the Heil-Zimmerman
difference of omnion. But in anv
event, even if the increased pension
bill becomes law over Zimmerman’s
obiections to Heil’s partial vote, there
still remains the problem of raising
funds to pav for pension* *rd other
state expenditures. The legislature
adiourned lepvin^ an e^tin^ted b»»d«*et
deficit of more than 18 million dollars.
New A ppointments
Frank C. Klode. 73. nres’^ent of the
state board of control. ha« b^°n named
director of tbe new. important department
of public welfare.
The new «tate administrative division
set up bv the 1939 legislature consolidates
under one division all the
functions of the old board of control
welfare department, pension d e p a r t ment.
board of mental hygiene, child
welfare, and other social service functions.
Five different divisions will be
set up in the department to take care
of its functions. Klode will name the
heads of the five divisions.
Klode. a retired furniture manufacturer
and dealer, is a close friend of
Governor Heil’s. He served on the
board of control during former Governor
Fred R. Zimmerman’s administration
in 1927-28, and wa«* named to the
board by Heil early this year.
Also filled recently is the post of
head of the rural electrification coordination
office which was set up in
the department of agriculture and
markets bv this year’s legislature.
Major Robert A. Merrill, 55, Eau
Claire, named to the position, has been
engineer for the Northern States
Power Company. He has been with
the company for the past 15 vears.
during which he spent much of the
time planning and promoting the
company’s extensions outside urban
communities. He was a major during
the World War, and dufing the past
legislative session was assembly sergeant-
at-arms.. He is a graduate of
the University of Wisconsin, where he
majored in electrical eneineering.
C igare tte Tax Returns
Wisconsin’s 25 day old cigarette tax
has brought in almost one-half million
dollars to the state treasury since collections
began, reports Chief John W.
Roach of the beverage tax division.
Receipts during the past week
totalled about $73,000 to bring the
figure since the tax began to $480,000.
Roach said there were still «ome retailers
who had not yet sent in notar
ized inventories of the stock on hand
September 20, the day the tax went
into effect. Dealers who have not sent
in reports together with the tax due
on the stock on hand are liable to a
penalty of 15 per cent of the delinquent
tax.
Capitol Notes
The attorney general’s office has
been asked to issue an opinion on
whether Thanksgiving day shall be observed
November 23 or November 30.
Governor Heil has repeatedly stated
that he does not want to upset tradition
and go along with President
Roosevelt on a November 23 Thanksgiving.
There is a question of whether
or not the presidential proclamation
takes precedence.
President Dykstra of the University
of Wisconsin has asked members of
the board of regents to join him in
presenting to the emergency board the
case of the low salaried university employee
whose salary would be further
reduced by the proposed 25 per cent
emergency board cut.
Joseph M. Boyd, 77, former Madison
investment banker, has been granted
a full pardon by Governor Heil. Boyd
had served 4*6 years of a 10 to 15
year term for embezzlement and vio- j
lation of the blue sky law. Former!
Governor La Follette had paroled J
Boyd, but had refused to grant him
a full pardon.

Formerly when it became necessarv
for the school board to borrow money,
such loans have been obtained from
the State Trust Funds.
Tn the present instance the Citizens
State Bank of this village has signified
its willingness to furnish sueh monev
and in order to obtain it from the
local bank it becomes necessary to ob
tain such money by way of a bond
issue: the procedure for which is different
than that applicable to obtaining
it from the State Trust Funds
Therefore, in view of the fact that
in the present instance an election
lastine all dav is necessarv. the school
board has decided to call a public
meeting at the '■school gvmnasium to
be held on Mondsv, October 30. 1939
at 8:00 o’clock in the evening, at
which time the hoard will be prepared
to furnish those interested with all thr
available information which it has.
Milk Control Reenacted
Wisconsin’s milk control law. first
enacted in 1933. received a new lease
on life until the end of 1941 when Governor
Heil signed a bill which modified
and extended the present Uw which
would have expired at the end of this
year.
The law permits the department of
agriculture and markets to regulate
milk prices in districts when- pro
ducers and dealers asked for such reg
ulation. ,
The new law, however, exempts
cities, villages and towns of the fourth
class, (less than 10.000 population) in
counties of less than 70.000 population
from the provisions of the law

Hospital Insurance Plan
Wisconsin’s first effort to put into
effect a state-wide low-cost hospitalization
insurance plan is now under
way with Dr. J. Newton Sisk, acting
secreUry of the Wisconsin HospiUl
Service Assn., Inc., sending out applications
for membership to 82 hospitals
in the state outside Milwaukee
Under the present plan employed
single persons will be able to get hospital
insurance for $9 a year and mar*
ried persons and their dependents for
$18 dollars a year.
Subscribers would be allowed 21
days hospital service each year in
participating hospiUls. They would
be allowed bed and board in a two or
more bed ward; general nursing service,
operating room use, surgical
dressings, drugs, etc., not to exceed
$8; $8 laboratory service; $15 X-ray
examinations; $10 anesthesia; and 10
day maternity confinement.
Hospitalization for tuberculosis,
quarantirmble diseases, mental diseases.
mental disorders, special nurse
fees, anti out-patient service would not
be included in the plan.
HospiUls in Milwaukee differed
with the association on questions of
w-hether to make the operating insurance
corporation an agent of the hospiUls
or to have the corporation hold
contracts directly with the subscriber
and be fully responsible for fulfilling
the contract. Milwaukee hospiUls
favor the former plan, and have announced
the setting up of nine hospitals
under it. Dr. Sisk and the association
favor the latter plan.

Sunday night sent police checkin* a
Milwaukee man alleged to have struck
Sanford Iverson, of this village, while
he was viewing the damage done to
his car in an accident a few miles east
of Wittenberg.
Iverson and I^awrence Koch, West
Allis, collided at the intersection of
highways 45 and 29, both going west
as they side-swiped each other.
The third car, traveling north on
45, turned into the intersection and
struck and injured Iverson as he stood
near his car. Witnesses told County
Traffic Officer SUnley Brown that the
car continued along 29, but was overtaken
about a mile from the scene as
Iverson was being Uken to a doctor's
office in this village for first aid.
The driver then gave his name as
Al Herman, 22 E. Armour street,
Cudahy. The car is licensed, however,
in the name of Walter Hanson, 541 N.
20th street, Milwaukee. Brown said
he had checked all available records
of auto transfers without finding one
concerning such a license.
Iverson, who suffered the fracture
of several ribs and received a number
of bruises on his legs, is confined to
bed at his home.

mWith the achievement at last of Germany's

reason for (its) withdrawal from the
League of Motions is eliminated . . . Thus,
after three years I look upon the struggle

This was a speech by Fuehrer
Adolf Hitler, but not the speech he
made before the reichstag on October
6. It was made March 7, 1936,
when Germany reoccupied the
Rhineland. But it was unpacked
from British-French mothballs this
month as one important reason why
the allies would not accept Der
Fuehrer’s latest peace overture. In
three years they had learned too
m uch about his “ promises.”
While intermittent fighting continued
on the western front (See THE
W A R it Europe’s battles continued to
be diplomatic ones. Russia mopped
up busily in the Baltic (see below),
taking time off to throw in a good
word for Germany. Briefly, it looked

like the much-ridiculed Rome-Berlin-
Moscow triangle was at least holding
together long enough to place
B rita in and France firmly over a
barrel.
Herr Hitler was not so brash as
to offer definite peace terms; a blunt
refusal would have hurt his prestige.
B ut he did drop hints about colonies
Germany lost in the World war,
politely offering in return to join a
disarm am ent move and restore Poland
under Russo-German suzerainty.
(One report said Germans repatriated
from Baltic slates uould be settled in a
tectum of Polund: that another section
would be allotted to Jews; that still a
third section would be given to Poles.)
A few days later, while Europe
waited for somebody to do almost
anything, unofficial German q uarters
hinted that President Roosevelt
m igh t make a good mediator. This
got a cold shoulder not only in Washington,
but also in London and P aris,
where allied leaders stood firm.
Benito Mussolini, who had been heralded
as a mediator, also kept his
silence.
Finally it was bold, impolite and
uninhibited Russia that broke the
silence. Said I?vestia: “One may
respect or hate Hitlerism or any
other system . . . But to begin a
war for the extermination of Hitlerism
means to admit crim inal silliness
in policy.”
Moscow Sphere
Russia showed sim ilar boldness in
her own rejuvenated foreign policy.
With tiny Estonia and Latvia completely
under her domination, she
moved on Lithuania and won the
same concessions—pacts of “ mutual
assistance” and military-transport
privileges. A good sign that
Joseph Stalin had outsmarted Adolf
Hitler was the shipment, bag and
baggage, of 120,000 Germans from
Latvia to the Fatherland. German
minority problems are usually
solved by annexation of the territory
in which they live.
(In Rome, there uere signs this repatriation
u ih breaking up th>' a tis. Said
Milan's Corner Della Seia “After seven
centuries of battle against Slav influence,
thr German minorities which acted as
sentinels of northeast Europe retreat, giving
up their /MtsLs to R u s s ia n s A t Eerrors,
the newspaper Corriere Padano descended
its mailed dsi on Soi iets in general,
calling Communists "living monsters"
and “models of i ulgar bestiality.n
Its tenet: “Italians are born anti-Communists
and want to remain anti-Communists")
Russia moved next on shivering
Finland, where Foreign Minister Eljas
Erkko had the problem of his
lifetime. Russia had “ demanded”
that Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia
come to Moscow; Finland was more
politely “ invited.” First Finnish reaction
was to be insulted. Eljas
Erkko explained Finland considered
iherself a Scandinavian nation, not
• mere Baltic state. But the tune
changed later when Russia seemed
bent on winning naval-air rights on
Hogland island in the Gulf of F in land,
and the Aaland islands between
Finland and Sweden. It
looked like the first request might
be granted, which would enhance
still further Josef Stalin’s Baltic
domination over Adolf Hitler.
War jitters spread like wildfire
throughout northern Europe however.
Sweden, whose peaceful neutrality
is a tradition, was so frightened
by Russia’s threats against
Finland that bombproof shelters
were erected. Troop demobilizations
scheduled October 15 were
cancelled and the entire Tome valley
along the Swedish-Finnish frontier
was blacked out for air raid
practices.
Coming still closer to the Nazi
lair, Russia began weaning little
Hungary away from the anti-Commitern
pact. A new minister, Josef
Kristoffy, was appointed from Budapest
to Moscow to resume the trade
relations broken last February.
Meanwhile Turkish Foreign Minister
Sukro Saragoglu stayed on in
Moscow, handling formation of a
neutral Black sea bloc which could
help Russia in her threatened drive
toward British-dominated Afghanistan.
Between the devil and the
sea, Turkey also initialed a mutual
aid pact in the eastern Mediterranean
with Britain and France.
T HE W A R :
Football, Speeches
Across the Moselle river from
Remich, Luxembourg, French and
G erman troops ceased fighting one
bright October Sunday afternoon to
watch a football game between
Remich and a nearby village. To
the east, in the Saar basin, German
amplifiers shouted Adolf Hitler's
Reichstag speech across no-man’s
land to the French trenches.
This w’as merely a calm before
the storm. Being smart, allies had
resolved not to throw away m anpower
on foolish salients; instead,
they would hold the Reich to a
standstill while the British blockade
was doing its economic work on the
North sea. Nazis, for their part,
awaited acceptance or rejection of
Der Fuehrer's peace feelers.
When it became evident the allies
wanted no peace, activity increased
precipitously. Both Berlin and London
reported British w-arships had
battled Nazi bombing planes in the
North sea, while another report stated
a German naval squadron had
ventured from port to do battle w’ith
the allied fleet. Allied observation
planes saw huge troop movements
toward the front lines, W'hile Nazi
artillery doubled its fire on French
front line positions. Was this the
prelude to a real war?
L A B O R :
Convention
One of war’s reactions in the U. S.
has been popularization of patriotism
and denunciation of reds, H itlerites
and Fascists. Texas’ Rep.

committee got going hotter and
heavier than ever, threatening to
publish a list of communists in government

opportunity of a convention spotlight
at Cincinnati to speak on the subject.
Said he:
“ Communists, Fascists and Nazis
are the people who denounce democracy
as a failure . . . The Stalinists
have cried out against the
dangers of Fascism and Naziism—
and the Hitlerites have screamed
. . . against communism. But now
the essential fraud . . . has been
exposed. Hitler and Stalin have become
partners.”
But A. F. of L. did more than bait
reds. Its executive council was expected
to suspend the International
Typographical union for failure to
chip in on the 1037 “ war chest” to
fight C. I. O. It talked about asking
President Roosevelt to mediate
in Europe’s war and discussed the
touchy subject of whether to back
the President for a third term.
Ohio’s Sen. "Robert A. Taft, a G. O.
P. presidential hopeful, took the opportunity
to plump for N LRB
changes, long favored by A. F. of L.
and opposed by C. I. O. But little
was done on the biggest problem
confronting labor, that of peace. The
battle of A. F. of L. versus C. I. O
seemed destined to go on.
At San Francisco, John Lewis
opened his own convention with a
20.000 word speech ignoring a truce
with A. F. of L. and panning that
“ whisky drinking old m a n ” again,
John Nance Garner. Said Laborman

Much of it artificially inspired,
about 80 per cent of early

of the embargo against arms shipments

a few weeks more than half the

Britain needs agricultural

folks are wondering how Secretary

to hold onto his job . . .
The most militant support
the President is receiving in
his arms embargo fight is coming
from the senators he tried
vigorously to purge.

A blunder?
the 90-day credit provisions w’ere
eliminated. Thus they w-ould approve
“ cash-and-carry” in modified
form, meaning that belligerents
could buy anything except m u nitions
and carry them away, provided
they pay cash.
Some observers believed it was
more a matter pf flagging interest
than isolationist defeat, though the
tw'o factors m ight be tied together.
Fervent speeches by Isplationists
Borah, Vandenberg and Overton had
failed to arouse national zeal for the
embargo. Moreover, there was a
growing feeling that congress should
quit orating and vote one way or
the other, thus clearing the way for
unfinished domestic business. To top
it off, New Hampshire’s Sen. Charles
W. Tobey called for a vote to recomm
it the bill for separation of the
arms embargo from other sections.
Some isolationists called this a
blunder, for it forced a test of their
strength. Repealists, too, were skeptical,
until Sen. Key P ittm an predicted
his side had 65 senate votes
sewed up to floor the Tobey motion.
Everything considered, it looked
like Senator Tobey had pulled the
plug from under a meaningless flood
of oratory.
But the plug was hard to loosen.
A vote on the Tobey resolution was
postponed when C alifornia’s Sen.
Sheridan Downey held the floor four
hours with an isolationist speech.
Then Colorado's Sen. Edwin C. Jo h nson
moved for a three-day recess so
the President could act on European
peace feelers which suggested that
he be mediator (See EUROPE).
DE F EN SE :
War's Reaction
What happens on continental E u rope
when the war is ended concerns
few Americans. But should
France and Britain capitulate, return
Germany's pre-World war colonies
in Africa and hand over their
fleets. Nazidom's strength in the Atlantic
would become a fierce threat.
Although the current $2,000,000,000
national defense appropriation will
give the U. S. a navy capable of
licking any foe, militarists now realize
more than ever that it cannot
simultaneously lick two foes, one in
the Atlantic and the other in the
Pacific.
Reborn this month, therefore, is
talk of a two-ocean navy. Thinking
in terms of the worst possible job
that m igh t confront them, naval
forces are plugging for an additional
$3,000,000,000 to be appropriated
by the next regular congress.

grees, his job got tough when Germany
started the World war. The
militarists back home pooh-poohed
his warnings that their course was
leading the U. S. into war. Said he:
“ They (the Wilhelmstrasse) knew a
repetition of the Lusitania incident
. . . would automatically mean war
with the U. S. But they would not
listen.” On February 3, 1917, Johann
von Bernstorff was handed his passport.
Later minister to Turkey, a
reichstag member under the new republic,

WASHINGTON.—Britain will need
a lot of agricultural implements
from the United States, according to
well-informed British sources here.
No precise estimates have been
made, they stated, but it will run
to around $50,000,000.
The point is that the submarine
menace, plus the airplane menace
to merchant shipping, is now recognized
as the most important f 'tor
in the whole war. It boils do. i to
the question of whether the Germans
can starve Britain or not—the
same question that was so important
in 1917.
B rita in’s agricultural acreage is
now estimated at only 9,039,000. At
the close of the World war at least
3,000,000 acres were under cultivation
for food, which are now idle.
Actually, some experts think the
acreage could be pushed up to 15,-
000,000. This seems doubtful to
American experts here, not becausc
of any special knowledge they have
on the situation but because they
are convinced that Britain pretty
nearly went the limit in cultivating
idle ground capable of food production
in the closing years of the
World war.
But to put land under cultivation,
which has not been used for crops
for 20 years, requires more m a chinery,
per acre, than land which
has been continuously in production,
for obvious reasons. And there has
been very little replacement because
I the number of acres cultivated in
Britain has been shrinking.
T h e n t h e J o k e r A p p e a rs
I n th e H i r a m J o h n s o n A c t
Now for the joker! The British
who are talking about all this in
Washington are w’ondering how they
can get around the H iram Johnson
act, and finance these purchases of
agricultural machinery in the United
States. One plan being considered
is to organize a corporation
to be called the British-
American Agricultural
Im plem ent
company, or something
of the sort. It
would presumably
be a private company,
and intended to
make a profit out of
buying and selling
agricultural m achinery
— on time. It
would buy the m a chinery'
from the im plement
m anufacturers,
paying cash, and sell the
implements in Britain, on credit, the
ostensible intention being that when
the debts were paid by the British
farmers there would be a nice profit
on the whole transaction.
Actually, however, the stock would
not be offered with much of a profit
sales talk. It could be circularized
without running afoul of securities
and exchange commission regulations,
because there would be no
glittering promises held out.
The appeal would be almost exclusively
to persons who would,
were it not for the Johnson act, be
buying British bonds, more to make
a contribution to British success, or
against Hitler, than to m ake money.
The idea would also be to keep the
British government as far away
from the whole affair, officially, as
possible, though actually the desire
for a private blessing from the British
government would be strong.
But the most interesting phase of
the whole business is not that American
farm machinery makers may
get a little business, or that there
! may be loopholes in the Johnson
act, but that certain elements in
Britain already realize that the biggest
question in the w’hole w-ar is
whether or not B ritain can be
starved.

For a long time, whenever a group
of New Dealers were discussing personalities
in the administration in a
social gathering, provided of course
that certain persons were not present,
one would hear w'onder that Secretary
of War Harry H. Woodring
could not take a hint. Why, the
New Dealers would ask, d id n’t the
Kansan realize that he simply did
not fit into the picture, and resign?
If one listened to them and believed,
one would be convinced that
the only reason President Roosevelt
did not throw Woodring out on his
ear was that Roosevelt's heart was
too soft. He could not bear to hurt
the feelings of anyone at once close
to him and loyal.
So long as Woodring** father-inlaw,
Marcus A. Coolidge. had a vote
in the senate, this was generally
thrown in as another explanation.
Especially as everyone in Washington
knew that Senator Coolidge had
old-fashioned ideas about two and
tw’o m aking four, and distrusted—
from a long and successful business
experience—many of the New
Deal economic theories.
But Coolidge’s term expired, and
young Henry Cabot Lodge took his
place, so this theory had to be abandoned.
Thereupon an entirely new
explanation, in addition to the President’s
hatred of saying unkind
things to his friends, was evolved.
This was that the President and
Mrs. Roosevelt were very fond of
Mrs. Woodring, Senator Coolidge’s
daughter, and wanted to keep her in
Washington’s official life!
Be that as it may, and nobody
would deny that the Woodrings are
a couple of delightful people, the
New Dealers, up to a very short
time ago, were all for throwing
Woodring out and all for putting
Louis A. Johnson, assistant secretary
of war, in his place. So, it
m ight be said, was Louis Johnson.
T h in g s H a p p e n H e r e a n d
T h e r e a n d C h a n g e s R e s u lt
But things happened abroad, and
m any things at home have changed
as a result. The New Dealers no
longer want Woodring thrown out.
Certainly they do not want h im
thrown out if Louis Johnson is to
take his place. They play up now
the alleged rows between Woodring
and Johnson, but always with the
thought now that such “ insubordination”
should not be tolerated!
The answer is simple. Louis Jo h n son
is one of the m en in the administration
who believes that the
United States should be prepared—
just in case—for war. So far many
of the left wingers agree with him.
But to their horror the New Dealers
discovered that Johnson’s pet
w’ar industries board had prepared
a lot of plans for mobilizing industry
in the event of war which apparently
had no thought whatever
of social and economic reform.
They were based on the idea of
co-ordinating and expanding existing
privately ow'ned industries. Not a
w'ord about nationalization of the
electric industry, or government
munitions plants. Apparently the
war and navy departments were not
so much interested in preventing
anyone from making a profit as they
were in getting what they needed!

It is a perfect demonstration of
the old adage that politics makes
strange bedfellow’s that the most
m ilitant support President Roosevelt
is receiving in his fight to repeal
the embargo on the sale of
“ arms, am m unition and implements
of w ar” to belligerents is coming
from the very senators the President
tried so vigorously, but unsuccessfully,
to liquidate in 1938.
It was Sen. M illard E. Tydings of
Maryland against whom the President
not only backed R
David J . Lewis but
actually invaded the
state and spoke for
him , who told peace :>w
at any price heck- J p i
lers just what he jP
thought of them. The
two most important
gains the pro-repeal
side made were Senators
Walter F. PJ
George of Georgia *
and Ellison D. (Cot- Senator
ton Ed) Smith of Tydings
South Carolina, who triumphed over
the purge despite the utmost efforts
of the “ janisaries.” Incidentally, the
President spoke in both Georgia and
South Carolina in that campaign.
Leaders of the conservative Southern
Democrats, that group which
is more distasteful to the Corcorans
and the Cohens than anything except
the electric utility magnates,
are Senators Carter Glass and Harry
F. Byrd of Virginia. Neither of
them happened to come up for reelection
in 1938, or they would certainly
have been subjected to a
purge prim ary. As it was, a New
Dealer, W illiam E . Dodd J r ., ran
against a Byrd congressman in the
Alexandria district, and was defeated
three to one, while a New Dealer
was unseated in another primary
that year by a Byrd organization
candidate for the house.
Foes Assist P re s id e n t
I n H is T o u g h e st R a ttle
Glass and Byrd are both enthusiastically
for repeal of the arms embargo.
So is Sen. Edward R. Burke
of Nebraska, who also did not have
to face a prim ary in 1938, but comes
up for re-election next year. It had
been figured that Burke would certainly
be marked for slaughter, and
m ight have great difficulty, what
with Sen. George W. Norris and the
administration both against him.
But now’ Burke fought side by side
with Uncle George ond supported
the President in one of the toughest
battles the White House has staged
on Capitol Hill.
O f course all the “ me too” boys
are with the President. But they
always are, and hence do not rate
m uch credit. I t ’s the m an who
helped you last in politics who seems
the most im portant—not the man
who helped you two years ago. and
never the m an who has always been
with you. Especially if the m an who
helped you last came as an almost
unhoped for and unexpected addition
to the force you were contemplating.
What is all this going to do to the
campaign next year? Most politicians
figure that the President inteads
to run again

EW Y O R K .—As we get it, Amos

O n ly T h a t B o y t do not pray
G iv e Their Best that they may

they may do their best. That would
be considerable for any outfit trained
by Mr. Stagg.
When his short-end College of the
Pacific team turned in a seeming
miracle recently by defeating the
University of California, all reports
agreed that the game was won on
m erit and not through any outside
help.
As the old saying goes, “ A
wise old m a n ’s shadow is worth
more than a young buzzard’s
sword.” Mr. Stagg, now 77 years
old. is, indeed, wise in strategy
and diligent in performance. l!e
hus contributed to the game the
triple pass, the fake pass, the
unbalanced line, the flanking formation
and several other dangerous
devices, and he has come
along through the era of change
a jum p or two ahead of his rivals
in mastering and teaching
the long pass and the open formation,
much more adaptable
than any of the elder statesmen
of world politics. He says
change and experiment have
vastly improved football.
This writer once knew an oldtim
er w’ho w’orked with young Amos
Alonzo Stagg when he was the
champion hay-shoveler on the salt
marshes around Newark bay. My
informant said young Stagg would
figure out a nice leverage on the
fork handle, and move more hay
with less effort than any other man
of the lot. He saved his earnings
and went to Yale Theological school.
After his graduation, he found public
speaking difficult, turned away
from the m inistry and became a
coach at the Y. M. C. A. college
at Springfield, Mass.
In 1892, he went to Chicago
and for 40 years was not only a
team builder but a “ character
builder.** He forbade liquor, tobacco
and profanity, and made
it stick. Seven years ago, he
left Chicago because of the retirement-
at-70 rule, renewed his
gentle exhortations at the College
of the Pacific. He keeps
fit by tennis and a jog up and
down the road every day.

L-l AVE you ever wished to r a
* 1 small, low table that would
appear from nowhere and disappear
again when you were
through with it? Have you ever
thought it would be nice if F a ther’s
ottoman could be folded up
and put out of the way when not
in use? O r perhaps you have unpacked
a suit case in a guest
room and wished for something
other than the bed; a chair or
the floor to put it on during the
process?
A cam p stool plus a tray to fit
the top makes a very satisfactory
sm a ll table to place beside a
game table or to set up for your
books or mending basket by your
favorite chair. But be sure to
dress it up so that it will look its
best either when in use or when
folded up and placed in some
out of the w’ay corner. A rem nant
of m ate rial and some upholstery
braid will do the trick.
Stain and wax are suggested for
the base as paint might be m arred
in folding the stool.

from the world court in 1928
to compile 75 volumes covering international
law and neutrality in the
World war.
In 1922, after 37 years of pondering
these matters, he wrote:
“ So long as we love glory, so

not raise their sons as food for

Mr. Moore vigorously opposed the
Kellogg pact and all other such devices

who offer them. As befits an authority
on neutrality, he parts his

C H A P T E R V I—Continued
The Resident was in his office,
reasonably civil, but he frowned
when Norwood told him about the
palace supper.
“ You met the Hardings, I suppose?
What did you make of them ?”
“ Tourists. Beautiful niece. Terrible
aunt. I gathered, without being
told, that the aunt has money."
“ Rundhia show up? Did you notice
anything suggestive of the poslib
ility of scandal?”
“ I thought the niece a damned
nice girl, sir. A bit romantic.
“ Any conversation with the M ah
a ra ja h ? ”
“ Yes. I was alone with him until
midnight. He showed me all the
documents that he seems to think
bear on his claim to own that temple
property. He seems very anxious
to avoid a lawsuit, and it isn’t
difficult to guess why, though I ’m
not a lawyer. He showed me nothing
that even half persuaded me he
has a c a s ^ against the priests. Of
course, we’ll know more when we’ve
run the survey. But as far as I ’ve
gone, I should say the priests have
a walk-over.”
“ You sound prejudiced.”
“ I haven’t a trace of prejudice,
sir, one way or the other.”
“ Why not reserve your opinion?
Are you off now to call on the M ah
a r a ja h ? ”
“ Yes. I ’m a bit early, but I have
something to do on the way.”
“ Very well. Keep me posted.”
C H A P T E R V II
Norwood left his horse in charge
of the sais at the palace front gate.
He intended to return and ride up
the long drive to the front door for
his formal call on the Maharajah.
But the footpath to the guesthouse
was shorter than the winding carriage-
road, so he walked, to leave
the iodine for Mrs. Harding. On the
way he saw Lynn and Rundhia.
Lynn was no longer in riding
breeches. She looked delicious in
a frock of nile-green print and a
wide leghorn hat. Norwood wasn’t
sure, but he suspected she knew
she could be seen from the guesthouse
veranda, and that Rundhia
did not know. She and Rundhia
were laughing. Suddenly Rundhia
snatched her hat off, used it as a
shield to hide behind, caught her
in his arm s and kissed her. It was
no fool of a kiss. It was an experience.
Lynn did m ake a show of resistance.
She struggled free and
recovered her hat.
Norwood’s view of it, against the
background of the leghorn hat, made
him set his jaw . But he relaxed it
again and smiled, a bit grimly, a
bit maliciously. From the opposite
direction he had heard what sounded
like an oath, although it was
nothing worse than the well-bred, almost
inarticulately gurgled word:
“ H ussy!”
Aunty Deborah Harding had also
seen that lingering and only laughingly
resisted kiss.
Aunty was on the screened veranda,
propped on pillows, on a
reed chaise longue, with a table
beside her. A native servant was
just in the act of removing a tray
of breakfast things.
“ May I approach," asked Norwood,
“ or are you p urd ah?”
“ Who is it? I can’t see you. Oh,
yes, Captain Norwood, come in if
you can bear the sight of me. I
should look presentable. I never
had so m any women in all my life
to push and pull me about. This is
m y second attempt at a meal this
morning. Y o u ’ll have to run away
if I can’t keep it down. What haa
brought you, pray, at this hour?”
He had forgotten the iodine.
“ Thought I ’d ask how you’re coming
along.”
“ Will you bring m y niece here?
She’s beyond those trees, talking to
someone. I want her to come here
and talk to me. Will you tell her I
said so, and please don't take no
lor an answer.”
Norwood strolled across the lawn,
tapping his boots with a riding whip.
He coughed a couple of limes. By
the time he had peered around the
trees, Lynn and Rundhia were seated
opposite each other on wickerwork
chairs. Lynn seemed unselfconscious.
Rundhia looked venomously
sly; he offered Norwood no
greeting whatever.
“ I happened to be calling on your
au nt,” said Norwood, “ and she
asked me to say that she wants to
see you—”
Lynn looked dubious: “ What sort
of mood is she in ? ”
“ Very polite to m e,” said Norwood.
“ That’s a danger signal. She can’t
be polite to one person at a time. I
think I won’t go.”
“ You will have to pardon m e ,"
said Norwood, “ but I agreed to
bring you.”
“ You always do what you say you
w ill? ”
“ Yes.” He looked straight at R undhia,
who ignored him.
“ Prince R u n d h ia ,” said Lynn, “ is
going to show me the jewel room.”
“ Is he?” said Norwood.
Rundhia winced noticeably: “ Perhaps
you’d better go,” he said to
Lynn. “ There’s lots of time. She’ll
have her tantrum out, and you can
meet me later.”
Lynn compared them, as clearly
as if she had said it aloud. Her
“ Write a letter, why don’4 you?”
smile w'as a bit forced when her
eyes met Norwood’s:
“ Do you always order people?”
she demanded. “ Don’t you ever
say please?”
He laughed. “ I can’t kneel.
Breeches too tight.”
“ What will you do if I won’t
come?”
“ Scre am ," he answered.
“ I dare you.”
“ Tuesday is m y day for screaming.
Are you game to wait here
until Tuesday?”
“ No. I ’m coming w’ith you.” She
glanced at R undhia: “ You’ll excuse
u s?”
“ I excuse you,” he answered.
Norwood looked so comfortless
that Lynn noticed it:
“ What are you worried about?”
“ Oh, nothing. I was wondering
what your aunt eats.”
She laughed at him . “ L ia r! That’s
the very first time you haven’t spoken
like a polished ram rod .”
“ I told part of the truth. I am
worried about you.”
“ You needn’t be. I ’m all right.”
She ran forward to speak to her
aurt. The tray of breakfast things
was being carried out by a palace
servant. Norwood stopped the man,
inspected the tray, and selected a
piece of toast. He looked for something
to wrap it in. That reminded
him . He groped in his left-hand
pocket for thc iodine, tore off half
the paper in which Stoddart had
w'rapped the bottle, stuffed the untidy
package back, wrapped the
toast in the torn-off paper and put
that into his right-hand pocket.
“ I ’m expected at the palace, so
I can’t stay, Mrs. Harding. I
brought you some fresh iodine, in
case the doctor’s stuff is pretty ancient,
as sometimes happens.”
He plunged his hand into his tunic
pocket and Lynn came to the screen
door to receive the bottle. He looked
at her, groping with his left hand,
trying to pull out the bottle without
the untidy paper; but a piece of
string, tied with one o f Stoddart’s
knots, prevented. So he pulled out
the disgraceful package with a
quick smile of apology.
“ H ello," said Lynn, “ you’ve
dropped something.”
He stooped, picked up what lay at
his feet but didn’t recognize it. It
was a quite sm all black paper envelope.
“ I saw it fall from your pocket,”
said Lynn.
He opened it. It contained a neatly
folded paper of diamonds. Nine
large, clear white brilliants shone
in the sun. He scowled at them and
stuffed the package back into his
pocket, evidently upset. He appeared
to hope that Lynn hadn’t seen
the diamonds. He seemed about to
mention them, but changed his
mind. Lynn thought he seemed suspicious
of her. Then suddenly:
“ Excuse me, won’t you?”
He walked away. Lynn’s eyes followed,
wondering. He looked like a
m an who has been hit hard and is
trying not to show it.
“ L ynn,” said her aunt's voice.
“ Yes, Aunty.”
“ Come h e re !"
Lynn faced about: “ Aunt Deborah!
I have seen someone staring
at what he dreaded. Or it seemed
to me so.”
“ Lynn, please rearrange m y p illows.”
It was not Aunty’s cultured, conventional
voice but the hard, unsympathetic
one in which she almost
always commanded attention
to her comfort as a prelude to the
luxury of an explosion of temper.
Two palace women, loaned by the
Maharanee, had been fussing with
the pillows less than five minutes
before. Lynn rearranged them. She
waited. Her silence offered the old
termagant no opening, so Aunty
H ar’ding abandoned her usual gradual
style of attack. She exploded:
“ Don’t dare to speak to me, you
sullied creature, until you have
washed your mouth! There is soap
and water in the bedroom.”
“ Aunty— ! ”
“ Wash your mouth this minute!
I saw you—permitting yourself to
be kissed by Prince R u n d h ia !”
“ Aunty, I ’m no longer five! A ren’t
you forgetting—” *
“ To m y humiliation I remember
too m uch! You are old enough at
least to try to keep up an appearance
of decency.”
“ Aunty, there’s no harm in a kiss
after breakfast! I t ’s kisses after
m idnight that—"
“ Don’t you dare to try to justify
your grossness! Even your graceless
father had enough sense of his
social position to keep his indecencies
out of sig h t!”
“ A unty !”
“ Don’t ‘aunty’ me! You inherit
your father’s w-antonness.”
“ I never knew h im ,” Lynn answered.
“ I only know w’hat you and
other people have told me. Others
seem to have admired him . Wasn’t
he merry and brave and generous?
Would he have endured your injustice?
I have had to. For seventeen
years. Aunty, I am very near the
end of endurance. I knew you were
looking. That is why I let Rundhia
kiss m e ."
Lycn repeated: “ I kissed Prince
Rundhia, in a spirit of fun %nd partly
to defy you.”
“ Fun indeed! Vulgar, suggestive
impropriety, with an Indian prince
whose im m orality is notorious!
Whether or not I disinherit you will
depend—”
L ynn’s rebellion flared to its inevitable
climax. She interrupted:
“ Disinherit me now, if you please!
Do it now, Aunty. I have made
my last submission to your cruel
money! You have educated me so
that I haven’t one chance in a thousand
to earn a living. God knows
what It?an do. But I will find something.
I accept the odds. I will
make a go of it somehow."
A unty’s stare was skeptical, scornful.
Lynn turned away.
"Where are you off to now?"
"T o the palace. The Maharanee
is human. Perhaps she and I can
find something to laugh a t."
"V ery well, Lynn. All your clothes j

She picked up her tennis racket |
and unscrewed the frame. It was
a hardly conscious gesture: it was |
m uch too hot for tennis. She walked |
out through the screen door, carry- .
ing the racket.
As she approached the palace |

“ I feel like a skeleton in my ow t i

laughed.
“ Come and I ’ll show you the treasures.

All the way up the palace stairs
and along the ancient corridor, R u n d
hia chattered gaily. Lynn answered
in monosyllables, perfectly aware
that Rundhia was talking to divert
attention from his motive.
“ Beauty and the beast 1" said
Rundhia.
“ Bromide! Rundhia, you look like
secrets in a suave disguise.”
“ My very inmost heart,” he answered,
“ is an open book. C an’t
you read it? ”
“ I don’t want to ."
He kept his distance. That sinuous
right arm of his behaved itself.
He walked ahead of her through the
narrow anteroom, where two turbaned
guards salaamed respectfully.
Rundhia spoke to one of the
guards, who switched on the electric
light in the treasure room. The
masonry wall was ten feet thick;
the door a foot thick. The guard
ally, is a more effective means of
getting the laggards out of bed than

New Method Preserves PlanU, Insects in Natural Colors
Two methods of preserving indefinitely
in their natural colors such
agricultural specimens as leaves,
flowers, fruits, seeds, insects, and
other biological material have been
developed by chemists of the United
States department of agriculture.
The processes, while supplementing
each other, have different fields of
application—one for dried and the
other for fresh material.
In the method studied by Dr.
Charles E. Sando, specimens are
suspended and embedded in methacrylate,
a crystal-clear plastic similar
to materials used in making
nonshatterable airplane windows.
In this process, the specimens must
be dehydrated or dried out to prevent
moisture from clouding the
glass-like plastic material. They
may be air-dried or dehydrated by
use of alcobok or ether.
Corn and other grains or seeds,
insects, or anything that does not
lose its color or shape with drying,
may be preserved by thi* method,
possibly only under controlled laboratory
conditions. Once the plastic
sets it can be machined and polished
to a high luster so that the
specimen may be viewed from any
angle without distortion. The largest
mount prepared so far is an ear
of hybrid corn.
The other method, developed by
G. R. Fessenden, is a chemical
process for treating fresh plant m a terial
in such a way as to toughen
the tissues and set the natural col- : I‘‘Tin Tr * ^ l i »

preserved by immersion in specially
formulated water - removing
syrups. Each plant species requires
an individual treatment which has
to be worked out from seven general
types of formulas.
The old method of preserving
botanical specimens—pressing and
drying—was unsatisfactory because
of loss of color and the fact they
were easily destroyed by handling
or by insects or mold. Specimens
preserved by this new method are
sealed between sheets of cellulose
film so as to be protected from
damage.
Due to the expected permanence
of specimens preserved by either
method, excellent records of both
healthy and abnormal plants ar>4 insects
may be made available for
scientific research, study, and exhibition.

TH E R E ’S one muscle in the human
anatomy which was named
by a humorist with boarding-house
experience. It is called the “ boarding-
house muscle” because it is the
muscle which enables you to extend
your arm —and reach.
It took its name, of course, from
the dining-tables of boarding-houses,
where to reach far
was to get more to
eat at a table where
everybody was so
engrossed in his
plate he d idn’t have
the time or the inclination
to pass
anything to anyone
else. Reach won.
In business it is
reach also that wins.
One of the chief va lues
of advertising to
the advertiser is that
it gives him a reach for customers.
Every business m ust both reach customers
and reach for them if it is
to exist.
The business m a n whose reach is
longest or most skilled is the m an
who brings the most customers into
his store. And those who reach the
best have the best stores and can
give the best values.
TVte chief concern of every business
is its customers. Who are
they? Where do they live? Why
should they trade with me? How can
Charles Roth
I tell them of the advantages of
m y business? Every business m an
asks these questions. Every successful
business m an answers them.
In the reach for customers, it isn’t
a muscle which does the trick. It
is advertising.
A m an starts a store. Somewhere
are men and women who should
buy from him . He is sincere in his
desire to serve. But unless he does
something about it, his store will
fa il before enough customers find
their way to his doors.
He has to reach out for them. He
begins to advertise where customers
w ill see—in the newspaper. One
reads. He is convinced. He goes
to the store. He is well-treated. He
buys. He likes what he bought. He
returns to buy again.
Gradually, as more advertising
appears, more customers come,
buy, return to buy again. The reach
for customers is building a great
business.
But don’t you see that the business
m an is not the only one who
has benefited in the process?
Every customer who found there
a better place to buy, a place where
he could get a little bit better m erchandise
and a little bit better service
at a little bit better price, also
benefited.
The customer benefits as much
from advertising as the business
m an , if not more.

“ Death in the Foreign Legion”
He l l o , e v e r y b o d y :
Here’s a yarn from North Africa and the Sahara country
—a land that’s always been full of adventure and glamor for us
folks here at home. I got the bug once, and went there looking
for thrills. I—well—I've got to confess that I found more fleas
there than glamor, but I ’ve also got to admit that there’s plenty
of adventure there too. So you can bet your last nickel that
today’s yarn, from Lieutenant Pierre Varges of Queens, N. Y.,
late of the French Foreign Legion, will be one of those tales
that makes your heart pound and your hair stand up on end.
It happened on April 16, 1923, during the uprising of the Riff
Kabilas under the leadership of Abd El Krim. Pierre Varges
was then a ser oant in the 2nd Co., 1st Battalion of the Legion,
stationed at El Harib, Morocco.
April found the 1st battalion on a punitive expedition at
the borders of the Sahara. They had been chasing the Riffs
for some time and finally, on the 16th, they came upon them
entrenched in the hills just at daybreak. They were sniping at the
legionnaires, and doing quite a bit of damage. Several times the legionnaires
tried to di ive them from their position—but to no avail. Finally,
the captain of thc second company received orders from the commanding
officer to dislodge them at all cost.
S e c o n d C o m p a n y G e ts O r d e r s to A d v a n c e .
The second company started to advance. Orders to charge
were passed down the line to the section officers. The legionnaires
spread out fanwise and waited for the captain’s whistle. The
Arabs, sensing what was coming, redoubled their flre. The whistle
sounded. The charge was on!
‘‘I have a hazy memory of what followed,” says Pierre. ‘‘The
■creams of the wounded and the sickening noises of the bullets make
you forget you are human. The world ceases to be, and you become
an automaton intent on one purpose—to kill. My section was one of the
first—way out in front—and, sacred pig, that charge was fast. A scream-
The police sergeant looked at the
newest recruit and shook his head.
“ You have been on the force for
several months now, and never
| once brought in a case,” he said.
The constable hung his head.
"N ow ,” went on the sergeant,
| "th e squire up at the hall has just
phoned to say that somebody is
stealing apples from his orchard.
Go up there tonight and watch for
| the thief.”
After watching near the hall for
some time the constable saw a m an
| slinking along with a sack on his
back. He pounced on him, opened
| the sack, and emptied a quantity
of silver on to the ground.
“ H ’m ,” he said, after surveying
the spoils, “ my mistake. You can
thank your lucky stars it wasn't
apples.”

m y men fell writhing at m y feet. No tim e to stop to help. Then, suddenly,
the world seemed to explode in my head. Darkness! The e n d !”
Pierre says he will never be sure what happened between then and
two a. m. of the following day, but at that hour he started to regain
consciousness. " I tried to open my eyes,” he says, "b u t they felt as if
they were glued shut. I ju st couldn't move them. Panic seized me. I
did n 't know if I was dead or alive. There seemed to be a terrible weight
on top of me—all over me. I tried to move my arms and m y legs, but
I couid not. I tried to call for help, but no sounds came from my
throat. No doubt I was dead.”
Seconds passed. Pierre's brain began to clear. He noticed he
was breathing—and dead men didn't breathe. Then, slowly, the
horror of the situation began to dawn on him. He wasn't dead.
H E WAS B I R I E D A L IV E !
Right then and there, Pierre went insane. “ I yelled and
screamed like a thousand furies.” he says. “ I heard a shot— a
series of muffled sounds— then silence again. Once more I lost
consciousness. For how long, I don't know, but when I again
awoke I was on a cot in the field hospital of our post. My head
was swathed in bandages, and I was tied to the cot—still unable
to move.”
D o c to r E x p l a i n s T e r r ib le R id e to P ie r r e .
What had happened? Had he been having a nightmare? Pierre
turned his head, though it pained him to do it, and looked about the
tent. In the next cot lay a private, tied to his cot in the same fashion
as Pierre was. Pierre spoke to him, but he didn’t answer. Then he
called louder—just to hear his own voice. Alter all he had been through
he wasn’t even sure he had one. At the sound, the doctor, the captain,
and a male attendant entered. The doctor spoke a few words with the
captain, then both of them approached Pierre’s bed. “ Well, old fellow,”
said the captain, “ how is the living dead m a n ? ”
Those words came so close to confirming Pierre’s own suspicions
that they frightened h im . “ The captain saw that I was
upset—saw that I didn't grasp the meaning of his words," says
Pierre, “ so he proceeded to explain. A ricochette bullet had
struck me in the right temple producing a ghastly looking wound
which knocked me unconscious. The stretcher bearers, thinking
me dead, put me on the dead wagon that is used to cart all
corpses to the legion post.
“ As the casualties that day were extraordinarily heavy, they placed
the bodies on top of one another. The reason I could not move when I
regained consciousness was that I was buried beneath a dozen or more
of my dead companions.”
About the tim e the captain got to that part of his story, Pierre put
in a question.
“ But. mom capitaine,” he Interrupted, "w h at of my eyes? I
was unable to open them .”
“ Naturally,” the captain answered. “ Your face was covered
with the blood of your dead comrades which seeped down from
above. The blood coagulated over your face and completely
sealed your eyes and even your nostrils. It is a miracle that
you did not suffocate entirely.”
At that moment, the legionnaire, tied to the cot beside Pierre’s,
let out an unearthly scream. The doctor went to him and gave h im an
opiate. The captain nodded toward him and said to Pierre. "Y o u had
a most horrible experience, m y friend, but that one is even more upset
than you over it. That is the sentry who was on duty near the dead
wagon when you let out those so terrifying screams.”

caster and York after this act.
Another conflict in which the rose
was worn was the Seven Years war.
During the Battle of Minden in 1759,
several British regiments gathered
and wore roses which flourished on
the countryside, it is related in G a rden
Digest. It is a custom for remaining
British regiments to celebrate
the battle in which their predecessors
fought, by wearing yellow
roses and bedecking their drums
and colors.
The Lancashire Fusiliers make
even more of a ceremony of it. by
giving a “ silent toast” to those who
fell. Most peculiar of all is the
ritual which follows the toast. The
most recently joined subalterns
must stand upon their chairs and
eat a rose.

Important Fashions
In Simple Patterns
T H E smock-frock is really a
1 fashion, not just a comfortable
maternity dress. It s smart and
young and practical. No. 1833 is
a version of it that may be worn
for afternoon, because the pleats,
in both the smock top and the adjustable
slip skirt, give it a touch
of dressiness. Make it of flat
crepe, thin wool or georgette.
Good for a Whole Wardrobe.
Unusually useful is the pretty
froclr for little girls (1836) because
it can be made in two ways—with
round collar and frills, or with the
plain square neckline. Therefore
you can thriftily m ake a whole
wardrobe for your own small
daughter, by using this simple
pattern again and again. School
cottons, like gingham or linen, as
well as challis and jersey, are
smart fabrics for it.
The Patterns.
No. 1833 is designed for sizes 14,
16, 18, 20, 40 and 42. Size 16 requires

By H IL D A R IC HM ON D
C E V E N mothers were busily sew-
^ ing in the living-room, while
outside under the open windows
their children played noisily. There
had been a call for children’s garments
for a large fam ily whose
home had been destroyed by fire.
The sewing machines raced and needles
flashed. Presently the children,
exhausted from a wild game, sat
down on the grass to rest, and their
shrill young voices carried into the
living-room at a tim e when the
sewing machines happened to be silent.
“ My mother never, never would
do such a th in g !” were the first
words that were heard. “ If I had
been bad like Jim m y , she would
have called me home, and if I ’d had
to be punished nobody would have
seen it."
“ Mine, too,” agreed three more
young critics.
“ I ’m glad my mother doesn’t do
things like that,” spoke up a very
earnest young voice. “ And another
thing she never does is to make me
sit still when there’s company.”
“ No,” interrupted another, “ if I
come in with my hands and face
washed clean and shake hands, then
my mother tells m i I may be excused
to go and p lay.”
“ That’s the way my mother does.
R u th ’s mother makes her sit still
the whole time and it’s awful h ard .”
“ Ruth would be as careful as anybody,
when there is company, not
to get noisy if her mother would—”
“ Yes, my goodness! I t ’s hard to
sit still for an hour and have nothing
to play with, and that’s what
R u th ’s mother wants her to do. I
heard her scolding about it.”
“ Well, I ’m glad my mother is not
like Bob’s. Bob never gets a chance
to choose about anything. His mother
decides where he shall go and
what he shall do, whether it’s im portant
or not.”
“ My mother lets me have my say
about most things.”
“ So does m ine .” This last was in
chorus.
Long before this, all conversation
in the living-room had ceased, and
the mothers were listening breathlessly.
“ I ’m afraid they will begin
on our faults if they continue this
open forum ,” said one mother.
Children Ask F air Government.
“ Let them ,” said another. “ It is
doing us good to be praised, and the
hearing of our faults will not hurt
us.”
“ Bless their little hearts,” said a
third, “ I never dreamed they were
such keen observers. And aren’t
they loyal to u s !”
“ And they are right,” said the
hostess. “ I think it is a shame the
way Mrs. Lottey comes out with a
switch in her hand to hunt her children.
She won't injure their bodies
with that little stick, but I ’m
afraid she may injure her opportunity
to gain their confidence, with
her cast-iron methods of governm
e nt.”
“ I ’ll tell you what let’s do,” said
another mother suddenly, wishing
to prevent further criticism of their
neighbor. “ Let’s give our darling
instructors a little treat. I have
some ice cream in the refrigerator,
and it will only take a minute to
bring it over.”
“ Good! I baked fresh cookies this
morning, and they will go nicely
with the ice cream ,” said another.
The children were astonished at
the feast suddenly spread before
them as they sat on the grass, but
they were not too astonished to do
their part with their hearty young
appetites.
“ Such a surprise!”
“ Why didn’t you tell u s?”
“ May we call to Bob and his sister
to come over?”
“ I ’ll say this is sw e ll!”
Chattering and eating, and drinking
quantities of pink lemonade, the
children continued their picnic until
the last drop and crum b were consumed,
while the mothers, sewing
silently, thanked God in their hearts
that their little children saw and appreciated
their loving efforts at fair
government, and they humbly asked
for more light, more patience and
more skill.

Ultraviolet Meat Storage
Longer storage of meat and other
food without spoiling or changes of
color is made possible by the use of
ultraviolet radiation combined with
other more usual food preservation
practices. Professor Arthur W. Ewell
of the Worcester Polytechnic institute
told the American Society of Refrigerating
Engineers at a recent
meeting, according to Science Service.
The germ-killing effect of the
radiation, now being set to work for
bacterial purposes in a dozen different
fields ranging from sterilizing
the air in hospital operating
rooms to the packing industry, can
be attributed to its power of forming
ozone from the oxygen in the
air, Professor Ewell declared.

Moonshiners Are
Forced to Adopt
Chain Operation
Illicit Dittiller* Are Hard
Pressed for Cash in
Mountains.
ATLANTA.—Pappy, the bewhiskered
mountain moonshiner of the
cartoons whose feud guns are rusty
and his cash scarce, has resorted
to “ chain” operation of whisky stills
in an effort to make money on a
losing proposition.
The southeastern division of the
internal revenue alcohol tax unit—
“ revenooers” to Pappy—disclosed
that the traditional mountain distillers
are hard pressed for profit
because of legal liquor and stringent
enforcement.
Some of the illicit whisky makers
have gone into “ chain” operation
because of inability to finance their
ramshackle plants alone. In cases
of “ co-operative effort” one of the
more affluent men in the com m unity
will advance money for grain
and sugar needed in whisky m anufacture.
Then he gets a cut of the
profits when the liquor has been sent
to the city and sold. Recent federal
raids have uncovered “ chains” of
as many as 10 stills.
The days of the private moonshiner
who made a few gallons of
native corn or rye and carefully
aged it for his own consumption
ond occasional sale are over, according
to W. H. Hearington, district
supervisor of the alcohol unit.
‘The Stuff Is Awful.’
“ Frankly, the stuff that is distilled
in the mountains today is awfu
l,” Hearington said. “ Many of
the moonshiners won’t drink their
own product.
“ Most of the stuff is sold im m e diately
after it is distilled because
our agents are crowding the still
operators too close to permit aging.
The ’shine is dumped on the market
almost before it is cold. And that
means the quality is virtually unfit
for human consumption.”
The purity of the native liquor
which retails for about $2 a gallon
is usually doubtful, Hearington said.
The water used in mountain whisky
comes from comparatively pure
streams, but in the "low country”
of the South the moonshiners often
use polluted swamp or pond water.
The chain system of still operation
is not widespread, but agents
in the district of South Carolina,
Alabama, Georgia and Florida have
uncovered recent instances of cooperative
manufacturing—with all
hands denying ownership of the
stills to avoid heavier federal prosecution.
Helps Enforcement.
Federal enforcement is helped
materially by reports of unusually
large sugar sales. Grocers are required
by law to report the sale of
more than 100 pounds. According
to the federal men, 100 pounds of
sugar go into 100 gallons of mash,
which in turn will yield about 10
gallons of whisky.
The distilling equipment in most
cases is inadequate. Condensers for
the alcohol vapor usually are made
from scrapped metal coils, and even
discarded automobile radiators.
Most of the illicit whisky finds its
market in city slums and lowerclass
areas, Hearington said, where
people “ will drink anything.”
The “ drink-anything” type of
tippler has perplexed federal agents
in the South, particularly in Sbuth
Carolina recently, by purchasing denatured
alcohol—the rubbing type—
for drinking purposes. Denatured
alcohol taken internally causes serious
gastric consequences, but the
sales continue. Denatured alcohol
imbibers usually temper the unpalatable
liquid with soft drinks or
water.

Just Homesick for ‘Pen,’
Horse Thief, 80, Asserts
LANCASTER, PA.-Eighty-yearold
Joe Buzzard stood up in court
recently and insisted that he had
committed his latest horse theft just
because he was homesick for Eastern
penitentiary.
Buzzard, whose 34 years in ja il
have included numerous sentences
for horse stealing, told the court
when he was arraigned for stealing
a horse and buggy early this month,
that he was “ homesick for the old
pen.”
“ Give me twenty years or life,
it’s im m aterial to m e ,” he told
Judge Oliver S. Schaeffer.
“ I believe you stole that horse
just to get back,” the court remarked.
“ Positively, your honor,” Buzzard
replied.
In addition to a $50 fine, he will
have from one and one-half to three
years to get over his homesickness
at Eastern penitentiary.
Cow Swallows Cash, Then
Trouble Really Started
R O M E .—There is one farmer in
Italy who has learned to hate cows.
The farmer, Danielo Alghessello,
recently hung up in a stall next to
the cow a vest containing his wallet
with 4,000 lire (over $200) in the
pocket. The cow seized the vest
and ate it.
In the hope of recovering his
money Danielo killed the cow and
examined its stomach, but did not
find the chewed money. So he sold
the meat at less than cost.
Now the local authorities have
fined Danielo for killing a cow without
a license for butchering.
