Income Ta x Increase I m New
Revenue Hill
A $14,000,000 increase in income
taxe* appears to be the solution to the
Republican administration tax problem.
A fte r months of debate and controversy
which at one stage split wide
open tlfchRepublican-Democrat coalition
leaders o f the two parties have
agreed on broadening the Income tax
base to Include more than 112,000 new
taxpayers, and surtax increases fo r all
taxpayers. More than that, several
Progressives have indicated their approval
o f the bill, stating that it is
the best tax measure which has yet
been introduced.
The new surtax levy is expected to
raise 14 millions which will be augmented
by 6 million to be raised by a
2c per package cigarette tax, the only
tax feature that remains in the bill
passed by the assembly more than flve
weeks ago. Thc 20 millions still would
leave a shortage o f about 6 million to
meet budget requirements for the next
two years; however, the administration
hopes to make that up with economies
in state government administration.
Democrats have insisted that
more economies can be effected, and
point to the Schmedeman administration
at which time the budget was less
than 46 million. H eil's budget calls
fo r expenditures o f about 72 million.
The new tax base which cuts down
exemptions and increases rates under
the surtax is expected to assess 112,-
000 new taxpayers about $1.00 to $4.00
each, as well as decisive increases for
present income taxpayers.
Another amendment to the tax bill
strikes out the provisions for reenacting
the present chain store tax. This,
observers point out, indicates that the
administration contemplates a new
chain store tax bill which will include
all Ailing stations. The present chain
store tax raises about $200,000 for the
biennium.
Dairy Tax Revived
There is still a possibility that W isconsin
dairymen will be able to join
and participate in the national dairy
advertising drive. To date, Iowa.
Washington and New York have
passed laws which allow for the deduction
from milk and dairy produce o f I
checks fractional amounts to be used
in a national campaign. Minnesota,
using a slightly different system, has
signed up 82 per cent o f its dairy fa r mers
on pledges to raise the Minnesota
quota.
A bill to allow the deduction o f one1
cent for each pound o f butter fa t in
Wisconsin has passed the assembly.
However, senate opposition to the type
o f bill resulted in the introduction of
a new measure. The new senate bill
is similar. It would assess fanners
cent per pound fo r thirty days. It
is expected that this deduction would
raise $200,000 per year for advertising
and promotional activities. It has
been endorsed by the committee on
agriculture.
This week farmers have been sending
in signed statements to the effect
that they are w illing to contribute at
the rate o f % cent per pound of butter
fa t fo r thirty days of each year
fo r the advertising o f dairy products.
(Estim ates are that this is about thr
equivalent o f ten cents per cow per
year.) Lee I. Yorkson, Wisconsin
D airy Industry Association, urges
farm ers interested in the dairy advertising
program to send in their names
the association in Madison in order to
impress legislators by their approval.
The original assembly bill was onposed
on the grounds that farmers did
not want to cooperate.
# Politics—-Youth Activity
The 1940 election is still months and
months away, but each o f Wisconsin’s
three m ajor political parties have a lready
begun to round their organizations
into shape for the campaign.
This week-end, Saturday and Sunday,
Young Progressives will meet in
Wausau, and hope to create a permanent
state wide organization. Senator
Robert La F ollette will be the princi-l
pal speaker. Young Bob is already
laying the groundwork for his 1940
campaign for reelection. Other speakers
w ill include Senator Phil Nelson,
mentioned as a possible Progressive
candidate for governor, and Assemblymen
A lfonsi and Biemiller, Progres-|
sive flo or leaders.
Young Republicans too get together
this week-end. They will meet in She-!
boygan on Friday and Saturday.*
Frank Gannet, Rochester publisher,
and Governor Heil will be the principal
speakers.
The Young Democrats were the flrst
to assemble. They met in Pelican
Lake three weeks ago and elected
John Slocum, present assembly clerk,
their president. Slocum succeeds j

Ia F ollette Reorganization Finis
Assembly action in concurring with
the Bolen’s bill repeals the remaining
bits o f La Follette reorganization of
state government plan. Introduced
during the first days o f the 1939 ses-1
sion. the renoaler wipes out the direc-1
torship jobs in the public service
department. the tax commission and
abolishes the department o f mental
hygiene. A ll other La Follette reorganization
transfers by executive
order were abolished during the first
10 days o f the session by senate action.
A fte r holding the bill more than 6
months, the assembly concurred and
added nn amendment which excludes
from the repealer all reorganization
bills passed during the nresent session.
Before going to the governor
for s’ arnature the bill must go hack to
the senate for endorsement o f the assembly
added amendment.
The three directors who w ill lose
their iobs if the senate agrees with
amendment and the governor signs

and Grant Haas, department

The abolishment o f the department
o f metsl hygiene returns the administration
of county and state asvlums to
the state board o f control. However,
a bill to form a new department of
public w elfare taking over all welfare
activities has passed the assembly andj
awaits senate action.

F A R M E R S A R E V O T IN G Funeral R ites fo r Myrtle
O N M IL K A G R E E M E N T Kohasky Held on Saturday
D airy farmers in this territory who
are producing grade A milk fo r the
Chicago market, either in the form of
milk or cream, are now voting on the
proposition o f a milk marketing agreement
and order fo r the Chicago market
as proposed by the secretary of
agriculture.
F or those who are delivering their
milk to a cooperative such as the
Consolidated Badger Cooperative, or
the Pure Milk Products Cooperative,
the vote will be made by the directors
of the cooperative and the individual
w ill not have to cast a vote.
Those who are delivering to a plant
which is not cooperative, such as
K ra ft. Borden or Bowman, the individual
vote w ill have to be cast by the
producer.
Ballots should have been received by
each producer directly from Chicago,
but in case any producer has not received
such a ballot, he may obtain
one at the office o f County Agent G.
F. Baumeister.
A ll producers who are expected to j
cast an individual vote should do so be- j
cause it is a general opinion o f those j
who have studied the agreement that
it will be a distinct benefit to the producers
in raising the price o f grade A
milk, dairy leaders have pointed out.
In order fo r the agreement to go
into effect, it is necessary that two- j
thirds o f the producers must favor the
proposition. It is the general opinion
that a milk marketing agreement will j
straighten out the conditions in Chica- j
go fo r grade A milk and cream by preventing
chiseling on the part o f hand-,
lers so that producers will get a f air'
price fo r the high quality o f the milk!
which they are producing. Ballots!
must be in the mail and postmarked
before noon o f Friday, August 26.
That the Chicago Tribune has little j
regard fo r the marketing agreement
cropped out o f a front page story in
a recent edition which said:
“ The poll is the third attempt by
Secretary Wallace to control the Chicago
milk market. Previous attempts
in 1933 and 1934 aroused the ire of
producers, dealers, and consumers
alike. Both times the scheme was j
abandoned by the secretary.
“ The present plan is the result o f
a five day hearing held in Chicago last
June at the request o f the Pure Milk
association which has heen in favor of
federal control milk production.”
Many relatives and friends attended
funeral services fo r Miss Myrtle
Kohasky at St. Williams Catholic
church in Eland last Saturday forenoon.

Another Munich?
One fear long entertained but little

i f that Danzig m ight sim ply and
peacefully declare its union with
Germ any. I f Poland then went to
w ar, she would be labeled as an

been brewing in A dolf H itler’ s mind
ev e r since it becam e apparent that
Germ an force in Danzig would be

idea, for a conflict over Danzig

Com ing up soon is even b igger
script news. In Washington, G eorg
ia ’s Sen. Richard B. Russell Jr.
m ade known a “ certificate plan” he
w ill introduce at the next session o f
congress to solve the fa rm problem .
Its gist:
The secretary of agriculture would
g ive grow ers certificates covering
their allotted portion o f a norm al
dom estic crop. F or exam ple, a cotton
grow er who got 200 pounds from
each of his 10 acres over the previous
five-year average, would get
certificates for that part o f his 2,000
pounds which is ordin arily sold dom
estically. T o purchase this cotton,
domestic buyers must also buy the
certificates, paying fo r them the d ifferential
between the m arket price
and parity price. I f the parity price
w ere 15 cents and cotton sold at 10
cents, certificates would cost five
cents a pound.
B iggest advantage of the plan is
that it lifts the burden of parity
paym ents from governm ent shoulders.
D isadvantages: (1) It is
m erely a disguise for unpopular
processing taxes, and would ultim
ately raise costs to consumers; ( 2)
it still leaves the export problem
unsolved.

C. R evised and extended to July 31,

and advise the agricultural departm
ent how much subsidy they
need to finance the export.

A t that tim e he boasted that
all objectives of the 1937 court reorganization
plan had heen accom plished
despite the p la i’s defeat as
an entity. N ext day he charged conshould
be encouraged by the “ con- I 8 ress’ defeat of his neutrality and
se rva tiv e” trend in congress, but ( lend-spend legislation was leading
that “ further positive action’ ’ w as ' business o ver a precipice. On the
third day he created a sensation
by w arning he would bolt the Demo-
; cratic party in 1940 if the convention
decided on "co n s erva tive . . .
or lip-service candidates’ ' and a
“ straddlebug platform .”
This served to produce 1940 fo re casts
from previously silent sources.
I N eb rask a's Sen. E dw ard R. Burke
I predicted the President would or-
I ganize and lead a new “ lib eral” party.
H e also thanked Mr. Roosevelt
for bringing about such a realignment,
term ing the present labels
“ D em ocrat” and “ Republican” as
“ an offense to the intelligence o f the
electorate.”
Most sensational developm ent,
how ever, cam e from the President’s
own house leader, T e x a s ’ Rep. Sam
| Rayburn. Probably sm elling a party
rift, he w ired this reply to a
query by the Fort Worth Star-Teleg
ram : “ I am for that outstanding
T exan and liberal Dem ocrat, John
N. G arner, for the presidential nomination
in 1940, believing that if
elected he w ill m ake . . . a great
President.”
Meanwhile, North D akota’s Re-
J publican Sen. Gerald N y e saw that
a Roosevelt drift toward super-liberalism
meant that all parties must
I follow suit in modified fashion. Said
he: “ I f thc Republican party is g oing
to get anywhere in 1940 it has
got to m ake up its mind that its
candidate and platform are going to
have to be forward-looking and progressive.
Both will have to . . .
maintain and im prove some of the
advances . . . established under
the N ew D eal.”
Another voice, that of Minnesota’s
F arm er-Laborite Sen. Ernest Lundeen:
“ I f the A. F. of L. and
C. I. O. would get together they
would hold the 1940 election in the
palm of their hand. The farm vote
would swing in and they could
m arch right into the White House.”

W A S H IN G T O N .—It was the farm
revolt against the N ew D eal that
w as responsible for a good m any of
the Republican victories in the 1938
election, and, to a lesser extent, for
the failu re o f the N ew D eal purges
against recalcitra n t D em ocratic senators.
Th i* w as notably true in Ohio,
w here perhaps the turnover as between
the 1936 and the 1938 votes
w as the mo6 t spectacular in the
country. But there was scarcely a
state in which this dissatisfaction of
the fa rm ers with the w a y things
w ere going did not play a part in
the reaction.
What m akes this so im portant
right now is that the fa rm situation
has not m easu rably im proved, and
that there is nothing of im portance
on the horizon which indicates that
it m ay be substantially im proved
before next year. Th e food and
clothing stam ps for surplus com m
odities w ill help a little bit. The
idea seem s to be good, and it is
w orking fa ir ly w ell in experim en tal
areas. Th is m eans that it w ill be
lib e ra lly extended, and m a y prove
v e ry im portant. But fe w keen students
o f the fa rm problem in W ashington
think that it is going to be
enough to change the tide.
W hat can change the tide, of
course, is a v e ry different farm
picture next yea r. Nobody can tell
about that now. but nature m ay
take a hand, either in restricting
crops here, or, even better from
the standpoint o f farm incomes, by
restricting them abroad.
Conditions M ig h t Arise to
Make ff allace President
I f the fa rm ers o f this country next
season should have bum per crops,
w hile the fa rm ers of
| the A rgen tin e and
| other com peting are-
1 as suffer drouth and
pestilence, so that
the fa rm ers o f the
I United States not on-
! ly have a lot to sell,
j but are able to get
good prices for their
crops, the Republi-
I can candidates can
scream their heads
off without getting
anywhere. The farm
rev o lt w ill sim ply disappear.
It m ight even make H en ry A . W alla
ce President!
But the present situation is desperate,
from the W allace standpoint.
The estim ated corn crop is 2,500,-
000.000 bushels, w hich is not only
! bad because it is enormous, but because
this is the third y e a r in succession
that the corn grow ers of
this country have produced m ore
i than they can sell, or at least, as
B. M. Baruch likes to state the same
problem , “ m ore than they can sell
at a profit.”
W a lla c e’ s ever-norm al gran a ry is
taxed to the roof with a 400,000,000-
bushel ca rry-over. In fact no one
knows w hat to do with the corn.
W a llace has sent out a oall fo r $5.-
500,000 worth of steel corn bins in
w hich the com m odity cred it corporation
can store 50,000,000 bushels
along railroads and near elevators.
So it is sm all w onder that the
food and drug adm inistration was
kicked around w'hen it tried to prevent,
by law, continued use o f dextros
without stating on the label
that it w as contained in processed
I foods. The beet and cane sugar
! group in this country i$ pretty
! strong, politically, but not strong
i enough to battle the problem in that
m am m oth corn crop. I f anybody
wants to use corn sugar in food why
I that is fine—it w ill use up a little
| corn.
Legislators Love P ork hnt
11 ant to Do (hen Carving
“ Spend and spend, tax and tax” is
out the window unless Franklin D.
j Roosevelt can get another m andate
next year, thus proving the “ elect
and ele ct” part of the trilo gy attributed
to but denied by H a rry L.
Hopkins. This does not m ean that
congress has turned parsimonious,
despite the spectacular rejection of
the rule to take up the spend-lend
bill, and the shelving of the housing
measure. The legislators still love
their pork, but they w ant to do the
ca rvin g them selves, ond they want
to select the fa vo re d plates to r e c
e iv e the best slices.
A ctually this congress w as pretty
liberal with the people's money. It
appropriated about $12,500,000,000
this yea r, which is hardly cheeseparing
or a step toward balancing
the budget. But— it refused to increase
the present $45,000,000,000
debt lim it, and then refused to get
around it by the spend-lend device.
The two things took different sorts
o f courage, one easy, po litically, if
one leaves out the angle of defying
the White House, and the other much
m ore difficult. Refusal to increase
the debt lim it did not m ake any
group of voters mad. It did not
d eprive any group who wanted a
piece of fed era l pork or even the
g ra v y to go w ith it. It was just a
gesture. Voting to adopt it did not
stop a single appropriation. It Simply
served notice that, a fter the fed era
l debt has been increased about
four m ore billions, w e are going
to stop increasing it.
Appropriation s Exceed
Last Year*t by O ver B illio n
Th is y e a r ’s appropriations, howev
er, w ere roughly $1,100,000,000
m ore than last y e a r ’s, which w ere
11 billion 400 m illions. But the im portant
thing now is to note the
trend. The econom y revolt, if it can
be called that from such an e x travagan
t congress, cam e right at
the end o f the session. Jiust a fter
the house refused even to take up
the spend-lend bill—by voting down
the rule under which it w as to have
been considered— the house appropriations
com m ittee waded into the
final deficiency appropriation bill,
cutting the amounts authorized m ore
s a va g ely than any appropriation bill
has been cut by this body since 1933.
Th is would seem to spell plenty of
econom y next y ea r.
I f business gets better— as the
stock m arket seem ed to predict the
day a fter the house killed the spendlend
bill— it would seem unlikely
that the P residen t can w ork the
country up against the m en who
vo ted to kill the bill.
Which would m ean econom y, plentifu
lly sprinkled with pork.
N ot Even Jim Farley C ould
F ind Out President's Plans
Shortly a fter the Hatch bill becam
e law , enthusiastic G arn er
boosters actually m ade bets, givin g
three to one, that R oosevelt would
not be renominated. Pressed as to
the explanation o f their confidence,
they insisted that they w e re not
sure the Presid en t had decided not
to seek a third term or he would
not have signed the bill.
Th is is fa r from conclusive logic,
as there is strong opinion that for
the President to have vetoed the
H atch bill, and then run, would
h ave given the Republicans a very
useful club with which to belabor
him during the cam paign.
N ot even Jim F a rle y w as able to
find out w hether the President w ill
m ake the race or
not, so* everyth in g
is speculative, but
there is one v e ry curious
elem ent in the
situation, resem bling
slightly the political
effect of the P r e s ident’s
d e fe a t last
y e a r in the “ p u rge”
prim aries.
It w as contended
then by som e ve ry
a s t u t e politicians
that e v ery tim e the
President lost a purge fight he
thereby m ade his own renomination
m ore likely. Th e theory at that
tim e w as that each defeat m ade it
less likely that the President would
be able to fo rc e the delegation from
that state to the next D em ocratic
convention to vote for som e other
N e w Dealer. H ence it m ade it less
likely that any N ew D ealer except
the President could be nominated.
And finally, that this situation would
fo rc e the P residen t to run again i*i
order to ensure that the N ew D eal
policies would be carried on. The
theory included, o f course, the conviction
held at that tim e that a Dem ocratic
convention would not dare
refuse renom ination if the P re sident's
friends w ere fighting fo r it.
B y the sam e token, the Hatch
bill has undoubtedly curtailed the
pow er the Presid en t w ill be able to
cxercise o v er the national convention.
It w ill be possible to beat the
d e v il round the stump, in m any instances,
but e v e r y tim e this is done
a w eak link is inserted in the chain.
M igh t W ork O ut This Way in
T h e N ational Convention /
Im agin e, fo r exam ple, Postm aster
A , who n orm ally, being a political
pow er in his com m unity, would be
a delegate to the national convention
The H atch law prevents this,
so A has his political m an F rid a y
selected as delega te instead. Im m ediately
two possible weaknesses occur
to the line of federal control
which would not exist if A him self
w ere a delegate. F irst, of course,
F rid a y m a y intend to do w hat A
orders when he goes to the convention.
But when he gets in a delegation
caucus— say, for instance, on
the question of w hether that state
delegation w ill stick by R oosevelt
fo r another ballot—F rid a y m ay decide
to run out on A, and on Roosevelt.
O f course there is nothing A
can do about it in tim e to change
the convention results.
Or it m ay be that A wants to
retain the appearance o f loyalty to
R oosevelt, but p riv a tely thinks the
p a rty's chances in his state would
be better with som e other nominee.
Then he m ay tell F rid a y, v e r y confidentially,
that he wants the d e legation
to lea ve R oosevelt at the first
opportunity, and F rid a y m ay obey
him . Then A can protest to the
W hite House that he was betrayed
by that “ in g ra te” F riday.
But w hile R o osevelt’s chances of
controlling the convention are thus
weakened, this is no guarantee that
he w ill not be renominated. I f there
is a surge o f sentiment for him,
just before the convention, which
m ight be m anifested in preferential
presidential prim aries, it is en tirely
conceivable that the convention
would name him.

But it must have been a quarter
o f an hour a fter Clint heard the
garage-door roll back before he saw
a light in the garage. Then he
heard a sta rter grind, and a car
backed out of the g ara g e, its headlights
swinging as it turned.
Clint stood frozen in attention.
T h e car follow ed the d riv e around
the house on this side, the lights for
an instant shining alm ost directly
tow ard w here Clint stood. Then it
w ent on tow ard the road.
So Asa was gone; Clint fe lt a faint
relief. He w ondered w hat had becom
e o f Inspector Tope, and he
hissed a signal, but had no reply.
Then he heard the ca r returning!
H e saw no lights; but he did see,
d im ly, a dark m ovin g bulk as the
c a r rounded the corn er o f the house
yonder. It m oved fast, dangerously
so . . .
H e heard a g rea t crash, a shattering
o f glass, a tinny crum pling
o f m etal—a g rea t crash, then silence.
And then T o p e ’s voice, yonder, in
im perious sum m ons: “ C lint! Quick!
H e r e !”
And a police w histle, shrill and
long.
there w ere long pauses between
them .
M rs. Ta in e did not understand.
"W h a t does he m ean? 0 she protested.
“ W here is R a b ? ’ *
Tope said gen tly; “ R a b ’ s hurt too,
m a ’ am. W e’ ll need the D octor bad.
Quick, you ca ll him a p !”
Understanding, she obeyed him,
she hurried aw ay, and a fter a m om
ent they heard her voice, w ithindoors,
dem anding that Rand yield
to her the telephone.
A sa asked som e hoarse question,
indistinguishable. “ M y neck hu rts,"
he com plained. “ Rab? H e ’s dead?
I tried to m iss him .”
And Tope answ ered him , in slow
stern tones. “ You didn’t hit Rab,
A sa,*’ he said. “ I pulled him away
in time. I pulled him a w ay from
C H A P T E R X IV
A fter that crashing im pact and
T o p e ’s cry, and the shrill blast of
his w histle, silence descended. Clint
took one bound tow ard w here he
guessed Tope to b e ; then he
checked, and turned. June from the
w indow above him spoke softly:
“ Clint, you all rig h t? ”
“ Y ou ’d better com e,” he said
hoarsely. It w as a m atter o f seconds
only, until she stood beside
him. H er fingers caught his.
“ Here, you take th is !” she bade
him, and pressed T o p e ’s old rev o lve
r into his hand.
He saw Tope kneeling beside a
man who lay here on the ground.
T h e flashlight illumined his countenance.
R ab T a in e! His cheek was
sm eared. Blood from a cut on his
head had flowed out over his ear
and trickled down his brow and
face. H e lay lim p and lifeless.
“ D ead?” C lint asked hoarsely.
Tope shook his head. His hand
w as on R a b ’s w rist, feelin g for the
faint pulse that fluttered there. “ N ot
dead y e t,” he said.
June pressed close to Clint, and
she said m isera bly:
“ I t ’s Asa. Oh. w hat is it, Clint?
What happened?”
Clint shook his head, staring at
Asa Taine, who sat here under the
jam m ed wheel o f the car. Asa was
unconscious; and there was something
m ysteriou sly affrigh tin g in his
posture. His hands hung down lim ply
by his sides; and the bent steering-
column pressed the wheel itself
against his body, so that he seem ed
to bulge in the middle. His head
w as in a grotesque and unnatural
position. C ricked to one side, it
rested against the fra m e of the
door. His head was erect, even
tilted backw ard, but his chin
seem ed to be pressed down on his
chest. It w as as though he w ere
frozen in the v e r y act of a hiccough.
Tope said reflective ly , as though
thinking aloud: “ I guess he piled
into that tree faster than he m eant
to. H e must have seen m e, and
that would surprise him. I guess
he lost his head, stepped on it. He
didn’t m ean to hit so hard.”
Rand and another policem an in
uniform cam e panting through the
rain. “ What happened?” Rand
gasped.
Without explanation. Tope said
crisp ly: “ One of you watch the other
house. Rand, you go call Inspector
H eale.' I f he’ s not too sick to
m ove, get him up here.”
Since they flrst discovered Asa
here, Inspector Tope had not left
the m an ’ s side, had kept him fixed
in the flashlight’ s beam. N ow they
saw that his lif>s began to stir and
mumble. Then he blinked. The
light w as in his eyes.
June cried so ftly: “ W e ’ ll g et you
out in a minute, A s a .”
Mrs. Taine cam e running out of
the kitchen door, brushing past
Rand as he entered, draw in g some
w rap around her. She reached the
side o f the car. “ A s a !” she cried,
and caught at his shoulder, tugging
at him.
“ Oh,” he w hispered. It was like
a w histle o f pain. “ M y head. Neck.
Don’ t touch— ”
Mrs. T a in e w hirled on the Inspector.
“ Q uick,” she comm anded.
“ G et him out o f there.” And she
looked all about. “ W here is R a b ? ”
she cried.
Asa m uttered through stiff lip s; his
lips w ere blue.
“ Sorry, M other,” he said, and
tried to sm ile. “ He dodged in front
o f me. I ran right into him. I
couldn’t help it.”
His lips closed and opened again.
“ I couldn’t help it,” he repeated.
“ We both dodged the sam e w a y .”
“ I was going to tow n,” Asa m urmured.
“ But m y headlights went
out as soon as I hit the road.
I cam e back to get a new fuse— ”
His words w ere spaced w id ely ;
the tree, w here you ’d propped him
u p !”
His vo ice had in it the inexorable
ring of doom.
“ H e’s a liv e ? ” A sa asked slow ly,
carefu lly, his mouth twisted.
“ H e’ll com e around,” said Tope.
“ H e’ ll be all right by and by.”
Without any m ovem ent o f his
head, A s a ’s eyes swung to seek out
their countenances. H e peered in
the darkness, and his lips writhed
so that his teeth w ere hideously
bare. Then he m oved. It was as
though he leaped, as though he
would have sprung to action. His
lips set hard; his shoulder rose; his
whole body contorted; one hand
darted down. . . . It whipped up,
and a gun showed in the flashlight’s
gleam . I
Inspector Tope, leaning into the
car, sought to seize the gun.
But before he could touch Asa.
could grasp the weapon, the need
for action passed. When the hurt
man thus leaned sharply forw ard,
his head was tardy in follow ing his
m ovem ent. It seem ed to hang back,
and then to be jerk ed aside as
though by an invisible hand; and
this w as a strange, unnatural thing
to see. A sa ’s head turned at a grotesque
angle, as though it had
slipped; and instantly Asa him self
was sm aller, like a pricked balloon.
And quite still.
Clint w hispered: “ F o r G od’s sake.
Inspector! Is he d ead ?”
Tope nodded slow ly. “ Y es, dead,”
he said, in a low tone.
C H A P T E R X V
F or a m om ent m ore these three
stood silently by the ca r with a dead
man at the wheel. Then Rand returned.
“ H eale’ s com in g,” he reported.
“ R ight a w a y.”
Tope nodded. “ Th is man in the
car is dead,” he said. “ Stay by him.
Don’t touch anything.”
And he turned back to where Rab
lay on the ground. Then Mrs. Taine
cam e running from the house. “ Doctor
C abler w ill be here at once.”
she gasped; and she cried:
“ W here’ s Asa? What have you done
with him ?”
June put her arm s about the older
woman, held her away. “ Rab
needs you now,” she urged. “ Rab,
Aunt E v ie .”
“ A sa ? ” the older woman dem anded.
“ H e ’s dead,” June told her, m ercifully
frank.
“ Who killed h im ?” Th ere was a
dreadful challenge in the slow, soft
tones. “ He w as a live a m oment
ago. Talkin g to m e. Who killed
m y son?”
“ H e—just d ied,” June to’d her.
“ Please. We must take ca re of
Rab now .”
But Mrs. Taine swung toward the
car. Tope with his flashlight bent
on the hurt man on the ground,
heard the m other brooding o ver
Asa, calling his name, pleading with
him —then June com pelling her to
turn this w ay. T h e re 'w a s strength
in the g ir l’s tones; she was able to
comm and Aunt E v ie at last, to fetch
her here w here Tope and Clint knelt
beside the unconscious man.
“ We ll carry R ab to the house.”
said the Inspector. “ Out o f the rain.
Clint, you take his leg s.”
T h ey bore him into the house,
w h ere Tope knelt beside him , and
w ith ca refu l fingers appraised his
hurts. Mrs. T a in e stood still as ice,
w atching, and June held her fast.
Tope looked up at last. “ Just a
bump on the head, m a ’ a m ,” he told
M rs. Taine. “ I ca n ’t fe e l that the
skull’s broken.”
M rs. Ta in e began suddenly to c r y ;
and this w as a strange thing to see
in that w om an o f iron.
June said: “ I ’ll m ake her lie
down.” She led Mrs. Taine, submissive,
away.
When they w ere gone, Clint knelt
by the Inspector’s side, asked the
question he had not dared ask before.
He nodded toward the d o o r,
tow ard Asa outside in the rain.
“ You think he—did it ? ” he whispered.
Tope assented gravely.
“ But I liked him ,” Clint protested.
“ He w as the best o f them a l!!”
Th e doorbell ran g; Clint went
through the dark hall; lighted the
gas, opened the door. D octor Cabler.
Clint cam e back with the physician
on his heels; and Doctor Cabler,
with no m ore than a nod tow
ard the Inspector, knelt beside the
m an on the floor.
Presen tly he finished, tipped back
on his heels. “ Concussion,” he said.
“ I shall m ake a spinal puncture, try
to relieve the pressure on his brain.
O therw ise the young m an m ay die
without recoverin g consciousness.”
And he d irected : “ H elp me. Push
those two tables together. Put w ater
on to boil. W here’ s Mrs. T a in e ? ”
“ In the front room ,” said Tope.
“ With June.” And he explained:
“ A s a ’s dead, in the car, outside.
H e ran into that pine tree. Neck
broken, I believe. A liv e at first.
Talked, then he tried to m ove, his
head twisted to one side, and that
w as the end of him .”
“ W ell, such things have happened,”
the Doctor confessed, after
a mom ent. “ Some shock dislocates
the verteb rae without dislodging
them. Then a m ovem ent, an attem
pt to turn the head, and the big
neck m uscles drag one vertebra
across the other like a pair of
shears. Snip the co rd .”
Doctor C abler and Mrs. Taine,
Clint and June could do all that was
needful here. Tope w atched them
fo r a m om ent; then he went to the
telephone, called M iss Moss and
told her guardedly that R ab was
hurt and Asa dead.
She w hispered: “ Asa d ead ?”
“ Y e s ,” he said.
“ Is his w ife th ere?” M ies Moss
asked. “ L iss a ? ” And at T o p e’s nega
tive: “ She would want to be. She
has a right to be. I ’ m com ing out.
I ’ ll bring h er.”
He was full o f a deep com fort to
know that she would com e. “ A ll
righ t,” he assented. “ D o.”
He looked at his w atch and returned
to the veranda. A s he did
so, Inspector H eale cam e hurriedly
across the lawn from the road.
H eale excla im ed ; “ Tope, w hat’s
happened h ere? ”
Tope said slow ly: “ R a b ’s hurt—
got a bad crack on the head. Doctor
C ab ler’s w orking on him .” He
added: “ And A sa ’s out in the car
with a broken neck.”
“ Broken neck?” H eale echoed.
His voice w'as husky. “ Is he d ead ?”
“ Just as dead as if he’d been
hanged,” Tope assented. He said
it with something like contentment
in his tones, as though he perceived
a seem liness and order in the w orld:
“ Th ey don’t hang in this State any
m ore; but I alw ays said it was the
thing—fo r m urderers. I m ean.”
H eale ejacu lated: “ M u rderers?”
And Tope told him b riefly: “ Y es.
He and Rab had an argum ent tonight,
in the garage. He hit Rab
w ith a m onkey-wrench, propped
him against that pine tree by the
corner of the d rive, got out his car.
He drove to the road and turned
around and cam e back again. He
m eant to run into Kab, finish him.
“ But I was there. Before Asa got
back, I ’d dra gged Rab away from
the tree. Asa saw me. Seeing m e
must have startled him so that he
stepped on the gas. Anyw ay, he
ram m ed into the tree so hard it
snapped his ow n neck.”
H eale stood in an incredulous
am azem ent, and Tope concluded:
“ D idn’t kill him right off. H e cam e
to. He thought he’d hit Rab, and
he told us it w as an accident, that
Rab dodged in front o f the car.
When I told him he hadn’t hit Rab,
that Rab w as a live, he went for his
gun.
“ But when he moved, his neck
snapped. Finished h im !”
H eale w as almost wordless.
“ Gun?” he repeated.
“ H ere it is,” said Tope, and delive
red A sa ’s weapon to the other
man.
Then D octor Cabler cam e out to
them . “ G en tlem en ," he said, satisfaction
in his tones, “ Rab is showing
signs o f returning consciousness.”
“ H e’ll liv e ? ” Tope asked.
“ Oh, that, certain ly,” the physician
confidently agreed. “ And I
think by m orning he m ay be able to
talk to you.”
H e went back into the house; and
H eale roused from his paralysis of
surprise. “ Y ou think Asa did the
rest of it? ” he asked.
“ I ’ ve known that, since this m ornin
g,” Tope replied.
“ Why didn’t you tip m e? ”
“ Know ing isn’ t proving,” Tope rem
inded him ; and Heale ruefully assented.
“ I guess I ’ ll call D errie,” he decided
at last. “ H ave him up here
in the m o rn in g !” And he confessed
a little gru d gin gly: “ Y ou ’ve made
a doubiC-barreled fool out of him.

B efore she dressed, she telephoned
fo r a taxicab ; and when she
cam e out it was at the door.
“ Th e Provid en ce road.” she directed.
“ I ’ll tell you when to stop.”
When she rang the doorbell of

w as fa r into the sm all hours; the
rain still sheeted down.
A window opened above her head,
and T h ayer called a question.
“ I must speak to Miss Th ayer,”
M iss Moss explained.
The g a ra g e man h im self cam e to

Night of the Big W in d Dated Live* of Irish
M any A m ericans whose grandparents
w ere born in Ireland have
heard these elders speak of the
night o f the big wind. As some of
the ancestors referred to it as the
date o f their birth the youngsters
m ay have regarded it as a bit of
frivolou s avoidance of fact. But
there was such a night, recalls the
N ew Y o rk Sun.
It began about 11 o ’clock on the
night o f January 6, 1839, and continued
until after d a yligh t the next
m orning. L im erick and the Dublin
neighborhood suffered heavily. T w o
hundred houses w ere blown down
and as m any m ore w ere burned.
T w en ty persons w ere killed in these
catastrophes and 100 w ere drowned.
Th e coasts o f Ireland and western
England w ere lined with wrecks.
As Ireland did not keep vita l statistics
until 1860, the night o f the
big wind was used as the base of
many claim s m ade under the oldage
pension act 30 yea rs ago. The
Irish D igest reprints some paragraphs
from “ Things Past R e dress,”
a book by Augustine B irrell,
who went to Ireland as ch ief secretary
in 1907:
“ It was a wonderful w ind! Dickens
alone could have done it justice.
It ought to have blown itself out
in 1839, but there it still was, w eeping
pension officers and local g o vernm
ent officials off their feet in
1908. Question any old m an as to
his claim , and you learned that his
age had gone astray on him, but he
w as a fine, hardy lad on the night
o f the big w in d !”
As news distribution, like the collection
of vital statistics, w as in its

Climbing Kangaroos
M em bers of the A m erican Museum

to Dutch N ew Guinea have discovered
11 specimens of tree-clim bing
kangaroos. They are five to six
feet over-all length and com e from
the slopes of the C yclop mountains,
just behind Hollandia. These rare
kangaroos clim b like the natives
reaching up with their front paws,
then hoisting them selves as the rear
paws follow.

TRUTH about ADVERTISING

“ Com e with m e,”

I followed.
He took m e behind the counters.
He pointed out neatly printed white
cards pasted up at close intervals
throughout the store, w here the
clerks couldn’t help seeing.
I read what they said.
“ H E R E COM ES T H E Q U E E N !”
“ It’s our slogan,” the executive

Sessions Records
Wisconsin’s legislature is one of the
two state legislatures in the country
‘still in session. The NVw Jersey legislature
is nearing its close, winding lip
its affairs with the settlement o f its
re,;*'f problem.
The present Wisconsin session is j
within six weeks o f breaking thej
state’s record session o f 1935,
adiourned sine die Sentember 27. The
1939 session opened January 11.
There is considerable debate as to
when legislators will go home. Most
observers bclievp that if the tax bill is
enacted this week that the session end
will be near.
THE QUEEN I*
I happen to know that this policy
has paid handsome dividends to the
store. As I think it over, however,
only in form and expression is that
policy dilferent from that of every
other organization which advertises
fo r your trade. A ll have to treat you
as though you w ere the queen—or
the king.
Anyone who has been buying
much in the stores w ill tell you that
the treatm ent received from clerks
is vastly different from w hat it was
years ago. Th ey are m ore considerate.
They are better informed.
The reason for this change is that
they have the ideal which advertising
has created in their minds, and
to this ideal they must conform.
A ll over the country, in every
newspaper, advertisers are vyin g
with one another in telling the story
o f their products and in im proving
their products to make them more
acceptable.
Their desire is to produce something
fit for the queen—o r the king—
and their advertising sets up a
standard to which they must strive.
In the process you get the best
products and service it is possible
to provide.

by the time the mistake was discovered,
it was too late to do anything about
it.
Scabiosa, fo r instance, is obviously
a disease. I f you were to come across
the word without having seen it before,
there would be no doubt about it.
Just as obviously Acne Rosacea is the
name of a flower, and an exceptionally
beautiful and hardy flower, at
that. Take our old friend. Halitosis
that has blighted so many lives and
been responsible for so many permanent
bridesmaids. It is as clear as
anything can be that when the name
was invented, it was meant to be
eiven to a graceful, climbing shrub.
On the other hand. Salpijflossis, before
the lists got mixed, was a slow,
lingering malady, the kind that people
are always being cured o f by Chinese!
herb doctors. Primula is a flow er and |
Scrofula isn’t, but not by any process
o f logic.
To the superficial reader, there!
would seem to be nothing wrong in an j
account c f somebody’s dying of;
coreopsis and asking, as his last re-!
que-it. that nothing but neuralgia be!
planted on his grave. It is always a
which) shock to find that gypsophila. which
scunds delightfully psychopathic, is j
vulgarly but poetically baby’s breath j
and a treasure o f old-fashioned g a rdens.
“ Once I knew a doctor who was a
zealous horticulturist, and he admitted

W ittenberg Defeats Fdcar
The Pilots squared their account
with Edgar Sunday by trouncing them
21 to 12, in a game which had about
evervthint* that could be crowded into
a eame o f baseball.
Wolff, first man to face Fisher,
drove a home run into centerfield to
tallv the first Pilot run. E dgar came
hack in th «ir half o f the first to take
the lead with two runs. This lead did
not last long— W ittenberg came hack
in the second with a barrage of hits,
including a home run by Arnold, and
when the side finally was retired the
Pilots had scored eight runs. Palladeau
nitched some nice ball from the
second to the ninth inning and should
have held Edgar scoreless but for
some errors by his team mates. The
fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh, saw
Fisher hurling some nice ball. The
ninth was played in a downpour o f
rain and saw both pitchers gettin g a
thorough lambasting. In this inning
Arnold connected fo r his second home
run, one o f the longest ever to be hit
on the Edgar diamond. H. Drumm
and Rasmusson duplicated fo r Edgar
in their half. Fierke pitched to one
man, Werner, in the ninth and set him
down on three pitched strikes to end
this hectic inning.
A line drive stab by Pukall of
Fleece’s hard hit ball, Arnold’s onehanded
catch o f Buehler's line drive,
and two running catches by Hoffman,
Edgar left fielder, were features of
the game.
Schoepke, W ittenberg catcher, was
spiked two times and had to leave the
game in the fourth. Derrow finished
the game back o f the plate fo r the
Pilots. H. Drumm received a badly
sprained ankle in the ninth, sliding
into second and had to be helped off
the field.
The Pilots need only one win to nab
the pennant and w ill try and add Kelly
to their list o f victims next Sunday.
This game w ill be played at K elly and
w ill start at 2:30.

I'v e long believed that one reason
the art o f canning and preserving
has been neglected is that many o f j
us have forgotten just how good

be. W e 've forgotten the teasing tang
o f pickling spices, the m ellow aroma
o f rich fruit butters that used to
m ake the a ir fragran t at canning
tim e. M aybe w e need only to be

E A L L rea lize that the child
who is shy and constantly em barrassed
by bashfulness has a
handicap that needs ve ry w ise handling.
Many tim es a parent can
help a child to rise above this tim idity
and becom e happily sociable,
delighting in personal contacts.
“ June started out to be one of
those little children who hide beind
their m other’ s skirts at the approach
of a stran ger; her lips quivered
if she w ere singled out for attention
and she evaded the m ailm an
and the m ilkm an when they cam e
on their d a ily rounds,” related a
mother before a group o f parent
students. “ I determ ined that she
should never hear any o f the fam ily
comm ent on her shyness. I also
made up m y mind to think of w ays
o f helping the baby to overcom e this
handicap. I knew I should have to
go v e ry carefu lly along the w ay or
I m ight m ake m atters worse, but
today June is such an unusually r e sponsive
child and m eets people so
easily that I feel m y ca refu lly laid
plans w ere w ell w orth while.
“ I began with the m ailm an as he
cam e each day. I allowed June to
stick the stam p on m y letter. This
seem ed such a big thing to her!
Then, with the letter in her hand
to g ive the m ailm an, she forgot her
fear and ran out to m eet him. He
helped me by not getting too friendly
with her all at once. And in much
this sam e sim ple w ay I acquainted
June with the m ilkm an and the
grocery boy. I let her put the tickets
in the m ilk bottles and let her
set the bottles out. Th at g a v e her
an interest in the man who delivered
the m ilk. I would em p ty the
grocery boy’ s basket and hand her
the em pty container to g iv e to him.

“ When guests cam e to the house I
would ask her to open the door. She
soon learned to ask them to be seated
especially if their m anner when
they greeted her w as not too fa m iliar.
Most little boys and girls like to
get acquainted with a strange person
gradually, but m any older people
are apt to gush o v er children,
the m oment they m eet them. When
June started fo r nursery school she
was somewhat afraid of the ex p erience.
But each m orning I let her
take some sm all g ift to the teacher
and her jo y in ca rryin g the flow er

solved happily.
“ Shyness or backwardness is often
regarded by parents as a trait the
child w ill outgrow and so they fe el it
need not be g iven special concern.
I like to think that in our hom e we
are alw ays helping the children to
develop the traits that w ill benefit
them. Th ey should be able to m eet
people happily, be sufficiently selfpossessed
to enter into child a ctivities
and reap the jo y o f personal

within them selves that they
are capable of joining in a conversation

playing gam es with as much vim

“ Shyness induces an inferiority

Cottons Take on Importance
In ‘ Back-to-School’ Wardrobe
B y C H E R I E N I C H O L A S
TODAY’S
HEALTH
COLUMN
i
I Cu lions are gaining in biyic prcsuge.
T h ey are the m ore persuasive in
that they are such grand and glo-
| rious washable successes, added to
which they are durable as w ell as
sm art.
Tru e aristocrats among the newer
fabrics are the fine shantung cottons
and the highly m ercerized poplins,
both of which actually seem to
im prove with repeated launderings,
for the iron brings out the native
luster o f the cotton.
F a ll prints are m ore subdued. The
backgrounds are darker. N o wise
m other chooses any print these days
that is less than perfectly washable,
com pletely color-fast and sanforized
shrunk.
F o r dress-up, little girls w ill w ear
stunning cloque piques, fine linens,
washable spun rayons and new
crashes that resem ble linens but are
actually serviceable cotton.
Another outstanding fa vo rite is
w ashable gabardine for school and
fo r all autumn activities. Blouses,
shorts, skirts, culottes, in fa c t e v ery
conceivable type of garm en t for
youthful wearers of both sexes who
lead a strenuous outdoor life are
showing in cotton gabardines that
are processed so they cannot shrink
out of fit.
i Destined to be a schoolgirl fa vorite
is the cunning dress pictured
to the left at the top in the group.
A s much like m other’ s bolero ja ck et
outfit as possible is this modish
frock designed so c le ve rly fo r little
daughter with whom it is most
certain to prove first choice to w ear
I “ flrst day of school." M ade o f flne
quality shantung broadcloth guaranteed
pre-shrunk o f course, this m ode
l is m ost attractive. The bolero
com es off and leaves a sm art little
short-sleeved frock. Worn with a
new fa ll felt, the outfit m akes a chic
ju nior ensem ble to snuggle under a
good w arm coat when cool w eather
sets in.
An ideal tubster is the cunning
dress worn by the youngster seated
in the foreground. It is m ade of a
m odern safe-for-washing print, the
excellen t shantung cotton print that
m others know and approve for backto-
school w ardrobes. N ote the dainty
hand-fagotting in the collar and
please observe that a generous shirring
g ive s plenty o f front and back
fullness. The pockets are cle ve r and
new.
The sm iling young bicyclist on the
right w ears a very intriguing frock
styled o f a striped cotton print
that is alm ost as sturdy a w ea ve as
could be found in any collection of
m aterials, added to which is its attractiveness.
Th e skirt is pleated
and a gypsy sash of the m aterial
ties at the waist.
Th e teen-age who possess almost
an uncanny s t jle sense are having
grea t fun ensembling gabardine outfits
that m ake color their theme. A
m arine blue gabardine skirt, a y ellow
blouse, a m agenta kid belt, a
y ellow jacket, a bright headkerchief
square that has peasant figurines
dancing around the w ide border
goes to the color lim it and y et how
effe ctive it is and best of all dependably
washable.
In choosing the new bright cottons
w e can’ t urge mothers too strongly
to stop, look and be cautious before
they buy. Look at the label whether
it be an all-ready-to-w ear garm en t
you are selecting for Junior or little
sister or a washable fabric by the
yard. Look for service guarantees
o f non-shrinkage and no-fade on the
fabrics.

Cold Shower
May Do Harm
To Individual
B y D R. J A M E S W. B A R T O N
IT IS hard to understand
how the idea started that
a cold tub or shower bath
the first thing in the morning
was good for the
health, hardened
up the body and
warded off disease.
A s a m a t t e r
of fact, the m orning cold bath
does much harm to a great
many, not because there is
anything wrong with a cold
shower and a brisk rub first thing
in the m orning fo r a strong, hardy
individual, but because the a vera g e
individual is not strong and hardy.
Th e reason so m any feel that
despite the discom fort and shock
the m orning cold tub or shower bath
is helpful is that a fter the bath and
rub there is a “ bracing” reaction
fo r a short time. H ow ever, one or
two hours afterwards
there is a
| ^ feelin g of tiredness
^ l a n d depression
| which they do not
know is due to the
E f ? I W hy is the m om -
m ing cold shower a
J ll m^sta^e f°r so
When w e awake
A the body is rea lly at
Dr. Barton its low est point o f
resistance due for
the most part to the need of food or
fuel. The tem perature is low, the
blood pressure low, the heart beat
slow and not as strong as at any
other tim e. T o m ake the body, in
this low condition, undergo the
“ shock” o f a cold bath is like licking
a person when he is down.
One in Four H ave Resistance.
H ow ever, there is the individual
(about one in fou r) who, because of
inborn or acquired resistance, can
take this cold bath, have a brisk
rub, feel a good reaction without
any “ let down” during the day.
An idea used by m any who wish
to get the refreshing reaction to the
cold w ater without too much shock
to the system is to run a few inches
of hot w ater into the bathtub, stand
in it for a minute to let the he i t
of the w ater strike the la rge blood
vessels o f the ankles and then step
into the cold w ater shower. The
heat o f the w ater, by adding
w arm th to the blood and a little
m ore speed to the circulation, prevents
the severe shock of the cold
w ater. A brisk rubdown stimulates
the circulation and the benefit o f the
m orning cold shower is felt all day.
Those who are thin, have thin
blood, or a poor circulation would
do w ell to avoid cold showers or tub
baths unless prescribed by their
physician.

Indian Clan
The sachem w as a functionary of
an Indian clan— a comm on division
of the Indian tribe. The clan had
two distinct kinds of leaders, a
sachem and a chief. The sachem
was judge and adm inistrator o f ancient
customs and his functions
w ere those of peace time. He was
chosen by the adult m em bers of
the clan and his election usually
depended upon the influence o f his
im m ediate fam ily in the clan group.
The chief, on the contrary, won his
title by individual prowess. He
was chosen because of some special
deed or because of some outstanding
trait. Th e ch ief was the war
tim e leader. In current thought the
term sachem applies to the principal
dignitaries of Tam m any Hall
—the N ew Y ork political organ ization.
The Society o f St. Tam m any,
the nam e under which Tam m any
H all was incorporated, takes its
nam e from the Indian who is patron
saint o f the organization.
Span o f T in ie„
Prob ab ly the greatest tim e span
between two im portant cities is that
between N ew Y ork and Hongkong.
A t 12 noon in N ew Y ork it is 37
minutes past m idnight in Hongkong.
H ere is a charm ing interpretation
of the “ little dinner” suit. It contrasts
a form al floor-length skirt
with a wee jacket blouse. Th e fabric
that fashions this attractive dinner
dress is tecla tw ill, a crim ped
spun acetate rayon w eave that looks
like sheer suedelike wool and feels
like duvetyn. The modish jacket
that buttons around the waist accenting
a deep V-neckline is in dusty
pink. The skirt, in an Indian wine
shade, is styled with a front fullness
that lends its sculptural grace.

I t ’s going to prove a record season
for suede. Pa ris cables say
“ suede” with emphasis, citing accessory
ensem bles of hat, bag, belt and
gloves done in richly colorful
suede. Som e suede enthusiasts are
dressing in suede from head to
foot. The new suede processing is
so am azing, the results are a lightness
and softness that yields perfe
ctly to fabric treatm ents. In consequence
high-fashion wom en are
taking to w earing stunning dresses

type of sw eater in any color, keyed
to any occasion from the m ost form

Sw eaters, ev er the schoolgirls’

devices, such as the names o f leading
colleges scribbled in gay print

It has been thought and taught
that exercise was harmful to the
kidneys owing to the great amount
of w astes resulting from exercise
which the kidneys would have to
rem ove from the blood. Evidences
o f too much work being put on the
kidneys are (a ) too many red blood
corpuscles and (b ) too m any
“ casts” (little casts or molds of solid
m atter in the shape o f kidney
tubes) in the urine.
Dr. A. N aeraa in the Scandinavian
M edical Journal, Stockholm,
states that as a certain number o f
red blood corpuscles and hyaline
casts (little plugs of proteid m ateria
l) are found in the urine o f norm
al individuals, there is great interest
in the various amounts of these
cells and casts. The question arises
whether physical exertion produces
on increase in the number o f red
blood corpuscles and casts norm ally
present in the urine and whether
other kinds o f casts besides the hyaline
m ay appear under the sam e
conditions. In order to learn ex actly
what happens when exercise is
taken, Dr. N aeraa m ade sediment
counts on 35 specimens of urine
from 12 men who took part in a sixday
bicycle race in 1934.
Sediment Study Made.
Dr. N aeraa states that his studies
on the sedim ent o f the urine o f these
men who had indulged in this seve
re exercise for six days showed
no signs of any failu re or breaking
down of the kidneys, as there was
no increase in the blood corpuscles
' or hyaline casts.
The belief that exercise, by creat-
• ing wastes, would swam p the kidj
neys with work as they rem oved
I these wastes from the blood is uni
founded, according to Dr. N aeraa s
findings.
It is o f course true that when the
heart begins to fail there is considerable
congestion o f the kidneys. It
is likew ise true that severe exercise
1 w ill put too much work on a failing
heart. Thus exercise in one with a
I failing heart, because o f congestion
and dam age already present in the
kidneys, m ight readily cause further I
i dam age.
H ow ever, the a vera ge individual
! need not fear that exercise is going j
to dam age his kidneys because of
extra wastes manufactured by the
i exercise

“ W e w ere a hundred yards astern of the Pensacola, when suddenly
our m otor q u it."
those four lads worked frantically, trying to get the m otor started again,
but they only m ade m atters worse. They ran the batter down and
then they w ere left without lights.
T h e G ig D r ift s S lo w ly O u t to S e a .
“ By this tim e ," says Floyd, “ it was pitch dark and it had started to
rain. Th ere w as nothing to do but drift, so we d rifte d ."
And under that casual statement, there lies a world of terror.
Those four lads—every one of them —knew what it meant to
d rift out to sea. If thev were lucky they m ight be picked up by
a passing steam er. Hut on the other hand. H was all too easy
to drift unsighted for days on end. and finally perish of thirst and
exposure.
“ W e drifted until about 2 a m .," Floyd says, "an d then the sea began
to get rough and w e really had something to w orry about, for there w ere
m ine fields all about the entrance of the harbor and w e figured w e had
drifted into them . The mines w ere moored 12 feet below the surface,
but with the high swells bobbing us up and down, we stood a good chance
o f hitting one of them. W e began holding our breaths .”
About an hour later, they sighted a blinker light— and that was the
signal for m ore panic.
“ I t was too high tn be on a ship,” says F loyd, “ so it must have
been o n a cliff. W ere we going to be washed against this cliff?
W e all prepared for the worst. We put on life preservers and let
out the anchor. Rut the anrhor didn't hold. The boat still drifted.
A fter a w hile w e had drifted to a place w here we could see
lights in the distance. Could it be true that w e w ere in the
channel, heading back toward B rest?”
B o a t D r ift s B a c k to S t a r t in g P o in t .
And that’ s just where they w ere. The boat had drifted right back
to where it had started.
Luck? Sure, it was. But those lads still had the worst of their adventure
to go through. Back on shore, someone had spotted them. The
blinker on the clifT was signaling, but in a code they couldn’ t understand.
“ Woald they open fire on us?” says Floyd. “ Th at’s what we
w ere afraid of. They kept searchlights on us until we w ere half
w av through the channel, and then we saw a sw ift-m oving vessel
coming in our direction. When it got with a hundred >ards of
us I could see that it was a torpedo boat. Its searchlight beamed
on us, and it cam e straight for u s."
Straight at them it cam e—full speed ahead, and with no intention of
Stopping. It just grazed the stern of the boat—but with a force that spun
it around and alm ost knocked its four occupants overboard.
“ By the tim e we had come lo our senses,” says Floyd, " i t
had turned'and was coming back to take another ram at os. All
four of us began yelling at the top of our lungs, 'A m erican s—
A m e ric a n s !’ ”
The boat cam e on. It came within a few feet of the gig. and
then, suddenly, it turned sharply aside. The boys kept right on
yellin g. “ A m e rica n s," then from the French torpedo boat came
the answer, “ Oui, oui.”
“ W e told them our engine had broken dow n," says Floyd, “ and they
said they thought w e w ere a German submarine. Th ey towed us back
to our station, and when we w ere ashore again w e all agreed it was one
night w e would long rem em b er."

Sensation Here.
Men and women from far and near
are flocking daily to their druggist
to get W illiam s Formula,the famous
medicine which is attracting w idespread
attention. People .suffering
from acid indigestion, stomach gas,
sick-headaches, nervousness, dizziness,
“ half-alive” feelin g because o f excess
acidity and lazy elimination declare
they car. hardly believe the rem arkable
relief they have experienced from
taking W illiam s Formula. Floods o f
letters have been pouring in from
gratefu l users, praising this rem arkable
medicine.
Typical o f these letters is the
statement o f Mr. Wm. L. Evans,
widely-known property owner o f
Fond du Lac, Wis., who says:
“ I have experienced considerable
sour gas pains and constipation. Many
foods I would eat would sour and
form a great deal o f gas and I would
bloat. I have also been troubled with
la zy bowels. Some time ago, I decided
to try W illiam s Formula, and I can
surely say that I can eat many fiods
now and W illiam s Formula has a d e finite
stimulant action on my bowels.”
I f you are suffering spells o f d izziness,
sick headaches, nausea, poor appetite,
gas, bloat, tired, run-down,
