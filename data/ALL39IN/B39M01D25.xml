Sales   Service by Representative H E Kaun Hancock Hardware Co Complete service on Singer and other makes pd IN COM E T A X IN FO R M ATIO N During the past week approximately 22000 Wisconsin income  tax blanks were mailed out  from the office of the Assessor of Incomes at Eau Claire Wis to individuals residing in the counties of Barron Buffalo Chippewa Dunn Eau Claire Jackson Pepin Pierce Polk St Croix and Trempealeau Special attention is called to the filing requirements under the Wisconsin income tax law  1 Every person to whom a blank is sent regardless of the amount of his income 2 Every single person having an income of more than $800 even theugh no blank is sent to him 3 Every married couple having an income of $1600 or more even though no blank is sent to them 4 Every partnership even though no blank is sent to it 5 Every person acting in a fiduciary capacity Those persons who do not come under the above requirements need not ask for a blank However persons required to file and who do not or file later than March 15 will be assessed the late filing fee of $5 in addition to any taxes due New taxpayers who have come under the filing requirements for the first time must bear in mind that the office of the Assessor of Incomes has no way of putting these people on the mailing list until after the first blank is received These persons therefore must request a blank from the office of the Assessor Incomes at Eau Claire Early requests received thus far this year indicate there will be many new taxpayers whose incomes have increased sufficiently to require them to file for the first time The Wisconsin income tax blank for 1938 has been changed considerably from the 1937 blanks A new simplified form has been provided for those persons whose income consists of salaries wages interest or dividends only The new simplified form cannot be used if the taxpayer has any other type of income The regular form must be used by these other taxpayers The assessor s office has endeavored to send short forms to all those people on the mailing list who can use the short form If a taxpayer receiving this new form finds however that he requires the regular form as used in past years he should request it from the Assessor of Income Eau Claire Wis As in the past payment is to be made with the filing of the return The taxpayer must compute the tax himself and send his remittance along with the completed return Taxpayers are urged to file the return as soon as possible thereby making sure of being on time and also avoiding the late rush Persons having questions to ask relative to the filing of the return should get the questions in early so that proper attention can be given them  likewise requests for blanks should be made early so that filing can be completed on time The assessor s office will appreciate the cooperation of the taxpayers in these matters BREAD IS YOUR BEST FOODEAT PLENTY OF IT IS MADE OF THE FINEST INGREDIENTS MONEY CAN BUY A SK

to bring about occupancy of the now vacant Indian school property was expressed this week in a letter received by L W Kenny editor of the weekly newspapr here from Congressman Merlin Hull in Washington D C   For years I have endeavored to awaken interest in the matter (of the Tomah Indian school)  he wrote   and you may recollect that I once addressed the Tomah Rotary club urging that it get busy in making the fight I have constantly urged the matter here and shall continue to do so The Federal Indian Office was very unwise in closing that fine plant The school did a great work for the young people as well as for the older folks and it should be reopened at the earliest possible moment I wish that the counties having Winnebago population would also get busy in demanding its reopening You man count on my doing anything in my power to assist  Advocates of the school s being reopened point out that not only will there be considerable loss through deterioration if the property continues in this state of vacancy but another loss representing in rentals and building expenses maintained elsewhere may be figured in thousands of dollars annually Tax reductions may be one of the benefits to be derived from reclaiming the Indian school supporters of the movement claim  La Crosse Tribune Travelei H  Kleven   133 207 208 548 H  Cole  190 117 201 S08 A  H aralson  146

For more than a third of a century farmers farm leaders and members of farm organizations have met annually at the College of Agriculture Madison to discuss and to hear discussed vital questions affecting the future welfare of farmers in Wisconsin This annual event will be held during the week of January 30th to February 3rd Interesting programs have been set up for each day to give those attending an opportunity to attend the program which he or she thinks would be the most interesting Appearing on the various programs we find the names of farmers livestock breeders homemakers representatives of various Agricultural colleges members of the Department of Agriculture and Markets and speakers of the U S Department of Agriculture Washington I will be glad to forward a complete program to any one interested in attending Farm and Home Week Soil Program Many inquiries are being made each day as to when certain 1938 soil program application for payment forms and checks will arrive The checks given out during the past few days represent the application for payment forms which were signed on or about December 15th Checks covering the payments on the application for payment forms which were signed on Dec 27 and 28 should arrive soon The last regular transmittal of approximately 500 application for payment forms were signed last week These checks should arrive before March 1st A few application for payment forms and checks may be delayed because of errors in making up the forms or errors in the signatures Commercial Fertilizers Wisconsin farmers will have fewer formulas to keep in mind when they buy commercial fertilizers in the future A reduction in the number of grades of commercial fertilizer to be offered for sale to farmers of Wisconsin and other midwestern states was made possible through a conference of agronomists and manufacturers of fertilizers representing the Middle West held at Chicago Although as many as 43 different fertilizer mixtures have been offered for sale in Wisconsin agronomists and soils authorities agree that 12 grades of mixed fertilizers are sufficient to meet all crope and soil conditions For Wisconsin the 12 grades of fertilizers suggested include  020 1 0   02020 01212  01020  0927  2126  3189  4164  4106 31212  3918  and 1064 In addition to these manufacturers will offer for sale all the unmixed materials such as 20 per cent and 45 per cent superphosphates 50 per cent muriate of potash and various carriers of nitrogen Wisconsin authorities suggest that there is an advantage in farmers purchasing the higher analysis mixtures since they can be delivered at a lower unit cost than those of lower analyses They explain for instance that a ton of 3189 fertilizer carries exactly the same amount of plant food as one and onehalf tons of 2126 fertilizer In making high grade formulaes the manufacturer uses materials of higher analysis and less filler they point out The additional cost of bags filler labor freight and handling of the lower grade fertilizers are given as the reasons why high grade fertilizers are cheaper per unit than the lower grades NOTICE The annual meeting of the Taylor Creamery Association will be held at Van Gorden s hall in Taylor on Saturday Feb 4th 1939 at 2 o clock p m for the election of officers and the transaction of such other business as may

much difficulty in selecting the various committies and the final selection was not announced until yesterday The usual number of bills and resolutions are being introduced daily but all bills and resolution   except resolutions that are privileged or receive unanimous consent  must first have committee hearings As the committees are getting a late start it is evident that little or no legislation will be enacted during next week Judging from the bills already introduced much consideration will be given to old age assistance automobile and trucks and highway legislation The daily papers will give their version on proposed legislation but interested individuals boards welfare organizations or schools can get exact copies of any proposed legislation by writing to their assemblyman or state senator at the Capitol Building Madison Wis I particularly invite schools to ask for any information they may be interested in A copy of the daily proceedings of the legislature would be of interest to many schools as it shows the entire proceedings of one day s work of the legislature including the roll call of all members on measures considered on that day PETER A HEMMY

masked ball will be given at the   high school auditorium and there will be dancing throughout the evei ning to the music of a sevenpiece band Prizes will be given the best dressed couples Half of the proceeds of the party will be kept in the county to carry on local work The other half will be sent to headquarters to promote the fight against infantile paralysis Already two young people from this county have been given valuable assistance More will be done with what may be kept here this year Tickets are 50 cents and 25 cents The   March of Dimes  is still on Drop a dime in one of the many receptacles to be found in business places around town if you are interested in the work The following is the county committee in charge of the party for Saturday Edward Heineck and Joseph Dvorak Black River Falls  H Bartholomew Merrillan  Louis Epstein Millston  Clayton McCallum Melrose  Charles Dunn Taylor  Robert Fink Hixton  Leonard Emerson Alma Center With this start plus $533 millions for national defense and more millions in prospective demand for the same purpose added to the billions heretofore authorized for war preparations were WPA to be abolished entirely the budget would be sufficiently plethoric for years to come But war or no war or preparations for either there are sufficent demands for money to intensify the search for new forms of taxes Before the week ends a few new buildings for Washington will be authorized   for business reasons  as is always explained The 1940 census taking will need $50 millions for 7000 em ployees in Washington and ten times as many in the field There may be some little machine politics in their selection at that as political organizations are not likely to overlook a bet like that in a presidential campaign year A new census building is in the cards to house the census employees at a cost of $5000000 as the present Commerce building erected at a cost of $17 millions in a previous administration denounced for extravagance has become too crowded to accommodate the Census Bureau A dozen other new buildings are in prospect and the Jefferson Memorial is underway Economy will have to start in other places than in WPA if there is a move made toward balancing the budget There is wide interest in the president s program for expanding the air forces of both army and navy At present the army has 2300 planes and the navy about 3000 The president proposes not less than 3000 more planes at a cost of $300 mill ions This would bring the numerical strength of our air force to 8300 a number exceeding any other country except Germany which has 10000 or more and nearly double the effec tive air force of Great Britain and France combined However the development of airplanes is so rapid that nobody seems to really know what is the comparative air strength of the several countries War planes built four or five years ago are now relatively obsolete because more modern planes are larger more effective and have a wider cruising range and at greater speeds The war in Spain has demonstrated that new explosives also are far more destructive than those in use at the beginning of the war The adoption of the president s recommendation as to planes would provide important plane equipment to our defense and also it would go far toward making airplane construction a major industry in this country as many other nations are buying planes here Germany s great fleet of planes were in part built of supplies from this country Japan is obtaining nearly all the parts for its fighting planes from here and both Great Britain and France are large buyers of American planes and parts The  cost of production  bill for farmers is looming up at this session In principle it has been before congress since the Coolidge administration In the last congress it lacked only a few votes of passing the Senate It would authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to fix a cost of production price upon all farm products for domestic consumption and surpluses would be disposed of abroad by the government at such dumping prices as might be obtained the farmers taking the price received for the surplus exported The bill was presented to the Senate by 18 senators and nine congressmen representing all parties and sections of the country each presented it in the House TTie Department of Agriculture seeking to maintain the present crop reduc MISS JEN N IE M ERRILL Jennie Aurilla Merrill passed away at the home of her sister Mrs Ed Bopp in Alma Center on January 16 1939 after a very short illness The news of her death

deepest sympathy of all in their great loss for her first thought was for them For many years she has taken the part of a real mother to her motherless niece and nephew Mrs Eva Temple of St Paul and

charter member of the Woman s Civic club She was always a loyal and willing worker in these organizations She possessed a lovely alto voice and was a member of the M E church choir for many years She gladly gave her services whenever called upon and will be sadly missed in many ways The music for the service was given by Mrs Theodore Joos Miss Coral Stranney Dr H P Langworthy and Harold Van Gorden as a quartet and Dr Langworthy also sang   Face to Face  as a solo The members o f the local order of Rebekahs and of the Humbird lodge attended in a body and gave the burial service The Auxiliary

Pigeon Falls  Mrs Ole Rudd of York * BLACK RIVE R V S M O N DO VI Friday the 13th proved to be an unlucky day for the Orange and Black Five even though their encounter with Mondovi kept every one on edge through the entire game The first quarter showed fast play and fairly good team work The beginning of the second quarter showed Mondovi slowly but steadily gaining and by the half the score stood 2018 in favor of Mondovi During the third quarter Jerry Northup made a beautiful long shot tying the score 22all Mondovi then came back with a bang and by the end of the quarter the score was 2423 in favor of Mondovi The last quarter was just one thrill after another Both teams were vainly striving to outdo the other As in all last quarters play became tire1 some each team striving for that final basket The two teams were I working perfect but somehow the i 13th was against us the final score i being Mondovi 28 Black River Falls Falls 27 Maggie Elizabeth McCain only daughter of John and

outdo the Agricultural department in its opposition The bill would impose much higher tariffs on imported farm products disrupting the reciprical trade treaties so far as importations are concerned and the dumping of surplus farm products abroad below world prices will lead to still further complications as to the State department s foreign trade policies The bill may have a rugged road so far as other interests are concerned but it will bring the farm problem strongly to the front in this congress And if congi ess would really solve the farm problem it would find many other situations

their first defeat in eleven starts in the current season at the hands of the Alma Center five by the count of 21 to 19 With the exception of a few minutes in the first quarter the visitors were on the short end of the score throughout the game and it was only due to a desperate rally in the closing seconds of the contest that they managed to threaten the comfortable lead that the locals held during the second half Chet Johnson Carrol Raether and Wayne Nolop led the Alma Center scoring with ten four and three points respectively while honors for the Independence team were divided between Isaacs and Mish with six points each The entire Alma Center team played impressive ball in upsetting their favored opponents and by virtue of the win advanced a notch in the conference standings Since

Stanley Martin a resident of the town of Komensky since 1925 was drowned last Wednesday January 18 1939 when his truck went through the ice at Hatfield Mr Martin was hauling ice for James Blazek who had just loaded his truck and driven away Mr Martin had been in Black River Falls that morning for a load of feed and had gone for a load of ice about 11 o clock in the morning The ice was stacked on the frozen pond and the trucks drove up beside the pile to load The cold of Tuesday night had frozen over the hole from which it had been cut and a light snow covered it all Mr Martin did not stop at the pile but his car went on and through the thin ice of the hole Carl Strozewski who was there to help load was the only witness It was thought perhaps Mr Martin was faint or ill first from the fact

            for the last few weeks First Adolph Bartos  family lost their home by fire and it was a total loss At the beginning of the school term Marie Marek   the girl of smiles   was nursing a fractured arm A week ago the writer s eldest son suffered a broken leg and just lately our nearest neighbor Stanley Martin lost his life by drowning The rest of us sure do wish that Madame Misfortune would just disappear completely instead of leaving us for some other parts of the country It was one of those cold lonely winter nights dark and blustery wind velocity close to 40 miles per hour The   crack Flyer  was two minutes behind schedule as it roared through the darkness of a perfect night for a perfect crime The snowflakes like white pellets seem to all curve in to the headlight and dash themselves against the head of the engine All of a sudden with screeching of brakes and sparks flying from under the wheels to came to stop The conductor gesticulating wildly wanted to know what it was all about The engineer squinted into the darkness ahead at a looming blackness   We pause briefly now for station identification  he called back and shifted into gear The recent frequent light snow fall has given opportunity to track down wild animals humans and inhumans The wolf and his smaller cousins the foxes with their perfect circle footprints leave about the neatest trail behind their escapades This group of predatory animals are as artful in making tracks that they may follow their own trails more than twice and make it look that they had traveled by only once There was a time when footprints of white men and Redskins greatly differed Today there is very little difference Of course years back Indians wore moccasins and that made a difference but it was not that that made the difference For years or centuries the Redskins followed narrow trails and this made it necessary to place each foot just ahead of the other in a straight line making it similar to a wolf trail On the other hand the white man used to the wide roads and sidewalks of civilization leave footprints alternating each other side by side Today the Indians after a few years of hobnobbing with the palefaces frequently in town and country highways leave very identical tracks behind both wearing the same kind of foot gear NORTH B RAN CH Alice Mae and Kenneth Sheffer are on the sick list Geo

Sons HOME OIL COMPANY BLACK RIVER FALLS WISCONSIN public as no doubt the 27 questions were to the jury There were various reports and for a time nobody knew who had won the case for sure One was that Lester Dietrich was negligent  the other that Mrs Dietrich had been awarded $7000 for the death of her husband and $1500 for the loss of his society and companionship It was also thought that the amount of $4400 paid by the Standard Insurance Company under the Industrial Commission ruling would be taken from the amount of $8500 awarded by the jury but there was nothing to indicate that this amount would be deducted and it will not be known until Judge Crosby has taken it under consideration In the meantime  t is rumored that H B Kilstofte has announced that his attorneys will petition Judge Crosby to set aside the $8500 award since question No 17 was answereu   No  by the jury For the benefit of those interested questions 17 and 20 are published together with their answers Question 17  In failing to enclose such hole with a temporary guard railing and temporary toe board did defendant H B Kilstofte and his superintendent Jens Thompson fail to exercise such care as the great mass of mankind ordinarily exercises when acting under same or similar circumstances? Answer  No Question 20  At the time of and immediately prior to his injury and death did Lester Dietrich fail in any respect to exercise such care and caution for his own safety as the great mass of mankind ordinarily exercises when acting under the same of similar circumstances? Answer  Yes And there is the case As clear as mud Mrs Waldemar Andresen of Hixton Mrs Martin Hagen and Lester and Miss Hazel Fredrickson of Northfield and Mrs Theo Andresen Mrs Elma Capper and Miss Marion Faldet helped Mrs Richard Faldet celebrate her birthday anniversary recently A lovely kensington lunch was served Miss Helen Thomasgard of La Crosse has been engaged to fill the vacancy on the high school faculty caused by the resignation of Mrs Bert F Johnson effective at the close of the first semester Dr and Mrs Ben Shlimovitz went to Sparta Sunday night and were accompanied from there by Mr and Mrs Nate Shlimovitz and Dr and Mrs Harry Mannis to La Crosse where they attended a dinner which was given at the Stoddard hotel for the benefit of Jewish refugees Mr and Mrs Dudley J Mills and son Tommy returned to Des Moines Iowa today after being here to attend the funeral of the former s aunt Mrs Mary O Mills Tommy was a guest of Eugene and Alice Krohn while here C O O P E R A T IV E O IL M E ETIN G The annual meeting of the Federation Coop Oil Company will be held in the court house Friday January 27th at 10 a m Three directors Gust Kohnert Melrose  Wm Sawyer Melrose and Bert Congdon of Galesville have their terms of office expire at this time A J Smoby representing the Midland Coop Wholesale Company Minneapolis will be the guest speaker Bulk stations are located in Galesville Fall Creek and here with the main office here Delegates will be present from all branches Mrs Julius H Johnson of Taylor returned home last Wednesday after spending six weeks under treatment at a Madison hospital Her friends will be pleased to learn that she is feeling much better Red   White STORE 2 lb pkg Prunes  15c 2 lb pkg Seedless Raisins  14c 1 lb Fruit Compote  1 7 c 28 oz cans Pumpkin 2 for 25c 29 oz cans Home Style Pineapple 2 for 49c Early Riser Coffee 3  bs 45c BROW N Sugar  l b 5 c C AN E Sugar 1 0 lb bag 4 9 c 50 oz can Tomato Juice 19c  12 oz can Corn on Cob  20c  Dried Apricots per lb 1 9 c Grapefruit 6 for 19c Large Stalk Celery  10c  Bananas 4 lbs 25c Bring us your Eggs Phone 6 W e Deliver SHOP AND SAVE A T Waughtal s 3 Deliveries Daily Phone 216 Granulated Sugar 10 lb bag 49c Cash Price 100 lb bag $469 Peanut Butter  2 lb jar 23c Matches  6 box carton 19c Sturdiwheat a new delicious cereal 2 lbs 23c Bread 24 oz loaf 3 f°r 25c Peas 20 oz t in s  Gol Ban Corn 20 oz tins   Kidney Beans 20 oz tins    Cut Green Beans 19 oz tins Cut W ax Beans 19 oz tins  Sauer Kraut 27 oz tin s  Soda Crackers 2 lb boxes 2 25c Cookies  2 lbs 23c United Flour 49 lb bag every sack guaranteed $129 Dates  3 lbs 25c 425c CASH PRICE Grapefruit 126 sizedoz 2 3 c Grapefruit 96 size   doz 29c Delicious Apples  doz 17c Fancy Winesap Apples box $179 Head Lettuce 2 for 15c Cranberries  2 lbs 25c Meaty Neck Bones per lb 5 c Extra Nice Lean Pork Chops per lb 16c Sauerkraut  per quart 5c Pork Links delicious with cakes    2 lbs 35c Lamb Stew  per lb 9c Lamb Roast per lb 15c Lamb Chops 2 lbs 35c Veal Stew   per lb 9c Veal Roast per lb 16c Veal Chops  2 lbs 35c Dry Salt Pork or Bacon Squares     per lb 11c 4K Iceland Fat Herring ex fey 3 lbs 25c Ex fey Select Oysters direct from coast qt 39c Beef and Pork in Quantities at very low prices Men s Flannel Shirts going at a sacrifice  49c W O O D FOR SALE Delivered anywhere in the City Shop the IGA W ay Flour lGA Family 49 lb bag 1 3 9 Pillsbury s Best 49 lb bag 1 5 5 Baking Choc IGA 8 oz cake 1 5 c Red Sour Pitted Cherries 20 oz cans 2 f°r 2 5 c Rolled Oats IGA  3 lb pkg 1 7 c Light and Fluffy Cake Flour 44 oz pkg 1 9 g Cookies fresh Choc fingers lb 1 7 c Fresh Plain Cookies 2 ^ s 1 3 c Soap Flakes 5 pkg 2 9 c White Naptha Soap  1 0 bars 3 9 c Toilet S o ap  3 ca^e s1 0 c Salmon best red 16 oz can 2 3 c G E N U IN E S T E A K CUTS Ready to Serve Soups IGA 16 oz cans 2 for 2 3 c Cheese Longhorn  per lb 1 9 c Bacon Squares  per lb 1 2 c Picnic Shoulders per lb 1 9 c Pork Sausage per lb 1 5 c Lard bulk or pkg 2 lbs 1 9 c Anderson Food Market Phone No 1 We Deliver BRING US YOUR EGGS G R Sechler Co Phone No 5  Monarch Finer Foods  Phone No 5 Specials for Thursday Friday Sat 18 oz cans Monarch Sweet Pure Comb Potatoes 15c Honey lb 19c Yacht Club 1 large and 1 Medium pkg TunaFish 15c O xydol 28c 15^ oz pkqs pkg Monarch Salt Currants2 25c Mackerel  25c 20 oz cans Monarch Tiny Whole Green or Yellow 8 oz* Toasted Wheat Beans 2 cans 39c Pophitts  219c 25 oz can KC Baking Hand Picked Navy Powder  19c Beans 61bs25c SA T U R D A Y SPECIAL  Olson s Golden Crust Bread 24 oz loaf  3 for
