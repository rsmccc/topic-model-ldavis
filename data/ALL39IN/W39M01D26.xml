FORTYSIXTH YEAH W ITTENBERG  SHAW ANO COUNTY W ISCONSIN THURSDAY JA NUARY 26 1919 NUMBER 11
Agriculture and Labor
A griculture as represented by the
Wisconsin Council of Agriculture and
labor who have been and continue to
have their spats now appear headed
for a showdown before the Wisconsin
legislature The farm organization
composed of 37 farm organizations
and claiming to represent 80000 farm ers
has prepared a bill which if enacted
will completely rew rite the labor
act of 1937
Labor through the American Federation
of Labor and the Committee of
Industrial Organization spokesmen
continually m aintain th at they have
no quarrel with agriculture and that
the welldoing of both depends upon
cooperative effort The council of
agriculture has repeatedly issued a
sim ilar statement
Yet months ago labor was severely
criticised for its efforts to unionize a
cooperative creamery a t Richland
Center Again when farm ers in Racine
county plowed under spinach
crops because of a strike a t a cannery
labor was censured In each case the
Wisconsin Council of Agriculture has
been the chief critic
The farm council severely rebuked
labor for its p art in the Folk school at
Camp Douglas which trained young
people as group leaders for rural education
Labor was criticized for not
consulting agriculture as to its needs
in rural education
This week labor makes the same criticism
of the agricultural council that
of preparing a labor bill without consulting
labor While directors of the
farm organizations have held open
discussions a t which labor w'as invited
to express opinions on the proposed
bill labor representatives claim
th a t directors of the Council had approved
the bill before asking their
opinion
Proposed Changes
Major changes in the s ta te ’s labor
relations act if proposals of the W isconsin
Council of Agriculture are
adopted by the legislature would
1 Abolish the 3man labor board
and place employer relations in charge
of the industrial commission
2 Cut 50000 annual appropriation
to 26000
3 Outlaw sitdown strikes
4 Demand a ten day notice on
strikes which would tend to cause deterioration
or destruction of any farm
or dairy product
5 Prohibit secondary strikes and
boycotts
6  Lim it the right to strike to m ajority
groups in plants affected
Persions — Pensions — Pensions
Old age assistance the im portant
plank in every p arty platform last
fall will receive a lion’s share of a ttention
in the 1939 legislature Already
a total of six bills affecting old
age pensioners aw ait action by the
Wisconsin legislature Two of the
bills propose maximum pensions of 60
a month instead of the present 30
A bill by Assemblyman Ben Rubin
of Milwaukee Progressive provides
for maximum pensions of 60 a month
and relieves counties from contributing
to the pension fund Under present
laws the counties pay 20 per cent
of their pension costs the state pays
30 per cent and the federal governm
ent 50 per cent up to 30 Rubin
would have the state pay the counties’
share and would raise the money
through income surtax and increased
dividend and g ift taxes The bill also
changes the present ruling of the law
which denies old age assistance to persons
whose children are able to support
them and the clause which perm
its judges to place liens on homesteads
of pensioners
Two days afte r Rubin’s bill was introduced
four senators and two assemblymen
authored a bill which
1 Raises pension limits to 60 a month
2  lowers the age a t which a person
is eligible for a pension from 65 to 60
3 provides like Rubin’s bill th at the
state and federal government bear the
entire cost of pensions 4 raises the
needed revenue through a 2 per cent
tax on gross incomes of over 5000
5 specifies th at the pension money be
spent entirely in the state The
measure was sponsored by Senators
Young Zimny and Gawronski Democrats
and Gettelman Republican and
Assemblymen Balzer Democrat and
W estfahl Republican all of Milwaukee
O
ther pension bills would make
aliens who have lived in this country
for 25 years or more eligible for pensions
lower counties’ share of pension
payments from 20 to 10 per cent
raise pension maximums from 30 to
40 and repeal the liens on homesteads
of recipients of pensions
Short Week
Aside from the introduction of bills
neither senate or assembly had much
to do last week The normal procedure
of a legislative body actually occasions
lazy and monotonous sessions the first
two weeks Bills introduced m ust be
scheduled fo r hearing with adequate
public notice and only a fte r the hear j
ings and committee recommendations!
can the legislature proceed with any
degree of regularity
For th a t reason senate and assem bly
session lasted in most cases but
onehalf hour each for three days last
week Assemblymen and Senators
then adjourned on Thursday and
agreed to m eet Tuesday morning of
this week to hear in joint session as
a committee aspects of the relief problem
as presented to them by the Wisconsin
League of Municipalities
Sessions were brief with the exception
of the two hours the assembly
devoted to a discussion of a resolution
by Assemblyman Alfonsi of Iron
county Form er Speaker Alfonsi in
resolution asked the assembly to send
a memorial to congress protesting any
plash in WPA funds Alfonsi predicted
th a t if the proposed federal
slash of 150 millions is enacted by
congress th a t 25000 Wisconsin WPA
workers would lose their jobs by
June
Republicans aided by Democrats
succeeded in sending the resolution to
the committee on public welfare for
hearing over the protests of P rogressives
who m aintained th at if the memorial
was to have any effect it m ust
be passed a t once Before disposing
of it Democrat and Republican assemblymen
denounced adm inistration
of WPA in Wisconsin and Balzer Milwaukee
Democrat predicted th a t soon
WPA would be controlled by Democrats
in Wisconsin and th a t Phil Flanner
and other Progressives would be
ousted

Vaccination Is Urged
for Sleeping Sickness
Large numbers of farm ers turned
out to hear Dr Beach discuss Sleeping
Sickness among horses on Tuesday
and Wednesday in Shawano county
At the Shawano meeting there were
103 and at Tilleda there were 87
About a hundred farm ers attended the
meeting here on January 25
Dr Beach states that there is much
yet to be learned about this peculiar
disease but some of the things that
are known about it include the following
1 It is a germ disease of the filtrable
virus type meaning that the germs
are so small th at they cannot be seen
by the smallest microscope and that
they will pass through the finest
filters
2 It is evidently spread by mosquitos
and flies by transm itting blood
from an infected animal to a healthy
animal
3 The germs remain in the blood
stream for only a few days and then
localize in the brain and spinal cord
4 Vaccination with the chick vaccine
is a fairly good safeguard against
the disease Two shots are given each
horse and it requires about 14 days
for it to establish immunity The
vaccination protects for at least one
season
There are two types of sleeping
sickness—the eastern type and the
western type Both of these seemed
to spring up at about the same time
in 1930 The western type traveled
eastward and reached Shawano county
The eastern type is gradually
working west
The eastern type is more severe
about 80' of afflicted horses die of it
and it is communicable to man the
ge rms having been definitely located
in the brain of afflicted humans The
western type is from 33 to 50' fatal
It is likely that Shawano County
will take collective action to vaccinate
and protect their horses this coming
season
Setbacks pave the way for comebacks
To have the last word with a woi
man—apologize

CLOTHES FOR NEEDY
Wisconsin’s needy will be adequately
clothed this winter so long as more
than 100000 manufactured garments
valued at more than  l000000can fill
the need P D Flanner head of the
state public welfare departm ent reports
The garm ents have been received
for relief purposes from the
Works Progress Administration Flan
ner said
Distribution of the clothing is being
made through county welfare offices
under a setup sim ilar to a mail order
business The clothing was purchased
by the WPA to absorb m anufacturers’
surpluses in hopes of putting thousands
of unemployed garm ent workers
back in their jobs
Persons needing clothing go to their
local welfare offices where their needs
are carefully scrutinized Particular
care is exercised in the determination
of eligibility so th at only those who
are in need and without means of purchasing
clothing locally will receive
the order Flanner asserted
TO SEE FIRST GAMES
III
W’e do not believe there is a single
person in this community who is not
proud of the modern new gymnasium
th at was used for the first time F riday
night when Tigerton high school’s
basketball squad came to play the
local team  The fine satisfaction felt
locally th a t W’ittenberg finally has a
large beautiful and uptodate gymnasium
may account for the fact that
the defeat of the local high school by
the visiting team did not seem to have
a depressing effect on W ittenberg
fans present a t the game And for
the same reason perhaps they were
not overly excited when the tables
were turned on Tigerton in the defeat
of the City team from that place by
the local city team The one big
overpowering feeling that was evident
on all sides on the opening night was
the pleasure felt in the possession of
such a splendid gymnasium here It
is estim ated th at fully 500 people
were present on this memorable
occasion
Between the main games Laurie
Peterson principal of the high school
expressed a genuine pleasure th at the
school’s facilities had been greatly
increased by this new addition
Mr Peterson said that five years
ago when the proposition for a gymnasium
addition was turned down by
the voters he was sorely disappointed
Approximately four years later when
a sim ilar proposition was approved by
an overwhelming vote he was pleased
beyond expression Having had a
continuous connection for 20 years
with basketball and other school activities
Mr Peterson knows what a
gym means to the athletic and active
minded boys of a community And
many parents in the school district
have shown that they realize what it
means first by their vote last spring
and now by their presence a t the
opening of the gym W’e all know he
aid what it means to have children
th at are physically sound and so long
as he is permitted to remain in his
present position he aims to make the
gym a contributing factor toward
healthier individuals both young and
old Besides health he considered
safety an eeiually important thing and
said that the new building means th at
we will no longer have to crowd 300
individuals into the high school room
for assembly pregrams
Mr Peterson during his remarks
reminded the audience that this was
not the formal dedication or opening
of the gymnasium but that this would
come later after the class rooms in
the new addition had baen completed
He then called on School T reasurer
W D Haseltine who made a few
appropriate remarks and toek occasion
to toss a few bouquets to several
who had had a hand in the work of
building the new rym particularly
Ed Johnson foreman on the job
Mr Haseltine gave facts and figures
in regard to the cost of the structure
and said that the cost to the district
of the gym proper including the large
items of the heating and plumbing
equipments would be in the neighborhood
of 15000
Professor Norman E Knutzen of
thc Stevens Point State Teachers college
who was present with a number
of others from Stevens Point anel
vicinity was calle‘d upen and he responded
with hearty congratulations
to the people of W ittenberg on their
exceptionally fine gymnasium

When British P rim e M inister Neville
C ham berlain went to Rome for
consultation with P re m ie r Benito
Mussolini he knew his political futu

SENATOR BYRNES
He found a com m on denom inator
cial senate com m ittee on unem ploym
ent and relief has now proposed
creation of a new d ep artm en t of
public works to handle all such duties
except social security The
three basic recom m endations
(1) Coordination of sta te unem ploym
ent com pensation system s und
er federal law with U S financial
assistance providing 13week paym
ents ranging from 5 to 15 depending
on salary over the 26 weeks
before an unem ployed person lost
his job (2 ) increased federal p a rticipation
in statefederal old age
assistance to provide m inim um of
15 a month com pensation (3) an
anticipated annual U S public
w orks appropriation
Should the proposal be adopted
relief and security would still hold
plenty of headaches for congress
Left to be ironed out was President
Roosevelt’s proposal of “ social security
for all” under which old age
and unem ploym ent insurance protection
would be given every U S
w orker as soon as possible O ther
points in the ad m inistration’s social
security p rogram  ( 1) increased
protection to aged and dependent
children (2) establishm ent of m erit
system for sta te social security p ersonnel
(3) advancing social secu rity

Defense F a r less noteworthy than
the B yrnes report but significant of
the reorganization trend is the thusfar
anonym ous proposal to pool

defense Though sim ilar m easures

WASHINGTON—The real battle
confronting the New' Deal as P re sident
Roosevelt m ade cry stal cle a r
in his Jackson Day speech lies in
the fight for control of the 1940 D em o
cratic convention It seem s a long
tim e off to those not accustom ed to
get in terested in poiitics until the
closing days of a cam paign But
the convention is ju st one y e a r from
June the selection of delegates begins
one y e a r hence and the schem ing
to pick and control those deleg
ates is alread y under way
Most of the fire in R oosevelt’s
Jackson Day speec h it will be noted
w as against the outside elem ents
th a t have infiltrated the D em ocratic
p arty and a re now seeking to control
it He w ants all the Tweedledees
to go join their R epublican
b rethren the Tw eedledum s and let
the New D ealers run the D em ocratic
party
B ut there w ere a g re a t m any men
and women in the audience a t the
Mayflower hotel some of them show
in the photographs taken of the
P re sid en t—they w ere so close to
him —who a re not going to coo
perate on the side of the New D eale
rs in th a t battle
Leaving entirely aside those
whose opinions are clearly known
on this m a tte r one
m ight speculate as
to which side of the
battle will include
Ja m e s A F arley
who is shortly to retire
as po stm aster
general but who is
to continue probably
right up to the

Farley s Influence Blocks
Candidacy of Jackson
I t m ust be recalled to grasp the
im portance of this th at it w as larg e ly
F a rle y ’s influence th at prevented
w hat would have been the m ost
sp ectacu lar step tow ard picking a
New Deal successor for Roosevelt
It w as Farley ag ain st R oosevelt’s
strong desire who stopped the nom ination
for governor of New York of
R obert H Jackson It so happens
th at this step now tu rn s out
not to have been very im portant
as far as D em ocratic presidential
candidacies are concerned F o r it
is the consensus of political judgm
ent that if Jackson had been
nom inated T hom as E Dewey would
now be governor of New York It
would have been only by getting
elected governor of New York and
m aking a fair record at Albany
th a t Jackson could have obtained
the s ta rt tow ard the White House
d esired for him by so m any New
D ealers including the P resident
him self 
So the chief significance of the
blocking of Jack so n ’s nom ination—
assum ing that Dewey would have
beaten nearly any one except H erb
ert H Lehm an—is th a t F arley w as
willing to oppose the P re sid en t’s
plan for building up a 100 per cent
New D ealer for the presidency and
th a t he could find sufficient strength
even against the d esires of the P re s ident
to m ake th a t objection stand
It would seem reasonable to suppose
therefore th a t F arley  with
m uch the sam e backing he had last
sum m er will be able to prevent the
selection of delegates from New
York who could be sw ung solidly to
any other outandout New D ealer

Subsidy Price for Silver
Causes Many Red Faces
T here are a good m any red faces
as the result of the continuance of
the present subsidy price for silver
m ined in the United States Secreta
ry of thc T reasury H enry M orgenthau
J r  is am ong those who thought
the price should be reduced and expected
it would be
Senator John Townsend of D elaw
are has introduced a resolution
providing for an inquiry into the
whole silver policy The n atu ral inference
would be th a t this would be
shelved but there a re several senato
rs even on the prosilver side
who would like nothing b etter than
to have a thorough public airing and
discussion of the g overnm ent’s silver
policy
A ctually of course the treasu ry 
with the approval of the P resident
h as flagrantly ignored the law It
is a crazy law and this w riter believes
th at the P re sid en t and Mr
M orgenthau should be com m ended
for not obeying it But it should be
repealed if it is not to be obeyed
As a m atter of fact it would have
to be repealed very shortly if the
treasu ry should m ake a really conscientious
effort to obey it However
the proceeding would cost the
taxpayers of this country a good
m any billion dollars before the repeal
would ensue
The point is th a t the law directs
the tre a su ry to keep on buying silv
er until the am ount of silver held
is onefourth of the value of all the
gold and silver held by the governm
en t—o r—until the price of silver
shall reach one dollar and twentynine
cen ts an ounce
The law w as passed back in 1933
V ery shortly the treasu ry sta rte d
buying silver on the world m ark et
When it began the world price of
silv er w as fortyfive cents an ounce
By prodigious buying and with
m any speculators all over the world
convinced th at the U S treasu ry
would be able to do ju st th a t to the
world price the asking price g ra d ually
advanced It went above
eighty cents
O nly Persons to Profit
Have Been Foreigners
T hen the tre a su ry abruptly
stopped the trem endous speculation
The only persons to profit to any
extent had been foreigners In the
first place all silver then above
ground in the United S tates had
been nationalized and w as bought by
the governm ent a t fifty cents an
ounce In the second if an A m erican
bought silver in som e foreign
m a rk e t—and som e did—the speculator
w as taxed 50 per cent of his
profit T his w as a special tax on the
tran sactio n  and of course w as in
addition to any incom e tax Incidentally
an investigation w as
s ta rte d to discover who w as speculating
in silver N am es of wives of
sen ato rs and all so rts of bigwigs
w ere discovered The investigation
w'as dropped
W ithout treasu ry bidding up the
p rice of silver prom ptly dropped
back to w here it had been before
the buying cam paign sta rted  In
fact it w ent below th at and is now
hovering around fortythree cents
So th a t the treasu ry not only h as a
trem endous loss on all the silver it
bought abroad during the buying
sp ree but has a loss of seven cents
an ounce on all the silver it took
over from A m erican citizens
T his huge loss augm ented by the
subsidy price paid for silver m ined
inside the United S tates which has
ju st been continued until next June
when the law expires does not show
on the treasu ry books The tre a s ury
does not adm it the loss
‘Peace at A ny Price Lobby

is the first im portant public official
in 1900 y e a rs who m ade a public
sta te m e n t supporting th a t p articu lar
sta te m e n t of the Savior
But the P resident m ak es a strong
and ra th e r convincing case for the
arg u m en t th a t religious freedom  in
fact religion itself is dependent
upon dem ocracy and goes right on
from there to prove th at dem ocracy
is dependent upon defensive a rm a m

It is a queer and to the peace at
any price crowd a very annoying
argum ent They prefer texts like
“ turning th e other cheek” and “ the
m eek shall inherit the e a rth ” and
others glorifying the virtues and efficiency
of nonresistance They
p refer the attitude of the early
C hristian m a rty rs who died in
physical agony but spiritu al e x altation
to the thought of a bright and
shining sw ord to defend th eir re ligious
freedom

they can point out th a t not to vote j
for big arm y and navy a p p ro p riations
is to endanger religious freedom
in this country
Most of them intended to do ju st
that anyhow  but now they can do
it with considerably less w orry In
fact they think the P re sid en t's add
ress m ay stifle in advance a lot of
the opposition they m ight otherw ise
have had from the good folks who
believe in the virtue of nonresist j
ance And how it does help them j

Nmwt gtve your children unknown
■m you aik your doctor
A mother may save a few pennies
Riving her children unknown preparations
But a child’s life is precious
beyond pennies So— A sk your
doctor before you give any remedy
you don’t know all about
And when giving the common
children's remedy milk of magnesia
always ask for "Phillips’ ’
Milk of Magnesia
Because for three generations
Phillips’ has been favored by many
physicians as a standard reliable
and proved preparation — marvelously
gentle for youngslers
Many children like Phillips in
the newer form — tiny peppermintflavored
tablets that chew like
candy Each tablet contains the
equivalent of one teaspoonful of the
liquid Phillips' 25f for a big box
A bottle of Phillips' liquid Milk
of Magnesia costs but 25/ So—anyone
can afford the genuine Careful

The next fortnight w as spent by
Mr K neeland’s new em ployee in an
occupation one of our distinguished
P residents has described as “ w atchful
w aiting” He m ingled He cultivated
every m em ber of the group
even Ainsworth He w as reasonably
successful in concealing his
growing dislike of th a t young m an
though he frequently intercepted
and returned Ainsw orth’s barbed
d a rts a t his em ployer He also interru
p ted without hesitation and
sidetracked m any of C raig’s lurid
medica4 yarn s He w ent on num erous
m otorboat excursions with B ert
and w as pained to find the youth increasingly
nervous and fidgety
He took frequent w alks in the
woods and along the shore with
Joan o r M rs Spencer Forbes Miss
I Hosanna explained th a t she herself
! had all the exercise she w anted
around the house She had She
was up early and late She was
constantly busy Hale picked up
her balls of silk or wool in her rest
periods He played frequent gam es
of desperation or backgam m on with
her He listened respectfully to her
dietetic theories and her reiterated
i statem en ts th at all the dishes he
liked best w ere “ poison” He becam e
increasingly popular with Joe
Banks and Rose and won J a n e ’s
h e a rt by friendly attention to Daisy
He successfully concealed his inte
re st in the fact th a t the anim al
so robust when she arriv ed  was now
in a low sta te of health She moped
and objected to petting He had two
m ore long talks with C asper Kneeland
Once Kneeland again referred
to his wife’s tragic death “ She had
puerperal insanity” he explained
“ She tried to give m e another son
and it finished her I haven’t spoken
of it since not even to B ert C an’t
bear to talk about it”
Hale took care of all letters to
C asper Kneeland which cam e to
Halcyon Camp He w rote a num ber
of letters of his own Two of
these w ere addressed to distinguished
p sychiatrists he knew one
of them in Chicago and the other—
to whom he had once been of some
service—in Paris U nostentatiously
and with considerable ingenuity he
| secured the fingerprints of m ost
m em bers of the household Those
prints when developed m ight lead
to the discovery of the m ysterious
a rtist a t Halcyon C am p and the
w riter of the anonym ous letters
His collection of letters and
sketches had grown T here was a
sketch of a grave and a tom bstone
with his nam e on the latte r T here
w ere dancing skeletons labeled in
the sam e way They rem inded him
ra th e r uncannily of his d ream  after
the first office interview with Casper
K neeland T here w as a large
sketch of a skull It w as treated
with a phosphorescent preparation
and grinned at him brilliantly from
1 the foot of his bed one night after
I the lights w ere off T here were
| m ore m isspelled notes urgently re
! peating the advice of the original
I rtote th a t he leave Halcyon Camp
| On one occasion th ere was a frog in
j his bed L ater a colony of ants
w ere sheltered there Several nights
after this half a dozen w asps w ere
let loose in his room Twice his
room w as upset—his bed dism antled
the furniture overthrow n a
whirlwind of new spapers and torn
sc rap s tossed about Once Rose discovered
this and cleaned it up Hale
m ade no explanation and the
m aid’s m an n er was d istan t for seve
ra l days The other tim e he found
the litter first and cleared it aw ay
him self Why should someone be
so anxious to get rid of him? He
didn’t tell anyone about the petty
persecutions but he w as increasingly
irritated by them 
Meanwhile he chafed m entally
under his app aren t lack of the
“ progress” Kneeland wordlessly dem
anded He held him self in with s
tight rein “ I ’ve got to learn all I
can learn about the ch ara c te rs and
in terests of these people” he rem
inded him self " I ’ll tu rn them
inside out before I get through with
them  But not y et”
The objects of his special study
w ere the two younger Kneelands
He w as increasingly disturbed about
them both B ert w as riding for a
nerve crash He w as increasingly
moody and erratic
But it w as Joan who w as H ale’s
greatest interest He w alked sw am 
talked with her daily He danced
with her at night They discussed
countless subjects with ap parent intim
acy Yet he never felt that he
really knew her If she had been
the victim of a desperately unhappy
love affair she m ight have looked
and acted as she often did—like a
dctached being w andering in space
At such tim es it w as im possible to
interest or am use her At others
she w as anim ated alm ost gay
T here were hours even days when
she w as as n atu ral with him as
she w as with Bert T here w ere other
hours when she teased him unm
ercifully She professed h ersell
young Hale He had started something
He ra th e r wished he hadn't
The whole thing m ight be nothing
but a m a re 's nest He had given it
entirely too m uch im portance in
their talk He returned w ith his
plate m editating on the best way to
let down the exuberant youngster
a t the other end of the table Before
undertaking this he swallowed
a cup of coffee He felt better Sim
ultaneously Joan entered the
room Both m en were startled by
her pallor and the dark circles und
er her eyes but she seem ed in
good spirits She sm iled and nodded
and H ale hurried to the sideboard
to serve her He always
moved with surprising lightness and
agility for so large a young man
“ A little of everything?” he asked
as he raised dish covers
“ H eavens no” Joan shuddered
“ You ought to know by this tim e
th a t I ’m never interested in breakfast
Only a slice of hot toast and
a glass of orange juice please And
yes Rose I ’ll have some coffee
T hanks’’
Hale brought h er the toast and o range
juice and returned to his own
breakfast feeling softpedaled
He was im pressionable It had
not taken him long to discover that
In the speeding road ster tbe tw e m en w ere silent
one of his countless victim s and assured
him th at his indifference w as
blasting her life
“ W hat’s really the m a tte r with
Joan K neeland?” he once asked
Craig when he could endure the
problem no longer
The p sychiatrist looked at him in
surprise
“ N erves” he said coldly "H alf
our young girls a re like th at nowadays
Too m any bad hab its”
“She h asn ’t any bad h ab its” Hale
insisted “ except perhaps th a t she
sm okes too m uch”
“ F a r too m uch” the doctor
agreed His thin lips sm iled unpleasantly
“ H er love affair with
B ert isn’t helping any” he ended
“ What the devil do you m ean by
th a t? ”
“ Ju st w hat 1 say Though perhaps
I should have said his love
affair with her He’s crazy about
her and she knows it She knows
he is suffering ‘Pity is akin to
love’ P erhaps after all natu re is
trying to push her into m arrying
him ”
“ Damn you” Hale said under his
breath It w as the first tim e he
had lost his tem per with any of
them  He walked aw ay fum ing under
the m em ory of C raig’s lifted
eyebrow s and ironic sm ile
One Monday m orning—the third
after H ale’s arriv al a t the C am p—
C asper Kneeland cam e down to his
eight o’clock breakfast He found
his new em ployee already at the ta ble
consum ing eggs and bacon
H ale w as dressed in his new gray
business suit T here w as an air of
alertn ess and energy about him
which Kneeland privately felt w as
oppressive when exhibited before
nine o’clock in the m orning He
greeted Hale with a nod and am bled
over tow ard the hot dishes on the
sideboard
“ Qood m orning s ir” the secreta
ry said cheerfully “ I thought if
you didn’t m ind I’d drive into town
with you”
“ Eh? W hat’s the idea of th a t? ”
Kneeland interrupted his inspection
of the breakfast dishes to turn
and sta re at his godson Realizing
th at his attitude was not hospitable
he added gloomily “ It will be hot
in New York”
" I t will” Hale agreed “ But when
th e re ’s work to be done I like to
get sta rte d ”
“ Uh huh”
K neeland filled his plate He was
alw ays at his worst before breakfast
and he hated cheerfulness and
conversation in others till he had
drunk his coffee He was also experiencing
som e dark doubts as to
tho wisdom of his arra n g em en t with
the life of the houseparty would not
be required to function at breakfast
N evertheless it was a time
when he alw ays felt a t his best He
ate eggs and kidneys and bacon
and three hot muffins and waited
for someone else to speak No one
did Rose refilled the coffee cups as
seriously as if perform ing a religious
rite Uncle C ass stoked solem
nly and grew more reconciled to
life At last Joan spoke
“ We have now reached the point
w here it is safe to sm ile across the
table at U ncle” she told Hale “ Not
hands across the table you know—
m erely sm iles Don’t speak yet
You have com m itted several tim es
since you cam e to us the faux pas
of wishing Uncle ’good m orning’ ”
“ I have” Hale sighed
“ And a frost hung over the table
and icicles hung from U ncle’s eyebrows
while the hot food congealed
on the sideboard I know” Joan
said sym pathetically “ I saw it all
every tim e you did it I used to
do it every m orning when I first
cam e to live with Uncle I was
young and heedless then At last I
learned that jf I neither breathed
nor spoke till he had eaten his
breakfast all would be well He’s
quite hum an from half past eight
o n”
Rex looked at his watch
“ I t’s only eight twenty now” ho
said under his breath “ I ’ve already
told him I thought I ’d drive to New
Y ork with him! You see Joan our
uncle has given m e one of theso
governm ent em ergency jobs to
keep m e busy during the sum m er
I m yself m ust find the work dor
m y little hands to do Today I ’m
going to tra c e down a rum or that
som e North River coalheaver is
fastening his shirt to his trousers
w ith one of our Uncle’s patented
safety catches T h at’s in direct violation
of the code If I catch him
a t it there will be som ething doing
in the industrial world”
“ If there is it will be the first
tim e this sum m er” Kneeland
groaned But he swallowed his third
cup of coffee with resignation and
winked at Joan
“ Thinks pretty well of him self
this lad” he told her “ Did you
h ear him calling you Joan? And before
he had been in the house th iee
w eeks!”
“ Did I do th a t? ” Rex looked su rprised
and then thoughtful “ I suppose
it w as because I alw ays think
o l her that way Where do you want
m e to stop Uncle Cass the days I ’m
in tow n?”
“ I suppose you m ight as well
com e to the house” Kneeland said
resignedly “ I’m in it nights from
Mondays to F ridays I have a darky
there to keep the place in order and
get m y break fasts”
“ He m ay keep you there too if
you never speak before nine” Joan
contributed
"And if he occasionally stops
speaking after nine” Kneeland m uttered
“ Your luncheons and dinners
you can take w herever you
like Rex as I do”
“ I wonder if I like the nam e of
R ex” Joan mused aloud
"O f course you do I t’s a beautiful
nam e You’ll find th at it com es
very trippingly from the tongue”
" Is n ’t it rath er pretentious? 1
thought only young m en in books
had it”
"T here are a few poor devils in
real life who struggle along under
it too” Rex confessed with sudden
gloom
“ If you’re going to New York
with me young m an” Kneeland
broke in "you will be at the front
door in five m inutes”
"And in five pieces in ten m inutes
I know Will you excuse me Joan?
I ’ll break a lance for you during
the com bat of the day O r perhaps
it will be only the springs of U ncle’s
c a r I think I ’ll drive”
He raced upstairs for his hat
raced down again flung him self
into the roadster Joe had left at
the front door and seized the wheel
Kneeland lum bered after him and
Joan stared after them both What
inexhaustible vitality th a t young
m anhad! It w as im possible to think
of him as ill or suffering and yet
he had been both and that very
recently She herself felt like a
rag She decided to go back to her
room and rest a bit before the
bathing hour The bathing hour
seem ed to take a lot out of her She
went upstairs with dragging steps
In the speeding roadster the two
men were silent Kneeland was observing
Hale’s driving and deciding
that it was all right The younger
m an ’s thoughts were on the girl he
had just left She had looked really
ill this morning Her beauty was
dim m ed by her pallor but the
pathos of it m ade her m ore appealing
to him Her eyes looked as if
she had not slept Which of all
the strain s in that sinister cam p
w as the strain that was consuming
her?
T hese som ber thoughts continued
to occupy his mind until they a r rived
in New York

Before Fire in H ouse G ains H ead w ay
Within a few seconds after fire
break s out in your home the household
can be warned by a howling
alarm which is sim ply screw ed into
a light socket says P opular Mechanics
This detector u tters an unm
istakable shriek if the tem p erature
in the room rises a t a sustained
ra te of 15 or 20 degrees per m inute
This “ rateofrise” therm ostat will
catch the fire before it has reached
dangerous proportions yet will not
cause false alarm s from ordinary
changes in room tem p eratu re due to
w eather o r winter heating of the
building
Plugged into a ceiling socket in
basem ent attic or closet—danger
spots for fires in the hom e—it will
detect any sudden surge of h eat alm
ost instantly The rateofrise feature
is operated hy a sm all airexpansion
cham ber with an extrem ely
sensitive diaphragm which bellows
out when the tem p eratu re rises in
the air cham ber and closes an electric
al contact T here is an additional
th erm o stat which in the event
when the I'oom tem p eratu re reaches
150 degrees
The signal operates on alternating
cu rren t and uses about eight w atts
A tiny neon lam p consum ing fourtenths
watt shows th at the cu rren t
is on The detector readjusts itself
after the fire is extinguished and
need not be replaced Extension
howlers and detectors can be connected

What’s This! A Shadow?
GOLD!
Once upon a time long long ago
there lived a king whose love of gold
was greater than his love for anything
else in life He had a pile of
gold in his counting house and
thither he would resort when he had
a spare moment to feel and handle
the precious metal One day he voiced
a wish “Would that everything I
could lay hands on would turn to
gold” By magic he was given the
golden touch Gold became the chair
the table the floor the flowers the
windows Gold became the w ater in
his golden glass as he lifted it to his
lips for a drink Gold became his fork
and the food it held His only daughter
turned to gold King Midas longed
for the simple the natural the living
as he had never longed for gold He
had had too much of a good thing
Men have killed one another for
gold Men have spent their lives in
quest of gold Men have left home
and kindred in their search for this
precious metal They have explored
islands mountains the cold white
nortbland and even the bottom of the
ocean to obtain gold which buys for
one all the glamorous beautiful and
exciting things of life and which ha
destroyed so much life
"Last year in the course of experiments
for another purpose Dr
Charles S Gibson of London discovered
how to make an extremely thin
film of gold And this leads to astonishing
possibilities for example evening
gowns of solid gold as light as !
vilk but lasting forever A gossamer
thin fabric dipped in gold compound
will take on a film of gold And it
makes w hatis to all purposes a solid
gold dress inside and out! The same
film can be deposited on ordinary
glass or china ware so that at very
little cost you can have goblets or a
complete dinner service of gold And
golden mirrors will he within almost
anyone’s reach
"True you can't go into a store and
buy any of these good things They
are not yet in commercial production
But they will be we feel sure And
then perhaps we shall see w hether the
(iilbert and Sullivan song holds good
'When every single thing you hold
Is made of silver or of gold
You long for simple pewter'
(W oman’s Home Companion) j
And the source of our quotation re j
minds us of the man who stopped at j
a news stand in obedience to his wife’s
request that he bring her "The i
Woman’s Home Companion” and asked
Will you give me the last issue of
“The Homely Woman’s Companion?”
HAcre W heal Corn Farm s
May Be Non Allot ment
Shawano county farm ers whose
corn or wheat allotments under the
1939 Farm Program are less than
eight acres may choose to have these
crops treated as general soildepletion
rops for payments made on the farm
and grow up to eight acres of either
wheat or corn without deductions a n nounces
O B Hagen chairman of the 1
Shawano county agricultural conservation
committee
This change Mr Hagen explains is
one of the new provisions of the 1939
Farm Program designed to make the
program more applicable to the small
farm
“Generally speaking the 1939 program
is essentially the same as the
1988 program but there are some
hanges which will interest most
farm ers because they offer greater advantages
than before” declares Mr
Hagen
Officials explain that if a farm er’s
illotment of either wheat or corn is
'ess than 8 acres he may take advanage
of the “8acre clause’’ by requesting
to have his farm considered a nonillotment
farm for the crop On these
farms payment will be made on the
oin and wheat allotment as the case
nay be at the rate for general crops
and deductions will not be made at the
leduction rate for the crops unless the
1C reage exceeds eight acres If th
nonallotment option for a crop i
lected no price adjustm ent paymen
r loan will be available for the crop

JAM ES B BORDEN
For several years it has been said
at the state capitol that there w ere
two men who knew more about state)
finances and taxation than any o th e r1
two men in the state
These two men were Jam es B Borden
state budget director and
Thomas M Duncan former secretary
to Gov La Follette
And now Jim Borden is dead having
passed away Monday night after
suffering a collapse from overwork
Tommy Duncan is out of the state
service
A big hole will be left in the state
service by the death of Mr Borden
Jim Borden was a student of state
finances and though W’isconsin has
had a number of governors of all
political affiliations they kept Jim
Borden on the job because of his broad
knowledge of state finances and his
loyalty to the state
State finances are a very technical
subject and require men with specialized
training and ability Mr Borden
was a public servant who met those
requirements
Mr Borden has been a fine public
official of the highest integrity and
his death is a big loss to the state of
Wisconsin—The Capital Timos

Every Wisconsin fisherman between
the ages of 18 and 70 w hether he
uses a rod and reel or an ordinary
cane pole will have to buy a 1 fishing
license if a bill introduced by Senator
G Erie Ingram Progressive becomes
a law
Present laws require the licenses
only for rod and reel users The proposed
new law would require a license
for every hook and line fisherman j
A nother hill by Ingram would ’aise

any slip should not show through |

the toes well for how shocking to
see a soiled toe peeping out from

Speaking about shoes—they m ust
be aired frequently It is a good
idea to shake in the shoe a little

C Houston Goudiss Analyzes the Food Values of Nuts
Discusses Their Place in the Menu
By C HOUSTON GOUDISS
T H E R E is one food th a t can lay claim to being alm ost univ
ersal It is eaten w ith relish by people in alm ost every
q u a rte r of the globe It form s a m ain a rtic le of diet for the
n ativ es of som e trop ical countries and is said to have been
im p o rta n t in the d ietary of ea rly se ttle rs in A m erica I refer
to nuts
N uts of course a re seeds But unlike m ost o ther seeds
used for food by m an  they grow in a h a rd shell th a t does
not open natu rally when ripe
T his form s a sealed package
which m akes nuts easy to
sto re and com paratively easy
to keep
la rg e r p art of the A m erican dieta
ry    chiefly because they ar«
such an econom ical source of protein
and of energy values Though
they can be used for a m ain dish
as an altern ativ e to m eat it is not
advisable to allow them to rep lace
m ilk or eggs
It is highly desirable how ever
th a t hom em akers and th eir fam ilies
regard nuts as a food and not
as a tidbit to be served a t the end
of a m eal th a t is alread y nutritionally
adequate
A Concentrated Food
N uts a re a highly concentrated
food and provide a large am ount
 of food value in a
sm all convenient
form  Once they
are shelled there
is very little w aste
in using them  It
has been suggested
therefore that
they m ight profitably
ap p ear in the
daily m enu far
m o r e frequently
than they do
T here are m any
different kinds of nuts and they
vary in composition Some of
them contain large am ounts of
both protein and fat O thers contain
a preponderance of fat while
a third group is starchy
T he protein of m any nuts has
been found to be ra th e r sim ilar to
th a t in m eat and fish In fact
m ost nuts are classed as com plete
proteins m eaning th at their protein
is of a type which is capable
both of supporting growth and repairing
wornout body tissue

Stum bling over vines and roots we floundered helplessly in th at tropic
sw am p L ate in the afternoon we cam e out on a bit of solid ground
beside the river We tried to head u pstream  but ran into another
sw am p We m ade our way back to the high ground and all night we
huddled there cold and w et with the rain dinning in our ears Dawn
found us w retched with hunger and th irst for with all the w ater around
us none of it w as safe to drink A cross the riv er we could see waving
ban an a leaves O ver th ere would be tra ils and a trolley line leading to
th e railroad If we could only get acro ss”
But to get across th at riv er m eant sw im m ing—and the river
w as full of alligators On the other hand it would be alm ost
a s bad to go back into the jungle In front of F re d 's eyes was
a picture of a native he had found a month before He had been
lost for 13 days and when F re d found him he had gone into his
last sleejv—a shrunken body covered with torn and festered skin
E ven alligators would be b etter th a n that
I t w as B at who decided F red B at w as ju st over an attack of
fever and he w as the w eaker of the two ‘ Stay h ere and rot if you
w ant to” he croaked “ I ’m going across the riv e r” Fred felt the
sa m e way about it He told Bat to go ahead—th at he'd stay on the bank
w ith a rifle and “ cover” his crossing with his big au tom atic rifle C arrying
the lighter rifle—a 22—Bat called his dog and plunged into the
w ater He m ade steady progress and no alligators showed their noses
above the surface of the stream  But F red was relieved when at last
he clim bed up on the other bank
‘‘B at motioned to m e to com e along” says F red ‘‘and with a sick
feeling I m ade a few sim ple preparations My rifle was m uch too
heavy and aw kw ard to hold so I unlaced my belt half way threaded it
through the trig g er guard and refastened it around my waist This p erm
itted the b arre l to swing between my legs and gave m e freedom to
kick As I entered the w ater it occurred to m e th at Bat w as covering
m y approach w ith a 22 full of w ater A 22 wouldn’t even dent an allig
a to r’s tough hide But by then I w as out in the c u rre n t and sw im m ing”
F red sw am steadily He w as m aking it And then when he
w as a scant 15 feet from shore som ething struck him a terrific
blow in the sm a ll of the back At th at m om ent F re d had visions
of a big scaly snout poking a t him before m aking the final grab
An alligator! Panic seized him  He threw up his hands and
scream ed “ Oh my God!' And as he did so he got a glim pse of
B a t's face above him —and h o rror w as w ritten all over it
He C raw led A shore and Fell F ace Down
“ I th rash ed m adly in the w ater he says “ and as I did so I
felt bottom w ith my knees 1 craw led ashore and flopped face
down on the ground gagging and retching with nausea I lay
th ere for a while and then B at helped me to my feet and steadied
m e while 1 took the rifle off m y b elt”
As they sta rte d to walk aw ay neither m an spoke Nothing w as
said about F re d ’s terrifying experience D arkness had fallen again
w hen afte r m uch stum bling they cam e to the trolley line th at led to the
railro ad  J u s t before m idnight they cam e in sight of the winking lights
of th eir plantation cam p They took som e whisky and a stiff dose of
quinine apiece—and went to bed
The n ext m orning F red got up and began taking stock—and
got the surp rise of his life When he cam e to exam ine his rifle
he found th a t the b arre l w as split from the muzzle alm ost up to
the stock Then he asked Bat a few questions—they h adn’t spoken
of th at swim across the river before—and foundnut all about that
“ allig ato r” th a t had given him such a scare the evening before
T hat alligator ju st didn’t exist It w as the gun th a t had given him
th a t poke “ The motion of sw im m ing” Fred says “ had pushed the
catch off ‘safety ’ and the d rag against the belt had pulled the trigger
The cartrid g e exploding under w ater created a terrific recoil which
drove the stock of the gun into the sm all of my back B at had seen
w hat took place and thought from m y cries th at I had been shot Hence
th e expression of horror on his face And I of course thought it was
because som ething had attacked me My m ind had been too dazed to
realize the folly of sw im m ing wifh a loaded gun”
And another folly F re d says h e’ll never rep eat is going to the rescue
of a halfw itted dog

Comparison With Grains
B ecause they a re som ew hat
I sim ilar in nutritional ch ara c te r
j nuts have been com pared to vari
I ous grains In reg ard to protein
how ever they m ay be said to
I serve as a supplem ent to the proteins
of som e grains
The high fuel value of m any
nuts is due to their fat content
Coconuts pecans and w alnuts are
especially rich in fat containing
respectively 506 per cent 705 per
cent and 64 4 per cent of fat A
few v arieties such as chestnuts
and lichi nuts so popular with
the Chinese a re m ore notable for
th eir carbohydrates Like m ost
sta rch y foods chestnuts are im proved
by cooking and th e re fore
a re preferably roasted before
eating F resh chestnuts contain
a little over 42 per cent and
dried ch estnuts a little over 74 per
cent of carbohydrates
vestigators however determ ined
a s a resu lt of careful experim ents
th at in adu lts the calcium of alm
onds w as fairly well utilized by
the body It is not as well utilized
however as the calcium of milk
N uts a re not regarded as a significant
source of any vitam in except
B though som e kinds have
also been found to contain vitam in
A As they a re frequently served
in com bination with fruits however
   in salad s and as desse
rts    the fruitnut com bination
usually supplies a substantial
am ount of m inerals and vitam ins
Place in the Menu
B ecause of th eir content of protein
and fat nuts a re frequently
com pared with m eats and may
be used interchangeably with
m eats They m ake a splendid protein
food to serve a t lunch supper
or even dinner They a re especially
good when com bined with
vegetables o r a carbohydrate
food such as rice o r noodles and
m ade into croquettes patties and
casserole com binations th a t constitu

Thorough Mastication Desirable
It is also im portant to encourage
the thorough chewing of nuts
as this helps to m ake them m ore
easily digestible For children nut
b utters a re especially desirable
Some nuts a re also p repared in
the form of m eal or pastes In
these form s it is not difficult for
the digestive juices to pen etrate
them  and nuts m ay be considered
as easily digestible as other
foods of sim ilar composition Because
they are highly co n cen trated
as we have seen it is also advisable
to include foods containing
a generous am ount of bulk o r cellulose
when nuts are included in a
m enu
A Food—Not a Tidbit
N utritionists a re of the opinion
th a t nuts m ight well constitute a
M rs B T L—T here is no imp
o rtan t change in the nutritive
quality of eggs when they are
cooked As this food does not contain
vitam in C it cannot be destroyed
in the cooking
Mrs D T F —The reason th a t
som e pickles a re a light green in
color is th at chlorophyll is p artially
destroyed during ferm en tation
This is probably due a t
least in p a rt to the acid form ed
during ferm entation

Mineral and Vitamin Values
The am ount of m ineral salts in
nuts v aries with the type Generally
speaking however nuts are
considered a rich source of phosphorus
and a good source of m an ganese
and of copper and iron re quired
for the form ation of the
hemoglobin or red pigm ent in the
blood
Most nuts are considered a poor
source of calciu m  or at best only
a fa ir source of this m ineral which
is required for helping to build

Safety M easure—C hem ical fire
extinguishers have saved many
j hom es from being reduced to
ashes Even a bucket of sand or
dam p saw dust is effective if used
before a fire gets too m uch sta rt
  
F o r Coffee S tains—Remove coffee
sta in s from table linen with
glycerin Apply glycerin and let
stand th ree o r four hours o r until
stain disappears
  
Cleaning Isinglass—Apply vineg
a r on a cloth to the sta in s on
isinglass on stoves With a little
rubbing the stain s will com e off
  
Lowering High C eilings—One
way to help m ake a ceiling look
lower is to use sim ple valances at
high windows
  
The C h ild s C h a ir—A child’s
dining ch air should be only deep
enough to support his back and
yet shallow enough to allow his
knees to bond nnd it should have
a support if the child’s feet do not

F o r B aby's Safety—Keep the
handles of k ettles on the stove
turned tow ard the back
  
Save Vour B ack—W hether to
buy a stove with a working su rface
over a low oven or a high
oven it m ay pay to rem em b er

as m uch energy as standing
  
F o r G ravy o r Soup—When you
wish to m ake gravy or soup with
the w ater in which m eat has been
cooked wring a cloth out in cold
w ater and stra in the liquor
through it No grease will go
through

One teaspoon of onion juice or half
a sliced raw onion added to
