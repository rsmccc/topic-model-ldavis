BLACK RIVER FALLS
ATTE N TIO N IS CALLED
Speaking o f calling attention we
would like to call some to the refreshing
viewpoint o f the Galesville
Republican in re taxes To say the
least it is out o f the ordinary And
there is considerable food for thought
in the following editorial 
Why Should Tax Payment Be
Distasteful
Calling attention to the recent act
o f the state legislature in providing
for an extension in payment o f real
estate taxes to July 1 the Wonewoc
Reporter starts off by saying Excuse
us for bringing up this distasteful
subject and then goes on to explain 
The Republican protests the Reporter s
expression 
Why should taxes be a distasteful
subject 
Why any more than payment o f
rent electric water gas phone or
any other bills 
Taxes are to pay for something for
which the taxpayer has had value received 
In Galesville or any other similar
community were there no taxes there
would be no schools no public buildings 
no pavement no street lights 
no parks no water or sewer system 
no fire department no police garbage
removal no band concerts no
public library nor many other things
which now go to make for better living 
And as for taxes to pay essentials 
that old saying o f Ben Franklin that
we are taxed by ourselves thrice as
much for our follies as we pay to the
public treasury still holds good 
In a recent column Upton Sinclair 
noted writer said:
 A ll taxes are unpopular They are
negative measures reducing the people s
spending power Of course the
poor are willing to tax the rich so
we have income and inheritance
taxes The old are willing to tax
the young so we have the Townsend
plan and the Ham and Eggs proposition 
But nobody is willing to
tax himself and these proposals fail
at the polls because so many o f our
people are still taxpayers 
COMMON SENSE CONSERVATION
By L H Kingston
Governor Heil s appointment o f
Mark Catlin Sr Appleton to the
conservation commission will meet
with the general approval o f sportsmen
in the northeastern part o f the
state and wherever else he is known 
I do not know Mr Catlin personally
but his writings prove him to be a
fine sportsman an outdoorsman with
years o f experience and an angler
who really knows his way around 
He has represented Outagamie
county as county conservation committeeman
and he was elected in 1936
by the committeemen in his district
to the executive council o f the state
conservation congress He is popular
amoung fellow sportsmen 
The casual observer will say that
Mr Catlin s presence on the commission
should greatly benefit conservation
in Wisconsin but I think his appointment
has much more significance
than that 
Study the personnel o f the conservation
commission over recent
years and you will notice that lumbermen 
resort owners and commercitl
fishermen always have had their
representatives on the commission 
which is as it should be but do you
see anybody who might be considered
as representing hunters fishermen 
and conservationists No the fellows
who pay a large part o f the conservation
bills in this state have not
been represented at all; instead politicians
and party wheelhorses have
been receiving the lion s share o f the
appointments 
If Mr Catlin s meritous appointment
marks the end o f the pay off o f
political obligations by appointments
on the conservation commission I
think that sportsmen and conservationists
will extend to Governor Heil
their vote o f thanks 
Misses Loraine and June Taylor
entertained friends at their home on
Thursday evening They spent the
evening playing Chinese checkers and
lunch was served

Here s that column again We just
can t bear to stay away so here goes
on the latest events of our deah ol 
Alma Mammy 
Romance data: In case you re behind
the times and haven t heard (or
observed it s very evident) the
 dark eyed lad and red headed gal 
referred to in a note in this paper
some time ago were none other than
Loren Young and Lucille Bowman 
Oh yes and what blond senior has
been giving his attentions to Mary
Boyer lately Leading candidate for
prom queen so far has been Betty
Northup a sophomore However you
can t tell about Stanley and some
think he may resort to his own junior
class where two little fems with the
initials o f N P and L B have a
good chance 
While we re on this subject o f
prom although it must be at least
two months away the juniors certainare
talking it up early So mind
we give a few words o f friendly
advice to the stronger sex Here
tis: Get your prom date early
(don t be like S G ) A fter all 
 the girl isn t going to wait forever
you to ask her The old saying 
 first come first served applies here
oo So start thinking and ask your
queen now 
Don t be bashful 
Don t dare to rest 
Just take her by the hand 
And hope for the best 
Now for some advice to the fair
sex (My aren t we motherly )
Start looking at the style books 
L ife says skirts are getting shorter
nd shorter W oo W oo And don t
forget to look your best every day so
11 take notice 
(Say how about a quarter juniors 
the boost we ve been giving you )
Overheard from a senior: Gee 
 m stiff this morning; I studied last
night (Tsk tsk tsk) 
Speaking o f seniors we hear the
class play is going to be positively
23 80 this year Wouldn t it be exciting
if something serious would result
from the so far fictitious heart
interests 
In closing may we quote a bit of
verse for your assimilation:
Freshmen are green 
Seniors are gray;
Nothing but green grass
Turned into hay 
Farewell cheerio adieu ta ta n
all that

 SO LONG A G O 
I ll bet some o f you know that
Black River had a school paper 
namely The Breee as far back as
11 years ago 1928 We still have
the Breeze It is now our annual 
but the school paper has a different
name (I m sure you ve all read the
 Oriole )
But I m not supposed to be telling
you about the Oriole It s wellknown 
and I feel safe in saying well
lived in our school 
But let s turn time back to 1928
and talk about The Breeze 
First o f all there was an organization
called The Ink Spots made
up largely of girls The club sponsored
a leap year party this particular
year and the invitations were artistically
printed by hand by Miss Carol
Kinley The party was a gay one 
for every one dressed like a child 
Each guest was to come to the party
in appropriate costume and be prepared
to recite some rhyme o f his or
her childhood A fter the dinner each
 child recited his piece or sang a
song A prize was given to little
Tommy Mills for the best recitation 
even though he broke down and
wept for Mama when he couldn t
remember his lines The best dressed
child little Carol Kinley also carried
off a prize After awarding the
prizes the little folks were allowed
to dance in the spacious hall or the
Junior High building and promptly at
9 o clock all were sent home I think
this sort o f party would go over big 
in our school How about it Mr 
Johnson 
Some other interesting features of
the 1928 Breeze were original poems
written by some o f the students One
poem Lincoln by Norma Bersing 
particularly appealed to me It was
after Lincoln s death 
There was also a short review of
the class play o f that year Mr Sindelar
was included in the cast He
took the parf o f John Sedgwick an
old flame o f Miss Day (Marjorie Overlien) 
Wonder if he still remembers
it 
The Commercial department was
giving typing medals then too And
if a student typed 25 words a minute
for 15 minutes without more than 10
errors he received a proficiency certificate 
Pins or medals were given
the same as they are today 
Jokes were also printed in The
Breeze some o f which are reproduced
in this issue o f the Oriole with
a change o f characters 
Did you know that our High school
printed a monthly magazine called
 The Black River Breeze as far back
as 1909 No I didn t either until
I read the Breeze o f 28 
There were also short articles about
the G A A Girl Scouts and the
Hi Y club 
I thoroughly enjoyed reading the
paper and if I haven t given you
enough information here I m sure
Miss Bailey would let you see for
yourself 
Get in line 
B L A C K R IV E R V S N E ILLSV ILLE
Black River was defeated in what
was by far most exciting and thrilling
game o f the season by Neillsville
in an overtime 28 26 It was a hard
battle from the opening tip off with
both teams fighting for all they were
worth never once did either team
let up 
The two high point men on the
Black River five were Horswill who
tallied 11 points and Olson who made
10 The scoring was pretty much divided
on the Neillsville team but Bremer
with 8 to his credit and Whitte
with 6 led the scoring Neillsville
was at an advantage due to the
height o f their team But neverthe
less Horswill and Upton did some nice
work in regard to getting the rebounds
and captured the ball for
Black River many times 
The first quarter was fast and fu
rious with both teams holding the
other down It ended in a tie 6 6 
In the second period Black River
broke loose and seemed to gain the
upper hand At the half the score
read 14 9 in favor o f Black River 
Neillsville came back the third quarter
to score or bust It again was
a hard fast quarter and Neillsville
managed to lessen Black River s lead
for at the end o f the quarter it was
19 16 in Black River s favor During
the fourth a spurge o f scoring start
ed First one team and then the
other Neillsville at last tied up the
score 23 23 The time was getting
short and the crowd was wild (Olson
then made a push shot and seemingly
clinched the game but Neillsville took
the ball and Bremer broke loose for a
set up It was then 15 seconds to go 
The fourth quarter ended in a
queer situation with a foul called
with V Olson the shooter just as the
whistle blew He missed however 
and thus a 3 minute overtime was necessary 
During the hard battle o f the overtime
Neillsville managed to get a basket
and a free throw and held Black
River down to a free throw It was
a hard game to lose as Black River
had held the lead until almost the
finish and a quick basket by Neillsville
lost the game for them 
All in all this last home game was
a good one between two evenly
matched teams in which both were
out to win

these two bridges represent both ends

A U K E E A L L S T A R S 60 TO 50
In their first game o f basket ball
under the sponsorship o f Bruce Van
Gorden s Texaco Oil Company Merrillan s
caging gentry went on a scoring
rampage against the Milwaukee
College All Stars to win a sparkling 
rapid fire victory before a crowd that
was left gasping at the terrific speed
of the Milwaukee men and the deadly
efficiency and brilliant play o f the
New Texacos Two o f the visitors 
Beland pivot man and a little guy
named Corwin were out and out
good Another geezer entitled John
son might have been good too but the
gent was too durn busy trying to keep
up with Christy He might just as
well have forgotten about Christy 
we still have to see a ball player who
can come close to following the lad 
It s worth real dough to see Christy
when the going is tough and fast 
the guy could win in a race with a
load o f buckshot out o f a melon patch
and Sunday with a team o f college
stars as opposition the big Norsk was
a streak o f light we don t mean to
slight Frost Matalas Nichols Hayden
or Porter they contributed plenty 
but we like the beautiful and that s
what Christy s work was Ketchum
o f Milwaukee later said Nobody
could stop that fellow he s the fast
est big man I ve ever seen 
For Milwaukee the man who looked
best was Belond a well proportioned
giant who handled the leather like
John D used to handle dimes i e 
with the greatest o f facility His
passes were smooth and clever like
Ellison s but unlike Ellison s they
didn t bound off a teammates nose 
An all star was set to receive it when
he let loose and as the 50 points by
the enemy testifies they also caught
the Texacos off balance with this passing
business 
But to the gam e; during the early
portion thereof the city slickers were
completely baffled by the Texaco s
fast break as well as the zone type
o f guarding Thrice the Milwaukee
boys called time to regain composure
as Merrillan drew further and further
away but nux vomique (whatever
that means) our heroies lead by the
rangy Frost and The Cyclone Matalas 
scampered off to a 19 to 7 first
period advantage 
In Act 2 H Porter valet o f bovines
in private life gave the folks a
show o f plain and fancy caging by
bracketing eight tallies in the space
o f four minutes to act as the fireworks
in bringing the oil men up to a
32 to 18 edge for the half 
At rest time the big town collegians
evidently had brewed up a plot
involving dark deeds against Mr Van
Gorden s oil business for when the
whistle signaled the return to action
the bombarding by the enemy started
and the scorekeeps pencil done a Gilda
Grey marking down the counts 
Twenty tallies went thru for the Reds
bringing their total to 38 The Texacos
in the meantime had pushed
their total up 12 to make it 44 to 38 
Came the curtain quarter and more
fireworks with the enemy rapidly
coming up Clifford Lightnin Christianson
went to work and teamed with
Pickles Nichols to bring Merrillan out
o f danger they took turns with fielders
by Hayden and Matalas made the
Merrillan Texacos count an even 60 
Beland Corwin and Werner added a
dozen for Milwaukee to bring their
score to 50 so the barrage ended 60
to 50 
Having thus sunk one great opponent
the Texacos are now preparing
themselves for another on March 23
the famous Globe Trotters will try
out their wares against the fast traveling
Merrillanites This will be the
biggest basket ball treat o f the year 
and the finale to the Texaco s season
at home The biggest crowd in
years will be on hand to see the colored
stare We hope to see what a
black man looks like when he blushes

PO ETRY CORNER
Flu when it strikes you is a horrible
thing 
It makes your throat sore and makes
your head ring 
You get the chills your feet are cold 
It makes you feel weak and sort o f
old 
You miss all the fun your mother
gets mad 
And scolds and frets as tho you had
The measles or something else as bad 
know because I ve had it too 
But be thankful that it s just the flu

for folks who like action in their
travels 
It had eight eager cylinders in a mighty
Dynaflash engine and they could
make a scared jack rabbit eat dust
w henever the wrord was given 
It had a ride we promptly dubbed
 full float that s how soft its stout
coiled springs are in action 
It had a view from windows and
windshields as much as 412 square
inches bigger and it had style that has
already altered the pattern on many
another car stylist s drawing board 
So we looked it all over and went a
step further W e decided a car so
plainly meant for action
needed to have a price
that would get action for it

The bill for reorganization o f the
executive and independent departments
is again up for consideration 
ft is considerably changed from the
Theasure proposed last session but the
issue o f congressional control still is
there Some 19 years have elapsed
since the issue arose in the Harding
administration and it has been before
almost every Congress since A
law was passed in the closing days
o f the Hoover administration Although
President Hoover had demanded
the law he made no use of
kt The powers o f the law were extended
into this administration when
it came in but they were permitted
to lapse without action In the
last session a new bill was defeated
by a narrow vote 
The present measure has been
drawn to eliminate some o f the opposition
o f a year ago In that direction 
it provides that at least 16
boards and commissions shall not be
included in the re organization This
probably will result in less inter department
opposition to the bill and
also less opposition o f some o f the
large group organizations which helped
stir up sentiment against the proposal
when the former bill was under
consideration While from the press
the impression might be gained that
the matter is a fight between the
President and Congress that is only
partly the case Striking out so many
boards and commissions from the
jurisdiction o f the measure is a concession 
that the contest involves a
division o f sentiment within administration
circles 
M E CHURCH GAINS IN
SU ND AY SCHOOL 
A gain o f eight in average attendance
at the Sunday Church School of
the Black River Falls Methodist Episcopal
church has been achieved in recent
months The Rev H A Allison
is pastor and Mrs A H Trask is
acting superintendent 
The local church is participating in
the Church School Advance which has
brought gains in attendance in Methodist
Sunday schools all over the nation 
according to word received by
the pastor from the Board o f Education
o f his denomination in Chicago 
The northern branch o f Methodism
has achieved a gain in average Sunday
school attendance o f 25 411 in
less than a year In the southern
branch o f the communion the gains
are approximately 1 0 0 0 0 0 
The Church School Advance proceeds
by three very simple principles
 Hold the pupils you now have 
gain new pupils by a better understanding
o f the community and its
needs and improve the school by the
training o f lay leaders 
W O M A N S CLUB
The year 1939 will be a record
breaking year in the construction of
new war vessels At the present rate
( f progress 73 new naval vessels will
be launched this year They will
range from battleships o f 40 000
tons the cost o f each o f which will
be $70 000 000 or more down to
the submarines torpedo boats and
other smaller vessels This addition
to the Navy will make it second to
no other nation in the number o f
warships and possibly excelled only
by that o f Great Britain in the way
o f tonnage That record may not be
held long as Great Britain has a
building program even more extensive
than our own Next year and
for the ensuing three or four years 
naval expansion will continue upon
even a larger scale; particularly in
the way o f battleships and large
cruisers Millions more will be spent
upon the additional thousands o f airplanes 
An attempt will be made to obtain
an investigation o f illegal alien immigration
into this country The subject
is not new but disclosures in
recent months would seem to indicate
that the number o f aliens coming by
stealth and conspiracy may be equal
if not larger than those who come
legally and with proper visas under
our immigration laws The same investigation
if authorized may ascertain
the reason for the great decline
in the deportation o f aliens who have
come here surreptitiously That number
has dropped from 37 000 deportations
annually to about 8 000 It is
known that the number who have
come here contrary to law and remained
notwithstanding the law runs
into hundreds o f thousands The Immigration
Department has lacked
funds to make much headway in the
matter 
The scandal arising from the smuggling
in and wrongful entrance o f
aliens has been growing in the larger
seaport cities and the recent orders
forbidding employment o f aliens on
WPA are aiding ir forcing attention
to the problem Among the most insistent
violations o f the law are said
to be those o f large ship lines on the
Atlantic which are said to profit
handsomely through the traffic Ships
which carry a crew o f 700 on the
outward voyage are charged with employing
900 or more on their return 
Once in the country by such methods 
the aliens are safe until they can be
rounded up by federal agents and
taken into court By the time an
order o f deportation has been issued
in a single case dozens o f newcomers
arrive by the same method It is
charged that some lines have a regular
charge o f from $50 to $100 each
for thus aiding men from foreign
countries to come to our ports There
are o f course other agencies engaged
in the illegal traffic and boats
coming from Cuba and other Carribean
islands are frequently captured
with from a dozen to 1 0 0 aliens on
board The huge profits o f such a
voyage make alien smuggling a regular
business which the government
finds difficult to stamp out 
When the Economy Act was passed 
several years ago a few millions
were stricken out o f the appropriation
for border guards on the borders
between our country and Canada and
Mexico The smugglers who had formerly
found fortunes in running in
foreign booze were not slow in taking
advantage o f the new opportunity 
In a single night they are able
to transport aliens from the bordering
country to one o f our large
cities and the fares are said to be
many times the rates paid by others
on Pullman cars How many thousands
o f aliens who are being discharged
from W PA came in by either
the sea or the land routes is not
known 
This illegal flow o f aliens makes
uncertain the exact status o f immigration
under our laws Those who
come from abroad honestly and openly
upon visas issued by our consular
service abroad are less numerous than
for years From 1931 to 1938 there
were 4 260 081 who came mainly
from Europe In that same period 
aside from those deported by the government 
4 487 085 returned to their
native lands over seas Last year the
number departing was 50 000 more
than those who came in The situation
in Europe and the possibility o f
war between some countries now is
increasing the number o f applicants
for visas The quota o f visas permissible
annually for Germany is about
27 000 but applications have been
filed by ten times that number 
At their meeting held Wednesday 
Feb 8 in the hotel the members of
the Woman s club were privileged to
hear Mrs A L Murray o f Eau
Claire who spoke on the Social
Value o f Motion Pictures Mrs 
Murray took a course in that subject
at the University o f Southern
California last summer In connection
with her work at the University
Mrs Murray was able to visit various
moving picture studios and had
interesting experiences to relate 
Among others it was her privilege to
attend a showing o f a picture given
to a board o f women before it was
released to the public She was also
in attendance at the premiere of
 Marie Antoinette and told how the
people stood outside the theatre to
see the actors and actresses as they
arrived 
A group o f members had dinner
with Mrs Murray preceding the
meeting She had spoken at the school
in the afternoon after which she was
entertained at a tea given in her
honor by Mrs P M Chaimson 
The Craft department o f the W oman s
club met Tuesday March 7th
at the home o f Mrs Wm Schunke 
with Mrs Ed Heineck as assistant
hostess Mrs A W Heilsberg and
Mrs O E Wang presented a demonstration
on sewing hints and dressmaking
which proved to be a practical
benefit to the entire group Mrs 
Heilsberg had planned the program
in such a way that every one could
participate in the demonstration 
There were twenty in attendance

 Today is a fine day 
Learn to talk Winnebago Indian
language by following this column
each week Why not The whites
have taught us Redskins their language
so turn about is fair play 
Every white reader should talk to
some extent the Indian language o f
their community not that it will get
you anywhere in the world but merely
for the fun o f it The English
language is not my mother tongue 
so 1 have lots o f fun juggling the
English words and arranging them in
such a way that it sounds like something 
John Marsh our recent retired bus
iness man talks very good Indian and
knows the meaning o f many Indian
names for different kinds o f dry
goods Pale face Carish o f the
I G A store talks fairly good Indian
too But when it comes to talking
the Winnebago language the late
Werner brothers Art and Bob of
this city were way above the average 
And then there were and are many
great friends o f the Winnebagoes
who do not speak a word o f Indian 
Take the late surgeon and physician 
Eugene Krohn and Judge Frank
Johnson for examples It is quite
probable these true friends o f the
Redmen never had the leisure tome to
learn Now there are County Judge
Harry Perry and Mr Berg o f the
jewelry store and many others who
do not talk one word o f Indian except
to say How Next week we ll have
the first part o f Scout law o f the
Boy Scouts in Winnebago language 
Some time in the latter part of
January the Wisconsin Winnebago
Claim committee o f which the writer
is president received a letter from
their tribal attorney in Washington 
stating that Senator Bob La Follette
had introduced the Winnebago
Jurisdictional bill on the 16th o f that
month in Congress This bill if it
passes Congress will open the doors
o f the Court o f Claims to the Winnebago
tribe that they may present
what claims they may have against
the U S Government Proving
claims against Uncle Sam is what we
would call a task colossal This Winnebago
claim committee representing
the Winnebago tribe o f Wisconsin is
represented in Washington by the
tribal attorney Ralph H C ase The
committee is also working in conjunction
with the state s attorney
general s office A law was passed
about four years ago in the state
legislature conferring on the state the
authority to secure or work out some
means o f securing satisfactory recompense
for the Indians o f Wisconsin
from the U S government for
long neglected benefits from unfulfilled
treaties 
Providing that this jurisdictional
bill introduced in Congress by Senator
La Follette should pass and the
Winnebagoes receive a favorable decision
from the Court o f Claims and
the Indians receive satisfactory adjustments
from Uncle Sam the state
will have benefitted by having the living
standards Of its Indians greatly
lifted and will have benefitted largely
also from the monetary viewpoint

 Well done thou good and faithful
servant Enter thou into the joy o f
the Lord How fitting these words
to the life o f Mr Fowler a much
loved and respected citizen o f our
community Good and faithful Not
only was he a good man but a good
Christian man How much like the
Master when we can say o f him he
went about doing good Always ready
to go the second mile to do a bit
more than was required o f him always
ready and willing to be o f service
to all When a neighbor or
friend was sick or in trouble he was
the first to be there to encourage
and cheer bringing in a basket of
good things or flowers 
He had expressed the wish that
when his time came to go he might
just say good night here and awake
and say good morning Over There 
and so it was He retired at night as
usual bidding his family good night 
and while he was sleeping a Presence
came awakened him gently and
said Come and his spirit departed 
While our hearts were saddened
how great must have been his joy as
he met his Master Whom he faithfully
served all his life and saw
again the faces o f his loved ones and
friends who had gone on before 
Faithful For 24 years he had
charge o f the O N lumber yard
here and when he retired in 1926 he
received a fine testimonial from the
owners o f the yard for many years
o f faithful service He was a faithful
member o f the Masonic lodge and
served as treasurer for many years 
Always interested in the community
he served several years as clerk of
the school board 
For the major portion o f his long
and useful life he was a devoted and
faithful member o f the Methodist
church serving as Sunday school superintendent
for many years and also
as treasurer which office he held at
the time o f his death Here again
he evidenced his faithfulness looking
after all the little details that the
less thoughtful forget The most outstanding
evidence o f his faithfulness
was shown by the loyalty o f his
church attendance Altho for the last
two or three years he could not hear
any o f the sermon on account o f impaired
hearing every Sunday morning
found him in his place at the
church service 
His life is an inspiration and a
challenge to all who knew him and to
have known him was to love him 
May his picture never fade from memory s
wall Truly he was Thy servant
and how precious in the sight
o f the Lord is the death o f His
saints We cannot say that he is
dead Spirits like his do not die He
is still with us in fellowship in purpose
and in spirit He is not dead 
just a little farther on

Like the ivy that seems to embrace
the tree in its affection but in its
affection it is really choking and
killing it; so the cares o f this life
together with sin are in reality detrimental
and in its final state produces
death Put God first in your life as
a safe guard against these things We
invite you to the House o f God
