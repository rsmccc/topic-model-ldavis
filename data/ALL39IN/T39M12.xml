    b y s t e m R e v a m p e d b y Benito M ussolini's conviction th at j
    highly developed com m unicatioes are indispensable in tim e of peace nr w
    ar has spurred Italian engineers to p rep are for either eventuality by
    budding m achinery and technical equipm ent probably unm atched by any other
    nation. Italian engineering genius has given to Italy the world’s fastest
    electric locomotives and the m ost powerful radio shortw ave station in
    existence, and is engaged in plans for laying down a telephone cable between
    Sicily and A frica which will be the world’s la rg e s t Over a netw ork of
    4,000 m iles of trackthe larg est netw ork of electric railw ay yet built by
    any nation Italian locom otives pull passenger train s at speeds varying
    between 60 and 100 m iles an hour. On a test run between N aples and Rome
    recently a a electrically powered passenger train averaged 103 m iles an
    hour, attaining a top speed of 125 m iles. When these electric behem oths
    whiz through the quiet Italian countryside w atchm en close the gates a t
    road crossings five m inutes before the train is due lest any p easan t with
    his horsedraw n c a rt be caught on the track. E lectricity, generated from
    Italy ’s only m ajo r n atu ral resourcew ater poweris gradually com ing to
    be the m ost used fuel in Ita ly ’s tra n sportation system . Italy’s first
    subway train, which will tran sp o rt 92, 000 passengers an h oar to the
    site of Hum e’s 1942 World’s fair, will be operated by electricity. Already
    alm ost a third of the cap ital’s busses are electrically run. Mussolini’s
    prophecy th at Italy j destiny “ alw ays has been and ali w ays will be on
    the se a," has been anticipated by the construction of a m erchant m arine
    the equal of any possessed by the great nations of ihe world. Twentyfive new
    m otor ships to engage in world trade, each capable of cruising speeds of 16
    knots, are being built in Italian ship . yards. W O O D L I F F ’S

    Q N EW O C R E N D E R IN G By WILLIAM SMITH (A s s o c ia te d N e w s p a
    p e rs .) VVNU Seivice. V f RS. MILL w as a good and rath ^ e r p retty
    little widow. H er five children adored h er and usually obeyed her, which
    is significant. She had never sm iled m errily since the day her husband
    died, finely ftghting the wr.rst blaze th at had ev er occurred in the
    history of peaceful Da nns ville. Dora Mill w as d ressm ak er and a good
    one. though if she h ad n 't been quite clever with her garden as wed, m
    aking it support the hungry five and supply early peas to som e of the
    neighbors, it was hard to see how she could m ake ends m eet. H er attractiv
    e face and pleasant m an n er had called forth a t least one ofTer of m
    arriag e, but she dreaded the effect of a stepfather on the affairs of the
    five, which she w as c a pably directing to certain definite ends. D errick
    was to be an electrical engineer. He knew, of course, th a t this m eant im
    m ense effort on his own part, for D ora never disguised th a t trium ph m
    eant work. F anny w as to be a designer. Tom was too sm all to be seriously
    inclined tow ard any calling, and the tw ins w ere m ere babies. T herefore
    when G erard Fdey, owner of the Filey Iron Works, drove up to the tiny house
    and asked for D ora, she w as surprised and just a little frightened. Tom
    would throw balls. Possibly his ball had broken a sizeable window. But no. “
    You are Mrs. Mill’ asked Filey. “ I a m .” replied D ora, "won’t you com e
    inM “ If I m ay, I will, said the stran g er. “I came, said Filey, com ing
    directly to the p o in t “to tell you th a t your husband saved m y life.
    Possibly you did not know of it.’ Mrs. Mill flushed painfully. “ I think Tom
    did his dutyalw ays.” she said, quietly. F iley looked at her. What a lovely
    little face it was. How refined in expression. “ I w asn’t thinking of any m
    aterial expression of g ratitu d e ,” he h astened to explain, T only
    thought perh ap s we m ight m ight be fn en d s. 1 lost a son, you know. F
    ra t house burned. M aybe you h e a rd of i t And m y wife slipped, clim
    bing in Sw itzerland. I’m alone, don’t you see And I ’m very sorry fo r
    folks who a re alone. T h at’s all. Then, I know Dr. Bigby who judged yo u r
    babies. And I sm p articularly in terested in b etter b abies.” It w as all
    la id so sim ply th at D ora could not take offense or suspect ulterio r m
    otives. “ If you a re unbappy,” said she w ith the sam e ftne frankness. “ I
    sball be glad to help you if I can. I am not v ery well educated. I’ve never
    been fu rth er aw ay than St. Louis in m y life. But I w ant the b est of
    life for all m y little ones. And I am glad they’re bealthy and food. Do you
    know.” with half a sm ile, “i w as afraid little T oA m ight h av e broken
    one of your w indow s/’ Filey sm iled, too “ No/ he said. “ ML wa$ ¿us% th a
    t t couldn't B R A N D A U T H E A U C T IO N E E R W ilton, W is. Th man
    who gets you the hiçh dollar. CITY COUNCIL PROCEEDINGS any longer to tell
    you th at m y thoughts w ere with you. Have been since I heard about it. T h
    at’s a lt I ’H be m ighty grateful if you’ll let th e kiddies com e around
    som e tim e and play. It doesn’t m a tte r if a ball or so goes a s tra y
    once in a while. I ’m lonely. I w onder,” hesitatingly, “ if you‘d ev er let
    me take you out in m y c a r for a rid e.” D ora knew F iiry was rated at
    over half a m illion, but she understood his need. “If it helps you any, of
    course I will. And I’d enjoy the rides. I m ay bring the twins, of course”
    ”Couldn’t do without ’em ,” said Filey. And a strange and ra th e r
    beautiful friendship grew between these two sim ple souls. D ora never seem
    ed to recognize the b a rrie r of money. She was too genuinely
    unsophisticated. To her he w as ju st the m an her Tom had saved. Filey had
    m et for the first tim e in his life a w om an who thought all the tim e of
    others as if it w ere the m ost n a tu ra l thing to do. B ut he noted the
    drives brought a p retty color to h e r cheeks and th at the twins grew to
    hug him as if he belonged, som ehow, in the sim ple schem e of their lives.
    At last he asked Dora if she thought she could ever learn to care for him a
    little. “N ot,” m odestly, •‘as you cared forTom. B ut if you'd le t m e tak
    e c a re of you. I’m so d a m fond of the kids.” F o r the first tim e the
    difference in social position daw ned on Dora. T m only a firem an’s widow,”
    she said. ” My fath er w as forem an a t the iron w orks,” he said. ‘he wos
    an inventor and th a t’s how he m ade his money. A fter all. we’re A m
    ericans and I do n 't think it m a tte rs . . . C a n 't you like m e ju st
    a little ” he coaxed. “I love you, D ora.” T can ’t give you w hat I gave
    Tom .” w hispered Dora, “but I re spect you with all m y h e a r t and 1
    love you for your goodness to us all.” ” 1 guess I ’ll have to be satisfied
    with that, then. M ajbe. in the years to com e you m ay grow to like m e a
    little b etter.” He sm iled half wistfully. as he took her into his arm s. S

    Alp» Work lias been completed on the new French National observatory,
    located in Provence, which is declared to be the largest in Europe and
    second in size only to Mount Wilson observatory in California. For more than
    a decade, a committee of French astronomers and physicists had been seeking
    an appropriate site to build this observatory Forcalquier was chosen because
    of its altitude, because of the unusual clarity of the atmosphere and
    because of the excellent weather which the region enjoys virtually every day
    of the year. The French scientists who supervised its construction say it
    will be the "most favored observatory in the world’’ because 250 observation
    mghts will be available every year. Three years were required to build the
    new observstory. Its equipment is as modern as science and money can make it
    Its 80^inch reflecting telescope is the largest in Europe and ranks third In
    sise in the world. The observatory cost $10,000,000. tttlijTMtlf Ga» Ptimp A

    MORRISON Bees Travel Far fer Nectar Curious to learn wbtre the honey bees,

    obtained nectar for their winter supply if honey, the acting custodisn made
    a field trip, notebook and pocket lens in hand. No sources of nectar seemed
    to ex is t The landscape, characteristically desert and arid st all seasons,
    under autumn's influence showed only dry end withered plsnts and rattling
    seed pods. Through the sparse cover could be seen the varicolored clays and
    bright hues of the soil. Yet In all directions bees were hovering. The
    custodian produced hit lens and knelt upon the ground. Then the secret was
    revealed. Beneath his feet no less than seven different species of plants
    were coming Into hill ftower. The blossoms were so minute, however, that
    they could be seen only through a high powered pocket magnifier. Fame af
    Lourdes The fame of Lourdes dates from 1858, when the Virgin appeared to a
    young girl, Bernadette Soubirous. The grotto near w^hich the apparition took
    place is now surmounted by the magnificent Church of the Rosary, containing
    a shrine to Our Lady of Lourdes. The church contains numerous crutches,
    tablets and gifts, which memorialize cures credited to the Virgin. A nearby
    spring which miraculously appeared at tho time of the apparition is diverted

    ‘Archer’ Fi»h . Is Skilled Marksman In the w aters som ew here east of Suez
    Uves a “ shooting fish” that can give naval gunners a lesson or two when it
    comes to marksmanship. This strange creature known as the “ arch er fish/
    lives largely on insects which it shoots from overhanging branches with
    bullet» of water. E ven cigarettes have been extinguished by these marine
    sharpshooters, according to Hugh M. Smith, form er F ish eries adviser to
    the Kingdom of Siam. During his stay in the E a st Mr. Sm ith studied these
    fish in the Philippines, French Indoch in a, Siam , Malaya, B urm a and
    India. “ Wild fish planted in a larg e pond in the compound of m y residence
    in Bangkok w ere under close observation for a num ber of y e a rs,” w rites
    Mr. Smith in N atural History. “Of the oriental freshw ater fishes with
    which I am acquainted in the wild state, none gives auch an im pression ot
    intelligence and efficiency as does Toxotes (the arch er fish). This
    impression grows on an observer as he notes the purposeful way in which a
    fish m oves about in a stream , canal or pond; the zeal and tlioroughness
    with which it exp i r e s aquatic and overhanging land plants for insects,
    the high developm ent of its sense of sight in both a ir and w ater, the
    skill displayed in dislodging insects and seizing them as they fall into the
    w ater, the alertness in avoiding danger and the readiness m adapting itself
    to life in sm all ponds and responding to the attentions of persons who
    provide food. “ A friend of mine, a distinguished scion of the royal famüy
    of Siam and an ardent student of Ashes, had a residence on the broad M enam
    Chao Phya above Bangkok and used to entertain A m erican and E uropean
    guests with shootingfish p e rform ances. A v eranda on which he took m any
    of his m eals was directly over the w ater, and under it Toxotes could be
    found almost dafty, a ttra c ted by scraps of fish, meat, chicken and praw n
    which were regularly thrown from the table. Friday and Saturday Specials Hum

    Yale University Started By Harvard Graduates The first movement leading to
    the establishm ent of what is now Yale university was a meeting of W m
    inisters at Branford, Coon. Nine of these minister» were graduates of H
    arvard and therefore it may be said with some truth that Yale w as founded
    by Harvard men. They contributed 40 volumes for the lib rary of the proposed
    college. An act of incorporation creating a body of trustees was passed by
    the Connecticut legislature in 1701. The college was originally a t Saybrook
    and rem oved to New Haven later. It was not at first called Yale, th a t nam
    e be inc. given to 1L In. recognition o f ¿ donation m ade by Yale, a
    childless London m erchant, whose fath er had been one of the original
    settlers a t New Haven. Cotton M ather, a H arvard m an, and one of the m
    ost fam ous of all the P uritans, m ay be said to have nam ed Yale. A letter
    which he wrote to Elihu Yale says in part: “ If w hat is form ing a t New
    Haven m ight b ear the nam e of Yale college it would be b etter than a nam
    e of sons and daughters. And your m unificence m ight easily obtain for you
    such com m em oration.’ Coyote Eating: Habits The coyo»e, usually considered
    an enem y of farm ers and wildlife, is really not as villainous an anim al
    as m ost people think, according to a report from the National Wildlife
    federation. In a recent investigation on eoyote’s diet, mice, grasshoppers,
    beetles, grubs, angleworms, blueberries, apples, roots and herbs were found
    to be the chief item s on Ms m enu. O ccasionally the oyete m ay dine off
    the ca rc a ss ol anim als killed by som e j other agency. Although m any ¡
    sheep and deer kills are attributed , to coyotes, these deaths are just as j
    likely to be due to stray dogs, says H erb ert Lenon, a trap p er in stru
    ctor, with y ears of experience with these anim als. Oahu, Tiny Pacific UI,
    Has U. S. Military Value Modern m ilitary history has a strange chapter for
    the , almost primitive, northwestern shore line of Oahu, now considered the
    United States outfltrag barrier ag ainst any attack upon the mainland.
    Almost untouched by the modernity of Honolulu, SO m iles distant, the people
    of this strategic military tangent are peaceful fishermen and sm all farm
    ers. They Include virtually all of H aw aii's varied races. The m ilita ry
    important “north hore’ lies on the windward side of t v island, a low
    coralsand shore line. S' »netimes bitterly lashed by hr¿\vy seas. To the
    westward, the extrem e tip of the island. K aena Point, is a blunt green .
    Schofield barracks, the country's largest m ilita ry post, is located a few
    m iles inland. M ilitary officials decline to specify the sections of the
    island considered m ost vulnerable to invasion, but the proxim ity of
    Schofield barracks and the location of tactical exercises indicate the im
    portance of the “north shore. O ther low sections of the island, som e
    virtually uninhabited, were sim ilarly “protected” by mobilized troops
    during w ar gam es. The “north shore fronts steam er and airship lanes to
    the Orient. Itc residents, including many ot Oriental descent, long have
    been accustom ed to m ili ti y activity. Manen» vers send troops near their
    house» and field pieces are planted near by. Haw aiian fishermen, some using
    band nets and spears, fish Inside the reef, whieb parallels the shoreline a
    few m iles seaw ard. Japanese sam pans are anchored in a seawater inlet,
    which resembles a rustic stream . Many residents oi this a rea are employed
    by one of the islands larg est sugar plantations, living in their own com m
    unity and visiting Honolulu only infrequently. School children go barefooted
    th e y ear around. D espite the im portance placed upon it by m odem m
    ilitary observers. the “north shore' traditionally has been one of the most
    peaceful sections of the islands. It seldom knew the bloody intertribal
    warfare of H aw aii’s early history. BATTERIES RECHARGED Borax in Death
    Valley The borax deposits of Death valley, 300 feet below sea level in C
    alifornia. w ere found only about 60 years ago by one Aaron Winters and his
    wife. Rosie, who lived in another valley nearby, 200 m iles distan t from
    the nearest inhabited settlem ent. T aking his wife along, W inters traveled
    400 m iles to obtain chem icals for prospecting D eath valley borax. A month
    later he found one of the largest borax deposits in the world in the valley,
    and sold his claim for 5,000 pounds. ONIONS La.r.g.e. s.iz.e.. ........ i °

    the M oocher Minnie the Moocher is the most fam ous deer in the wood of
    Wisconsin, says the National Wildlife federation. After a poacher had killed
    her m other, Minnie was rescued from starvation by a game warden and brought
    to the cabm of Walter Sebastian, caretaker at warden h eadquarters near
    Argonne. In flytime, Minnie sleeps in the cabin, on a bed preferably. She
    helps herself to all sorts of groceries. She has raised fawns of her own
    every year, and now, at the age of nine, is the m other of triplets. Her
    offspring are also a bit too tame for the com fort and convenience of the w
    ardens. helping them selves to everything a ór.er likes, from cigarettes to
    pfcocakes. HUNT FKNSKE HOM EM ADE CHRISTMAS C A N D lfcS Made w ith pure cam

    d o n Continent I The ñrst E n f¿ s h boo'c ever prir.t I ed was not printed
    in England, but j som ew here on the Continent, about 11474, according to
    the M ontreal H erald. William Caxton, a Kentish born apprentice to a rich
    London cloth m erchant, went to Bruges, to work at his trade. Caxton becam e
    a prom inent m an, educated him self, and translated from F rench into
    English a book of stories called ' Recuycll of the Histories of T roy.” (“
    Recuyell" ieans collection). The duchess of B urgundy, who was an Englishwom
    an, liked it so m uch, and so m any ether people wished to read it th at he
    soon tired of m aking handw ritten copies. and decided to learn the new and
    wonderful a rt of printing. This was the first bock he prim ed. The first
    book known to be printed in England was, ”The D ictes and Sayings of the
    Philosophers.”’ It was tran slated from the F rench by E arl Rivers, revised
    and printed by Caxton who added a chapter and a prologue. He had set up the
    first E nglish printing press not far from the west door of W estm inster
    Abbey, in a house known as the House of the Red Pale, from the sign which he
    se t over it. From his house Caxton sent out the first printed advertisem
    ents known in Englund, “If it ÿieast any men spiritual or te m p o ra l/’ he
    says, to buy a certain book, “ let him come to W estm inster in to the
    Almonry at the Red Pale, and he shall have them good cheap. The ad v ertisem
    ent, which is given in “ M arshall's History of E nglish L iteratu re,’
    ended with som e L atin words which m ay be translated, “ Please do not pull
    down the advertisem ent.' R e n o O u tlin e s Program F o r A n o t h e r B
    o o m E r a After having its ups and downs since the ‘ Big Boom of 1931,
    Reno seem s to be heading for palm y days which m any residents believe will
    rival the period when gam bling was legal. The city, known principally as a
    divorce center, is on the verge of another “jackpot” from two sources, one
    of which is purely accidental j and the other planned, j 1. The California
    legislature has ‘ enacted a law requiring prospective j brides and
    bridegroom s to undergo j physical exam inations before obtarnj ing a m
    arrieg e license. R eno's m arj riage business already is a substan \ tial
    addition to the city ’s com m erce I and it was believed the honeymoonj ers
    from C alifornia would triple : when the law gaes into effect about ! Septem
    ber 20. 2. A real estate syndicate is publishing a booklet, with

    m ail order 25 years ago was a shotgun. W hat he got was a wife. Trouble w
    as Bachum wrote two letters, one to his sw eetheart, the other to a Chicago
    firm, ordering a shotgun. He put them in the wrong envelopes. His sw
    eetheart got the order for a shotgun, the Chicago m ail order house got his
    biiiel doux, w here a girl clerk read it, sta rted a correspondence that
    ended in m atrim ony. But it turned out happily. While Baehum never got his
    shotgun, he blissfully celebrated his silver wedding anniversary recently on
    a farm near W eatherford, Okla. Opossum Hunt Mrs. M ark Henderson. 60, who
    lives on an Illinois farm , heard a hen squall as she went out to put up her

    house. Mrs. H enderson obtained a rifle, cam e back to the barn and found

    Interstellar Collisions Cause Atom 4Showersf A Nobel prixe w inner reports
    that the collision of in terstellar energy “bullets" and w andering atom s
    in the outer atm osphere is constantly show ering the e a rth ’s surface
    with electrically charged p articles known as m esotrons. Some of the m
    esotrons, so called because they are about m idw ay in weight between an
    electron and the nucleus of an atom , disintegrate before they reach the
    ground, but ethers have been recorded in m ines several hundred feet deep. A
    rep o rt on form ation of the m iddlew eight p articles was m ade at a m
    eeting of the A m erican Philosophical society by Dr. A rthur H. Com pton, U
    niversity of Chicago physicist. T ests have shown, Dr. Compton said, that
    form ation of the m esotrons increases with altitude. P roduction is alm ost
    nonexistent at elevations below 14,000 feet. With re c o r d ir devices
    carrie d aloft by airplane, it was found th a t production becom es readily
    discernible a t 20,000 feet and becom es abundant a t 23,000 f e e t The
    energy bullets whose collision with atom s produce the m esotrons a re cosm
    ic rays, on the nature of which physicists still a re divided. Ju s t w hat
    occurs when the m esotrons d isintegrate has not been determ ined, but Dr.
    Compton believes that they divide into ordinary electrons and neutrinos, the
    la tte r being d escribed as l‘ghtweight neutrons. NEW ITEMS \rriving Daily

    Soperier Flyers Aviation experts readily admit that aviation has outstripped
    the birds in only one respectspeed. Since the earliest days of m an’s flying
    he has attained far greater speed in the air than even the fastest of birds.
    Birds seem to know more about winds than man. They will not fly Into a head
    wind for any great distance, but wait for a tail wind before starting a
    migration. How they know when to start has not been learned, but they scern
    able to Ume their long Sights to coincide with the prevailing winds. A bird
    can change his angle of Incidence and an airplane has ihe angle of incidence
    built into i t A bird can also change his wing area in flight, which is
    something man has been unable to do in a plane. ENTERTAINS AT WEDDING DINNER

    Sweaters Sl.OO 77c Roe Has Long Figured In History of England The rose, in
    all probability, has figured m ore prom inently in the history of E ngland
    than in that of any other country. The War of Roses, which lasted from 1455
    to 14.V was between the House of York end L ancaster. A red rose was the
    badge of Edmund, earl of L ancaster, brother of King E dw ard I. The h ite
    rose was the badge of the Black Prince. According to tradition Som erset
    plucked a red rose in the Tem ple garden, saying. ‘I>et all the friends of L
    ancaster follow in my exam ple. Likewise. Warwick, the friend of York,
    plucked a white ruse, saying. “L et all the friends of York w ear à white
    rose for their badge.' R ibbons and rosettes of red and white were worn by
    the p artisans of L ancaster and York, Another conflict in which the rose as
    worn was the Seven Y ears war. During the B attle of Mmden in 1759, several
    British regim ents gathered and wore roses which flourished on the
    countryside, it is related in G a rden D igest It is a custom fur re maining
    B ritish regim ents to celebrate the battle in which their p redecessors
    fought, by w earing yellow roses and bedecking their drum s and colors. The
    L ancashire F usiliers m ake even m ore of a cercm ony of it. by giving a “
    silent to ast” to those who fell. Most peculiar of all is the ritual which
    follows the toast. The m ost recently joined subalterns m ust stand upon
    their chairs and eat a rose. ‘As Days Grow Longer Cold Grows Stronger’
    According to an old proverb. ‘As the days grow longer, the cold grows stro n
    g er.” After D ecem ber 21 the days lengthen and the sun, which has been
    seen farthest south, appears farth er north each day. T here are several
    reasons why our coldest w eather usually com es after this. The ground
    continues for m any weeks to give out m ore heat than it receives from the
    sun. As snow increases in depth on the e arth ’s surface it becom es colder
    at the surface and cools off the air. The F a r North, during its long
    winter night receiving nn heat d ira tly from the sun, cools off the air
    above it, and this accum ulated cold air overflows into m ore southerly re
    gions. A few days after Decem ber 21. or to be m ore exact, on Ja n u ary 2.
    the earth receives the m ost heat from the sun for we are then neare ft to
    it, only 91.340,000 m iles away, as com pared to 94,450.000 miles in July,
    The N orthern hem isphere doe not, however, get the fuil advantage of this
    greater intensity of the sun in Jan u ary , for winter days are áhort and
    the sun’s rays slant greatly. When there is snow on the ground, the sunshine
    we do get is largely lost by reflection, and the heat th at is absorbed is
    used up. in melting and evaporating the snow. Tin (#)n Industry The “tin ”
    can, in which so much of our f>od com es today, is m ade of thin sheet
    steel, coated with tin; and the A m erican canning industry has grown to
    such proportions that it now uses m ore steel than every other industry
    except autom obile m anufacture, taking a g reater tonnage even than the com
    bined railroads of the country or the nation’s building requirem ents, A m
    erican can producers now m ake m ore than 12,000,000,000 containers
    annually, 60 per cent of which are used for the canning of food and 40 per
    cent as containers for tobacco, paint, oil and other com m odities. Laid end
    to end and side by side, this num ber of cans would cover an 80foot highway
    from New York to San F ra n cisco. Jinx of Kohinoor Even the British royal
    fam ily observes a superstition about twe Kohi noor diam ond, one of the m
    ost famous of the crown jewels. The stone may be worn by a queen but never
    by a king. According to a superstition, any king who w ears the .»arel will
    lose the rule of India, ju st as past m ale owners of the Kohinoor lost
    their dominion over th at realm . In accordance with this belief, r ay Queen
    Victoria. Queen A lexandra. Queen M ary and Queen E lizabeth have ever used
    the stone, which w eighi 106 carats. L ively Heath Valley C ontrary to
    general opinion. Deaih valley has a large variety of wild life, but it is m
    ostly .f the nocturnal or very elusive type seen by tourists. Lizards and
    horned toads abound the chuckawalla. gecko and gridirontailed lizards scoot
    under cover at the ap I proach of m an. At tw ihght, coyotes, j kit foxes
    and ra ts of all sizes and j shapes mQve quietly through the j Tiesquite and
    cactus. S T O R E rs1 ! I 1 !; IS When you are Christinas Shopping See our

    and then Miss G raham asked M ary to sit down and have a little chat. Miss G
    raham asked M ary how she liked h er work. M ary said she liked to teach,
    though she w as doing it to m ake a living. T11 give you a piece of advice,”
    said M iss G raham , who was 50. "Snap cu t of it as soon as you can. Once
    the system gets you it will be h ard to get o u t You’ll put off the idea of
    m arria g e because every y ear you'll look forw ard to a little m ore money
    the n e x t Then you’ll begin to count the y ears to your re tire m ent w
    ith a nice annuity the re st of your life. Now m y advice to you is to m a
    rry your best young m an soon before you get obsessed with this idea of
    yearly increase and eventually retirem en t." ‘ But suppose I h av en 't a
    young m an ,” said M ary sm iling. “ M arry the first m an th at asks
    youproviding h e’s d e c e n t Don t w ait for a m an who can guarantee a
    yearly increase and an annuity in your old age.M ‘T il rem em b er w hat you
    have said,” said M ary with a little blush, and would have said m ore but
    Miss G raham interrupted. “ Don’t go away." the principal was calling good
    naturedlythen in an aside to M ary“T here’s poor Mr. M endham scared off
    because yo u 're here. Somehow m ^n teach ers never seem like real m en.”
    Then raising h e r voice: “Come rig h t in M r. M endham , I w’an t to show
    you the new rep o rt card s.” M ary hu rried out of the principal’s room ,
    tingling with a deep sort of resentm ent. It wasn't because of w'hat Miss G
    raham had said about m arriag e. Undoubtedly she had given good advice. It w
    as because of w hat she had said about Mr. M endham . M ary h erself liked
    Mr. M endham and respected him . One day she w as leaving the school a t the
    sam e tim e th a t Mr. M endham passed out of the teach ers entrance, and
    because M iss G raham was standing by. M ary w aited for him and asked him
    if he would walk with h e rsince they both wTent in the sam e direction. A
    few days la te r when he had walked hom e with h er she asked him to come
    into tea a t h er boarding house. It w as four o’clock and her boardinghouse
    keeper, who w as an English woman, alw ays had tea in the little parlor. A m
    onth la te r M ary found herself one evening after dinner eagerly w aiting
    for Dick M endham who had invited h er to go to the th e a te r with him . M
    ary w ondered w’hy she was so feverishly eag er for the tim e of his a rriv
    a l to come. Then as she w alked beside him and la te r sa t beside him in
    the subw ay going to the th eater she reflected to herself that he looked m
    uch m ore a ttra c tive aw ay from school And com ing back a fter the th
    eater th at night R ichard M endham asked M ary to be his wife. M ary
    accepted him a t once. “I never dreamed that you would have m eat least not
    right away/ Dick told her, and Mary was w'ondering how much Miss Graham’s
    advice had had to do with her quick decision. He was the first man who asked
    her, and she had accepted him. They planned to be married in the summer
    after school was over and Dick told Mary that be would never consent to her
    teaching after they were married. He him self was giving up teaching when
    the summer came. He had a position waiting for him in a schoolbook
    publishing company and had been teaching for two years to fit himself for
    this work. His uncle was the president of the concern. In June Mary
    announced her engagement to Miss Graham. “Not Dick Mendham' said she,
    amazed. “What made you accept him ” “You did,” said Mary, her eyes glowing.
    “You told m e to accept the first man that proposed. And I want to thank you
    for your very good advice.” The spedmt ti I n re Stntt t s tu. »n, I tre J

    from your LOCAL ELECTRICAL CONTRACTOR •r the Wisconsin Power and Light
    Company WI4 npHERE are several things I don’t like about him. since you ask
    m e!" declared Hazel, with her best air of haughty superiority. ” In the
    first place I don’t care for his frayed collars, or that old shiny suit he
    wears. Then again, he’s sim ply bourgeois! I haven’t any time to spend with
    men who are not interesting. I have never heard Sam L ester say one original
    thing.” Sissy Anne, sm aller, and usually m eeker than Hazel, flared up with
    sudden indignation: “ Interesting people don't usually w aste them selves
    and their ideas on persons whose m ental level is lower than their own. “ I
    suppose you m ean m e! And C harles Hutchins, and m other, for th a t m
    atter! Well, I don’t care w hat you say, C harles H utchins h as a future.
    He’s in Hollywood rig h t now. and he’s going to have a tryout! You can ’t
    claim anything like th a t for your friend S am m y." “Children! C hildren!”
    M rs. T u rn e r s distressed interrupted. “I ’m tired of all this arguing.
    H azel, I don’t like to h ear you c riticize Mr. L ester because of his
    shabby clothing, but I think your sister is right, Sissy Anne, when she
    insists th at he’s h ardly good enough for you. H ereafter, I m ust request
    you not to spend so m uch tim e with him. Ju s t because he takes his m eals
    here is no reason why he should expect to be received into the fam ily
    circle.” Sissy Anne w as very young, and she had never been in love, th at
    is, never before, and she w asn’t quite sure why h er h e a rt ached so d u
    ring the next few days. Only Sam L ester did seem so sort of friendless,
    when he took his seat a t th eir table w ith the re st of th eir boarders. L
    etters cam e from C harles H utchins, who lingered in Hollywood, aw aiting
    his tryout. Often Hazel read excerpts to the other b o ard ers with m uch
    gusto. As, for instance, when C harles wrote: “ The advantage I seem to
    have, aside from m y personality, is m y training In oratory. I guess those
    days I spent coaching for the sta te scholastic contest will m ean a good
    deal to m e now. “ A ch aracter, th at fellow! Sam L ester m u rm u red
    once, then subsided into a yet deeper quiet under the influence of the p a
    in e d surprised glances th at w ere suddenly turned upon him . C harles H
    utchins w as the m ost prom ising young m an in town, and folks had alw ays
    expected m uch of him . They di Y t think it behooved a shabby soda fountain
    boy to criticize him. T hat w as the night Sissy Anne defied h er m other
    and sister and strolled to th e front gate with Sam L ester. In the
    gathering dusk he suddenly placed a hand on Sissy Anne’s, w here it rested
    on the gate post, and began trem ulously: “ I ’ve been w anting to tell you
    som ething. Sissy Anne, bu t you h aven’t given m e a chance lately. I've
    been w anting to say’ “Sissy A nne!” It was a very flustered, indignant M
    rs. T urner who bore down belligerently upon them , ju st in tim e to see
    the Umid handclasp. “ You will com e in the house this instant! Mr. L ester,
    you will please tak e your m eals elsew here after thia. I haven’t room for
    you!” Sissy Anne cried a lot after that. During the week th at followed the
    episode h e r cheeks actually paled and she. w ith all h er lack of
    experience, could not doubt the truth. She was sick a t h eart, and it was
    all because she was m issing Sam L ester. Dutiful d aughter though she was,
    yet love will have its way, and there cam e an evening when Sissy Anne
    boldly slipped out of the house and strolled along the stre e t and she knew
    Sam L ester walked at th at hour. And when she m et him , as though by
    accident, they turned aside and sought a still quieter street, and Sam was
    late to work th a t night. The next m orning Sissy Anne .as not at the
    breakfast table, and Hazel, sent to waken her, cam e ru n ning back with a
    tearstained le tter, found on h er sister’s pillow. I “ I ’m sorry, but I
    love Sam L este r and we a re getting m arried today. I ’ll w rite you from
    Hollywood. And at the luncheon table, w here Mrs. Hutchins end her m other
    sa t in dism al silence, wondering how best to disclose th eir sham eful
    secret, the second bom b exploded, when the young woman who w as assistan t
    to the postm aster, exclaim ed: “ Well, isn’t th at ju st sim ply
    astonishing about Sam L ester. All this tim e he'» been w orking evenings at
    W ard's soda fountain, and sitting h ere so quiet and shabby and all the tim
    e he was working on a book! Sold it, too, and this m orning he went to
    Hollywood to see som e director who w rote him he w anted to buy the m ovie
    r ^ h ts ! They say # ’s ju st as good as ¿nade a fortune! Did you folks
    know anything about it' One dazed m om ent for Hazel and Mrs. Hutchins! A
    swift realization that, with a little selfpossession now. the fam ily
    reputation w as saved. “ Well, we ought to know! Sissy Anne m arried him
    this m orning and went to Hollywood with him! He's a fine young m an and all
    that, but of course we didn’t w ant Sissy Anne to m a rry so young.” RIGHT

    TOWNSEND NEWS It is not far from w h ere the country stands today to the
    “debt limit,' w'hich has been se t by law. Most thoughtful people are
    convinced that w e cannot pursue much further the path we have followed the
    past six years. If the policy of “spending for reco v ery” continues to be
    pursued, the tim e may not be far off wnen there w ill be no m oney for
    relief. During m ost o f the six years the “em ergency” has existed an
    increasing number oi people have been convinced th at the one policy which w
    ill save business industry, credit and the selfrespect of needy citizens o f
    A m erica is the Townsend Plan. AH else which has been tried has failed. It
    is tim e nowr to stop dangerous and expensive tem porizing. Is it humane to
    continue a policy which regim ents m illions of our citizens into VV.P.A.
    and relief, dulling am bitions, denying them opportunity, consigning them to
    the lowest step s on the em ploym ent ladder, and restricting them and their
    offspring to the bare and m iserable daytoday e x istence under the pitiful
    lim itations of the dole plied by the Federal Surp1 is Cc m odities
