MISS CARRIE POPE
DIES IN MINNESOTA
Friend* were shocked Thursday
friends frw Euu Claire, presented when it was learned that Miss Carrie
an unusually fine program at the reg- | Pope, who had been visiting in Alular
o f the Woman’s club j bert Lea, Minnesota, had died. Some
last Wednesday evening at the Luth
eran ckfcirch. The program was
spons j ed by the Drama Department
x t the club.
The Lutheran church was filled
when Mrs. Baird and her friends,
Mrs. A. Eugene Hatch, mezzo-sop.'aarrts
Mrs. James W. Jensen, pianist,
•and Mrs. L. T, B oom , reader, trriv-
'ed and were presented h y Mrs. E. E.
Homstad. The ladies Had been dinner
guests at the New Freeman hotel of
members o f the department and officers
before the 'program.
Mrs. Baird was seated at a desk
on a raised platform to the right of
the altar. Mrs. Jensen, ’at the piano,
and Mrs. Hatch, soloist, were hidden
from the audience by a screen. It
was an artistically arranged program
with Mrs. Baird delivering her narrative
in the form o f a direct address
to her late mother, and woven in the
theme were songs and music. Her
tribute to her mother was beautifully
done. Simple, unaffected, reminiscent
ro f days pone by, she painted a
picttlre that Will linger in the memory
 of her audience. The church was a
fitting place ‘to present the program,
as it left with its hearers the feeling
o f a sermon.
Mrs. Baird’s parents, the late Hon.
•and Mrs. George Olson, o f Taylor,
lived in the county for a quarter o f
a century. They came to America in
1867. Spent a year in Boston, 19
years in Chicago, 25 in Taylor, and
"before returning to Norway where
"they both passed away, they lived for
a few years in Marinette and three
years in Milwaukee, where they made
a home for their youngest son. Their
'Lutheran church was the old “ Fllinganer
Samfund” , no church edifice,
■but faithfully held meetings in the
Tiomes o f the community. As Mrs.
Baird told o f the busy life o f her
mother she summed it in a sentence :
“ Then I took it all for granted. Now
I marvel at your endurance.”
Mrs. Boortz, Mrs. Jensen and Mrs.
Hatch were all outstanding artists,
and their contribution to the program
was much appreciated. Had
there been even more music and
songs it would not have "been euough.
The concludipg solo, “ The Good
Shepherd” , was beautifully done.
Following the program refreshments
were served by Mrs. "William
Hoffman and her committee o f the
"Ladies Aid, and a social “hour enjoyed.

and Mrs. Wang and two daughters,
Carol and Ardis, eame here from
Greenwood. Mrs. Wang has a sister,
Mrs. Waiter Trimberger, living in
Granton and before her marriage
Mrs. Wang taught at Neillsville, so it
is like going home again to move
there to make her home. She ana
the children will move as soon as
they can find a house, which is not
too easy, judging from the fact that
Mrs. Wang spent a day tht-re last
week without finding a suitable one.
Mr. W ang's father. Ole Wan*, has
made his home with them here, and
will accompany them to Neillsrrille.
Eugene Greenlee, who transferred

Mr. and Mrs. Melvin Hoagenson
and their nieces. Misses Vera Negard

Falls one day last week to see Robert
Hoagenson, who has been quite ill.
We are pleased to learn that he is
again improved and back at his studies.
He had an attack o f flu,
crawled out into circulation a little
too early in order to take some exams.
was asain laid up, this time in
the hosnital with pneumonia threatened.
His case yielded to treatment
however, which wag fortunate.
way folks, without thinking, thought
that Miss Pope would go on as always.
Her death occurred February
9, 1939.
She had gone to Albert Lea tarty
in December to visit her cousins, Mr.
and Mrs. C. W. Turnbull. Although
she had suffered o f heart trouble for
a great many years, she had been
about as usual and had having
a fine time, taking various trips and
accepting invitations right along. She
suffered a stroke o f apoplexy about
8 o’clock Thursday morning and passed
away at 4 :30 that afternoon, without
recovering consciousness.
Miss Pope has been a life long esident
here and has been a well known
figure. She graduated from high
school with the class o f 1877, and
afterward engaged in teaching in the
county. Her first school was at Old
Irontown, located at the mouth of
Levis creek. Fifty-three years ago
she taught in the city for the first
time, having charge o f the third
grade. Throughout this state and
many others are scattered what she
called “ my boys and girls” and she
never lost interest in one o f them.
Nothing gave her more pleasure than
news o f them. She taught between
forty and fifty years, and afterward
for a time worked in the office o f the
county superintendent.
She was born in this city, August
4, 1858, the only daughter o f the
late Mr. and Mrs. R. G. Pope. Her
father conducted a general store and
engaged in the lumber business here.
He built the fine home in the second
ward which is known as the Pope
house. He died many years ago. Her
mother, who came here to mahe her
home when there were hut two
graves in Riverside cemetery, lived to
the age o f 99 years, and died March
11, 1936. An invalid for many years
the love and devotion her daughter
gave her will live among the epics o f
the town.
During the past few yeans Miss
Pope moved and lived in a different
world. She enjoyed getting out
among people as she could not while
caring for her mother. She was an
honored member o f the Woman s
Club, joining the business woman s
department, and had invited the department
to meet at her home for the
February meeting, which she postponed
until later in the spring as she
found she would not he home in time
for the meeting.
The Pope home was opened for the
funeral service, which was conducteded
by Rev. H. A . Allison a t t w o
o ’clock Saturday afternoon. Hans
Hanson, Frank Shankey, James Pugh,
Osborne Tollack, Henry E. Olson and
Ralph Lund officiated as pallbearers.
Interment was made in the fam ily lot
in Riverside.
The home was filled for the service
by friends who came to pay their last
tribute o f respect to the departed.
We were among them. Seated in the
far end of the kitchen, which too was
filled, we could not help but fe d that
the kitchen symbolized a side o f her
life as clearly as did the voice o f Rev.
Allison reading beautiful psalms from
the far room. It is a long room,
with a range in the middle o f the
west side, a pump in one corner, on
a long: stretch o f white oilcloth tacked
on the wall were hanging the pans
and tools she had so often used.
Standing on the table was a water
jail with an old tin dipper in it. A
shallow dripping pan hanging on the
wall had been worn on the edge by
the handle from being pulled out o f
the oven. One time we visited Miss
Pope in that kitchen, and she had eut
for us a crust from a freshly baked
loaf o f bread she had just taken from
the oven. Miss Pope had walked
hundreds o f miles in that kitchen.
The picture o f Miss Pope herewith
was taken some years ago, but
except for her hair which was a lovely
snowv white, is a very good likeness.
She had a beautiful complexion
which she took great pride in caring
for. and the memory o f her working
in the garden wearing an old fashioned
slat suribonnet is a picture that
will linger with her friends.
She is survived by two cousins,
Will and Ellis 0orswill. o f the town
o f Irvine, and the Turnbulls o f Albert
Lea are also cousins. Mr. and
Mrs C W. Turnbull and the latter s
sister. Mrs. Morris Hagen, came from
Albert Lea for the funeral.

BIGGARS TO OPEN NEXT WEEK

Saturday morning from Chicago,
where she has been on a spring
buying trip for Biggar’s store, which
she will open formally in the near
future.
Redecorating and remodeling has
been going or during her absence
and the fact that so many changes
are being made has taken longer than
expected. She had planned on being
able to open the store in a couple
o f weeks after it closed, but it will
be Friday o f next week before the
work can be finished and the store
in the shape she wants it. It promises
to be an unusual and outstanding
store.

and helpfulness to others, regardless
of what it would cost her in time or
effort. She has spent not only long
nights o f vigil with the sick and sorrowing,
but weeks and even months,
comforting and helping those who

her life continues, even here, in the

SKEET CLUB SETS UP
PHEASANT FEEDERS
Art Carish, a member o f the Gun

at Hardy’ s garage. Sunday members
o f the club placed the feeders in the
territory surrounding Black River

She loved her home, friends and

great-grandchildren, 19 o f each surviving.
Among her grandchildren
are Vern and Kenneth Wickham,
whom she brought up as children following
the death of their mother and
her daughter, Mrs. Arietta Wickham.
One other daughter, Mrs. Dora Server,

Ernest, a resident o f this city, passed

The death o f Mrs. Van Buskirk removes
from our midst not only one
o f our oldest settlers, but a strong
and unusual character. The fine,
hardy stock o f her pioneer parents
and the conditions under which she
grew up and which developed, by necessity,
her character are not repeated

age o f 88 years.
She bore and brought up her own

PROOF OF AGE IMPORTANT IN
CLAIMING OLD-AGE INSURANCE
Inaccuracy in giving one’s age
when applying for a social security
account number may delay the payment
o f old-age insurance benefits
when the time comes to make a
claim, Mr. Sands, manager o f the
Social Security Board’s field office at
Eau Claire, informed insured workers.
“ Under the Social Security A ct” ,
Mr. Sands explained, “ old-age benefits
are not payable until 65, except
in the case o f death, when a lumpsum
payment is made to the wage
earner’s relatives or estate. P roof
o f age is required to those who file
claims for the single cash payments
made to workers now reaching 6-5,.
provided the claim is for more than
$100. P roof will probably be required
from all workers claiming the
regular retirement annuities scheduled
to begin in 1942,
“ The Social Security Board must
therefore know the exact date o f a
worker’s birth before it approves his
claim. If the age, as stated when
the claim is presented, does not tally
with the birth date which was given
in the application for t social security
account number, complications
may arise, so that the worker may
have to wait before his claim can be
paid.
“ In handling the records o f the
43-odd million men and women who
in the application for a social security
account numbel-s, the Bureau o f
Old-Age Insurance has found evidence
that not every one has exercised
proper care in stating age on
his application. Probably the most
frequent reason for misstatement has
been fear on the part o f some workers
that they would lose their jobs, if
in some way, their employers should
learn their real age from the information
given. Reports o f the Bureau
of Old-Age Insurance” , Mr. Sands
continued, “ indicate that workers
have rapidly come to accept the
Board’s repeated assurances that the
information given it by the employee
will under no circumstances be passed
on to the employer. Many people,
realizing the later difficulties
which may result from inaccurate age
statements, have sent the Board further
information and asked that their
records be corrected. The Board is
prepared to make such corrections on
request from the account-number
holder.”
The Board ateo wishes to make
proof o f age at the time a benefit
claim is filed as simple as is consistent
with business-like procedure. Its
experience to date in the settlement
o f lump-sum claims indicates that
most people will have little difficulty
in producing evidence that will be
accepted by the Board as proof o f
age declarations.
It was explained that acceptable
evidence may be obtained from a
wide variety o f sources. The Board
will accept as unquestionable proof:
First, a copy o f a birth certificate;
second, a copy o f an infant baptismal
certificate; and third, the
sworn statements o f two persons such
as a physician and a nurse, who have
personal knowledge o f the date o f
birth. Recognizing that in many cases
it is virtually impossible for older
people to obtain such primary evidence,
the Board has provided for the
submission o f secondary evidence. It
has ruled that when the applicant
for benefits explains in writing that
such evidence cannot be obtained
without great difficulty and considerable
expense, other evidence will
be considered. In general, documents
or copies » f documents o f
many types showing the individual
age may be submitted, if dated prior
to August 14, 1935— the date o f the
signing o f the Social Security Act.
Much evidence o f this sort will be
accepted by the Board especially
when supported by supplementary
material.
“ For example the birth record in
the old family Bible may be brought
forward, or a search o f old school records
may reveal the worker’s birth
date as recorded in those years before
he felt the desirability o f lowering
his age by a year or two. Even if
a man or woman is unable to locate
any o f these records dating from his
childhood, other possibilities remain.
Almost every one can get copies o f
age statements made at the time o f
joining some fraternal, civic or religious
society, or when he took out insurance,
obtained a job in any branch
o f the Government service— Federal,
State, or local. Still other sources o f
verification may be found in the enrollment
records o f the War and Naly
departments. Passports, marriage
certificates and other Government
records wil allso be accepted as corroborative
evidence.
For those who need this service a
“ Change o f Record” form, available
in all the Board’s field offices, provides
a convenient way for employees
now having social security account
numbers to inform the Board o f any
corrections that should be made in
the data previously furnished on application
blanks or other papers.
These corrections include change o f
name and date o f birth.

SENIOR P A R T Y
Friday night, Feb. 24, will be the
night for a big social gathering in
the gym. The occasion is the senior
party.
A system has been worked out for
inviting other students from school.
Each senior may invite one other
guest providing he (senior) pays 10
cents admission charge for his or her
guest.
The party has been nicknamed the
“ All Feb. Party” . There will be
games and other activities for those
who do not care to dance.
Come on Seniors— invite your
guests and let’s make this a real
party.

“ Black River Breeze, 1939.”
Get busy! There isn’t much time
left!
“ N. OF 52”
Reaching the school last Wednesday
I wondered what the large crowd
was that had gathered on the grounds
but I didn’t have long to wonder, because
some one asked me if I had
seen “ those dogs” yet. Dogs? What
dogs? Goodness! I see dogs every
day!"
But these didn’t turn out to be
just ordinary dogs. There were seven
Huskies from “ N. o f 52” on their
way to the New York W orld’s fair.
Two men were taking them through.
They were beauties! Some black,
a white one, brown ones, and a beautiful
gray-black one. How surprised
I was to learn that he was part wolf.
The dogs have been on the road
for about two months, traveling on
the average o f thirty miles a day.
Traveling is slow in this part o f the
country, due to too little snow, too
many pavements and not enough unfenced
fields.
Seven puppies were born to one,
“ Brownie” on the way. One died on
the way down, and another died
Tuesday night.
The kindergarteners got a free
ride. Every last one o f ’em! Some
o f the Junior girls in the 6th and 7th
period Home Ec. classes were wishing
they were young again.
It was something new here, and
I’ll wager that one-fourth o f the
students were a little late that day.

OLD FAIT H F U L
Never in the history o f the Oriole
has a report been written on a student
who has never entered the
school building. This student receives
his daily assignment o f driving passengers
to school each morning. Each
morning he wishes to stand still but
after a cough and sputter he lives up
to his name, Old Faithful, and gets
to school on time. Here he sets at
rest and shows his old age. Born in
1924 at Henry Ford plant, he serves
as a school bus. “ Its motor” , the
drivers say, “ is in A number 1 condition”
. But I don’t see where he
keeps it. No doubt it was a handsome
Model T Ford at one time. But
now it’s just ‘ Old Faithful’.
Washington
NEVER Til HEW A DOLLAR AWAY
George Washington did not throw a dollar
across the Potomac, nor is there any
rec orded instance of his throwing a dollar
away at any time.
The father of His Country was a thrifty
business man and successful farmer who
was noted for his sound management of
his financial affairs. He was a shrewd,
careful buyer who not only did net throw
dollars away, but kept accurate records
of every penny spent.
In your personal struggle for financial
independence you may find inspiration in
the life of George Washington.

MRS. ROSE McCREDDEN
Mrs. Rose McCredden passed away
Wednesday evening, February 8,
1939, about 5:30 o ’clock at the home
o f her daughter, Mrs. Rose McDonald,
where she has made her home
for the past three years. She has been
poorly for several years, suffering of
heart trouble and very seriously ill
for the past nine weeks. Death was
the result o f Bright’s disease, which
developed toward the last.
Funeral services were held Satur
day at 10 o ’clock a. m. at St. Columkille’s
church, in Shamrock, o f which
she was a member. Burial was
made in the cemetery there and she
was laid to rest on the place in which
she was born. Her father, the late
Henry Crossen, had given the land
from his farm for the church and
cemetery years ago. The choir from
St. Joseph’s church in this city sang
at the service. Dan McDonald and
Richard Bielinski served as altar
boys. Jerome Mulrine, Ed Bowler,
Earl Taylor, Clarence Hunter, Floyd
McPeak and Rollie Storandt officiated
as pall bearers.
Rose Crossen, daughter o f Mr. and
Mrs. Henry Crossen, was born May 7,
1865, on the Crossen farm in Shamrock.
She was the seventh o f ten
children. Her death leaves but two
survivors o f the fam ily: Mrs. John
Roddy, o f Minneapolis, and Mrs. Lizzie
Pumer, o f Ashland. Neither o f
them were able to attend the funeral.
A brother, Paddy Crossen, o f Sparta,
was buried the day she was taken
to bed by her last illness nine weeks
ago. She was united in marriage December
19, 1876, to Dan McCredden,
and they made their home for many
years in Monroe county. Eleven years
ago they moved to this city, and
seven years ago 'Mr. McCredden preceded
her in death. She afterward
sold their home in the second ward to
Mrs. John Capper, and made her
home with her daughter, Mrs. McDonald.
Eight children were bom o f this
marriage, o f whom five survive and
deeply mourn their good mother.
They are: Mrs. Mary Radcliffe, and
Mrs. Rose McDonald, o f this city;
Mrs. Leona Koehler and Henry McCredden,
o f Cataract; and Willie
McCredden, o f Sparta. Three have
preceded her in death: Eddie six
years ago; Sarah three days; and
Dan, 24 years, who died ten years
ago. She also leaves 17 grandchildren
and five great-grandchildren.
Mrs. McCredden had a wide and
warm circle o f friends. She had been
a lifelong member o f St. Columkille’s
church. She was deeply devoted to
her family and interested in their
welfare and that o f her friends. She
always made her own fun, and even
during her last illness she would have
her little jokes. Her home during
the early days was the gathering
place for the young people who were
assured o f a good time there. She
was friendly and generous and kind.
During the time her children were
young she devoted herseif to their
welfare and one time it was five
years between her visits to town.
That she will be missed by her family
and friends goes without saying.
The sympathy o f all goes to her children.
MISS FERN SMITH
Miss Fern Smith, formerly o f Cataract,
died Thursday, Feb. 9, 1939,
at her home in Patchogne, Long
Island, New York, where she was
teaching.
She was a daughter of the late Mr.
and Mrs. William Smith, o f Cataract.
She is survived by three brothers,
Earl and Wayne, o f Saskatchewan,
Canada, and Edward, o f Sparta; and
one sister, Miss Jessie M. Smith, of
Chicago.
Funeral services were held Monday
at the Lanham mortuary in Sparta
and interment made in Woodlawn
cemetery.
RAYM O ND K AG EL INJURED

Twin daughters were born to Mr.
and Mrs. George Larson at the B. R.
Falls hospital last Thursday, Feb. 9.
Each weighed 6 pounds. Memory
faileth when twins were born to any
Merrillan parents, but its been a long
time ago.
The Merrillan Cribbage players ( ? )
went to B. R. Falls last Wednesday
night and played with the county
seaters several games o f that game.
No one brought home the individual
score o f each player (this scribe not
being there) and it’s just as well
perhaps as what a beating the Merrillan
men got! We mention only two
scores. Marshall Hugdahl for Merrillan
got high with 148 and George
Hoffman was low with 2. Yes, only
2. The others were in between and
most o f them under 100. The Black
River total was 2461 and the Merrillan
total was 1248. So the county
seaters win again with a total of
1213. This makes three straight wins
for them.
Mrs. Giles Rickard called up the
Central office last Friday morning
shortly after 9 o’clock and informed
the central lady that her house was
on fire. Miss Vera Vincent, who was
at the Central office, rang the fire
bell and it was only a few minutes
before the fire department was at the
scene o f the fire with the hose all
attached to a hydrant ready for action.
It proved to be only a stubborn
chimney fire, but the house was
full o f smoke as the chimney was
plugged. The only damage done was
by smoke and fire around the chimney
in two rooms. It was a good
practice run for the department and
they responded promptly.
Richard Walters, Slim Smith and
Claude Ransom were coming home
from work at B. R. Falls one evening
last week when a sleigh loaded
with pole wood pulled right across the
road in front o f them. Mr. Walters,
who was driving, instead o f hitting
the sleigh or the horses, thinking perhaps
that some one might be killed,
pulled to the outside o f the road and
took to the ditch. The car turned
over two or three times, becoming a
wreck, and the only one hurt was Mr.
Walters who had an injured leg. _ It
was a mighty close escape from being
killed.
The local fire department held
their annual oyster stew supper at
the I. O. O. F. dining hall last Tuesday
evening and to which the members
o f the village board were invited.
Besides the supper and to make
the evening more interesting the
members initiated their newest member,
Homer Rhoades. Homer made a
good candidate and took all the oaths
and did all the stunts required with
promptness and submission. A fter
initiation the members played cards.
Mrs. Nora Wright has repurchased
her former home in Merrillan and expects
to occupy it some time after
April 1st and again become a resident
o f Merrillan. The present occupants,
Mr. and Mrs. Lafe Onstad,
and Mr. and Mrs. Bob Wilkins, are
now looking for another place. It is
rumored that the former family may
move away from Merrillan as Mr.
Onstad’s work is out o f the village
most o f the time.
Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Van Winter
and Mr. Davidson drove to Reedstown
last Saturday, and visited in
that vicinity. On returning Sunday
afternoon they were accompanied by
Mrs. Azra Buchholtz and children o f
La Crosse and on reaching Sparta
they picked up Miss Francis Johnson
who had been spending the week end
there with friends. Mrs. Buchholtz
will spend some time here.
Miss Marion Schoengarth entertained
at a four course breakfast at
01 o ’clock Sunday, Feb. 12, at the
home o f Mrs. N. G. Erickson. The
table was beautifully decorated in
valentine motifs. The breakfast was
given in honor o f Miss Betty Johnston,
o f Madison.
Some time ago these columns reported
that Walter Nash had resigned
from the village board. Now John
Anger has been appointed in his
place. The other day Eric Erickson
resigned from the board, and Gibson
Gile has been appointed in his
place.
W. M. De Lapp has been confined
to his bed the past week or so with
almost an attack o f pneumonia. Edmund
Nichols has been taking care of
him during th e‘day and Walter Keyes
during the night.
CHURCH A C T IV IT IE S
The Home department which met
last Thursday with Mrs. Oscar Olson,
had a fine attendance in spite
o f a heavy snow storm.
The lesson leaders were Mrs. Jennie
Dunn, Mrs. Charles Neilsen. Mrs.
Frank Larson, Mrs. E. Pierce, Mrs.
Florence Erickson. The topic for
this quarter beginning in January is
a Study o f the Life o f Peter the
Apostle. The worship services for
each lesson included Bible references,
beautiful hymns and prayers,
which could easily be applied to our
spiritual ife.
It was voted xo financially assist
in the attendance project o f the Sunday
school.
Mrs. Chas. Neilsen, the Ladies Aid
president, suggests that if your birthday
is in any one o f the months from
July to December inclusive, be sure
to come to the birthday party which
will be held at the M. E. church at
6:3 0 p. m. Wednesday, Feb. 22. Tables
are reserved for each o f these
months.
The Sunday school superintendent,
Mrs. Stewart Olson, and other officers
have started an excellent project
for increasing school attendance.
Each child having as perfect an attendance
as possible from now until
Easter w.ll be given a gold cross o f
suitable size. This will be not only
a regard but to be given as a symbol
o f Christianity and with the hopes it
will mean more to each child than
just a reward o f merit.
M EN’S SUPPER
Another one o f those popular mens
suppers will be given at the M. E.
church dining room next Thursday,
Feb. 16th. Service will begin at 5:30
until all are served. Bring your

Merrillan Daze
The first issue o f the Merrillan
school paper was published by Geneva
Rhoades and John Jarolimek on
Friday. The staff intends to have
another issue out in about two weeks.
Each publication o f the Daze will
be dedicated to some organization
around school. This first publication
was dedicated to the basket ball
boys. The staff hasn’t decided who
they will dedicate their next issue to.
Again we would like to remind the
people o f Merrillan o f the band concert
held at the high school gym Friday,
Feb. 17. The sole purpose of
this concert is. not to make money
but the get the people o f Merrillan
interested in their high school music,
and show them we are really working.
T
he Merrillan High school band is
rather a young organization. Anyone
who has been in band knows the
difficulties that arise in a young band.
It is hard to get people to join a
small band because they don’t think
it is much o f an honor. It is £ard to
get them to choose the instruments
the band most needs. We need clarinets,
baritones, altos and trombones
bad, very bad. But, no one wants to
play these instruments.
Perhaps the biggest problem in
band work is to try to impress upon
the young musician the necessity o f
practice. Benny Goodman once said
“ There are three rules to have a good
band. These are practice, practice,
and more practice” . This is easy
enough to understand because the
young player really wants to play,
has the enthusiasm, but the instrument
won’t do what he wants it to
and he is easily discouraged and don’t
feel like playing tiresome scales and
runs. The blasting o f a horn may
be an agony to neighbors and relatives
but once mastered will well repay
itself.
Friday night we would be more
than glad to have every seat in the
gym filled. The prices are those that
any one can afford, 5-10-15 cents,
and by coming you can show us you
are really interested, you really want
to know what we are doing and you
are ready to give us the necessary
support we so badly need.
P. T. A.
Money in the P. T. A. treasury
amounted to $14.90. It has been
spent as follows: Hot lunch equipment
$5.30. Boy Scouts $9.60.
By distributing the P. T. A. funds
as follows the organization will be
completely dissolved.
A Good Practice Game
Saturday afternoon Merrillan High
school defeated Camp Irving CCC 24-
8. Camp Irving was allowed only 3
field goals to Merrillan’s 11. The
boys proved they could win in spite
o f the “ rubbing in” they got last
week in school. Boys, consider this
a pat on the back and keep up the
good work.
The game scheduled with Melrose
has been cancelled. Feb. 24 Merrillan
plays B. R. Falls at B. R. This
should be a very good game, the
teams are about equally matched.
The School Library
The library at school has been
completely remodeled. Mrs. Rosoer
has worked on it ever since school
started. She has catalogued books,
completed the author and title cards,
fixed subject and reference cards,
cleaned and mended and made an inventory
o f all the books.
The library is now in fine condition
and we hope that all the students
will help to keep it that way. The
students have been instructed on how
to use the library and should know
where to look for books when they
need them.

COUNTY AG EN T NOTES
Homemakers
Considerable misunderstanding prevails
due to the fact that at the last
leaders meeting Miss Jonas announced
the dates o f the third series of
meetings as February 14th and 15th.
This office did not notify the leaders
of these meetings because of the fact
that Mrs. McCordic, Home Management
specialist, will conduct the remaining
two leaders meetings in place
o f Miss Jonas.
Due to the fact that Mrs. McCordic
could not complete the schedule
on the dates as set up by Miss Jonas,
it was necessary to make up a new
schedule for the two remaining leaders
meetings. Efforts have been made
to set the dates o f the 3rd meetings
some time during February but such
would not fit in with Mrs. McCordic’s
schedule. Club leaders will be notified
o f the new schedule some time
during the next few days.
Cow Testing
The annual meeting o f the Jackson
county Dairy Herd Improvement Association
was held at the court house
last Saturday.
Glen Vergeront, Extension dairyman
o f the College o f Agriculture,
spoke on the importance of a good
herd sire in building up profitable
producing herds.
The officers elected for the present
year include- Harvey Gilbertson,
president; Archie Nelson, vice president;
Stanley Dettinger, 3rd member;
Charley Nordstrom, 4th member;
Clifford Ristow, secretary and
treasurer.
Testing rates will be the same as
during 1938: 0 to 12 cows-$2.25,
13 to 23 cows $2.50: 24 to 30 cows
$2.75; above 30 cows 10c additional
per cow.
Any one interested in joining the
association should get in touch with
this office or with any o f the members
or directors.
Soil Program Meeting
A township committeeman instructional
meeting was held at the county
house last Thursday to acquaint the
committeemen with the procedure to
be followed in filling out the farming
intention forms for 1939.
Committeemen in most townships
have decided to notify the farmers to
meet with them at some convenient
place in the township in order that
they may complete the work in the
shortest time with the lowest possible
cost. The committeemen have been
given a copy o f all farm maps in
their townships in order that they
may have something definite to work
with when making out the intention
forms.
The state committee has notified
the county committee that farms will
not be checked this summer unless
farming intention forms are filled
out for those farms. All farmers
in the different townships will receive
notices from their township committees
as to the meetings.
Checks
Soil conservation program checks
covering the final transmittal o f 1938
applications for payment forms have
arrived at this office. Notices will be
mailed to the farmers notifying them
o f the time and place o f distribution.
Approximately 50 applications for
payment forms have been returned
for correction due to errors in signing,
etc. Checks covering these applications
for payment forms will arrive
at a later date. Such checks will
be mailed directly to the applicants.
Erosion School
A short course in soil-erosion control
will be held at the Wisconsin
College o f Agriculture, Madison, on
March 13-17. The course is mainly
designed for young men who are interested
in erosion problems and in
setting up erosion control systems on
their own farms.
Material covered by the short
course, includes instructions in farm
surveying and leveling and information
on field and pasture crops which
prevent or control erosion. Some attention
will also be given to the
planting and care o f trees on hillsides.
Moldy Silage
A great deal o f moldy com silage
is found in silos throughout Wisconsin
this winter, and questions are
raised as to the cause o f it.
From an examination o f various
kinds o f moldy com silage. Gus Bohstedt.
feeds authority at the Wisconsin
College o f Agriculture, finds that
much o f the corn was put into the
silo too dry. In many cases while
silo filling was begun before the rainy
spell in early September, the filling
was completed only after repeated
delays during which the corn, in
spite o f the abundant moisture, ripened
and dried too much for best silage.
The fact that the corn which is
naturally heavily seeded with mold
spores was perhaps more heavily
seeded than usual due to the wet
weather, may in part account for the
unusually heavy spoilage o f corn in
the silo this season.
When corn is rather dry, Bohstedt
reports better results if it is cut into
short lengths to help it pack. Instead
o f cutting corn inch or inch in
length, it is best to cut it only 
inch or even hi inch in length. It
may also be necessary to play a small
stream o f water on to the corn as
it goes through an ensilage cutter.
Unless the corn is well packed and
moist, the air trapped in the silage
permits high temperatures o f fermentation
which produce discolored
silage and a loss o f valuable nutrients.
Much mold may be formed as
a result.
Air, humidity and warm temperatures
favor the growth o f molds i'1
a silo the same as elsewhere. In very
warm silage, molds may grow ahead
o f daily removal o f silage. Even
though it is but a few inches downward
each day, it makes it appear as
if the whole center portion o f the silo
is moldy and spoiled. Because o f the
fact that for a foot or more next to
the outside wall the silage is cool, no
mold is found in that region.
Molds may have different colors—
white, pink or blue. Feeding tests
have shown that these differently colored
molds are not necessarily harmful.
Without question, considerable
amounts o f moldy silage are fed to

It is best, however, to throw
out the most heavily molded portions

A fter years o f discussion, the matter
o f permitting states to tax the
salaries o f their citizens who are federal
employees, and extending federal
Income taxes to salaries o f state and
municipal employees, is before Congress.
Until a recent decision o f the
Supreme court was rendered, it was
assumed that such a move could not
be made without a federal constitu
tional amendment. Several presidents
have recommended that amendment.
The present occupant o f the White
House has mentioned the proposal repeatedly.
At every session o f Congress
from one to a dozen or more resolutions
embodying the proposed amendment
have been introduced by as
many members. The resolutions were
referred to committees where they
were permitted to lie, without hearing
or discussion, a common fate of
many worthy measures under the rule
o f absolute control given committee
chairman. It is only another instance
of archaic rules which vest power in
the hands o f those selected as special
guardians o f legislation.
The decision o f the Supreme court
in the Gerhardt case rather than anything
else is responsible for breaking
the jam and letting loose a tax bill
instead o f a resolution for an amend
ment. It is claimed by those opposed
that the bill, if enacted, will be unconstitutional,
but at any rate it is
before congress with fair prospects of
passing. The states which have no income
tax laws o f their own are strong
in opposition, as it would mean the
taxation o f their state and municipal
officials without taxing for state purposes
the federal employees domiciled
within their borders.
States having income-tax laws are
likely to reap larger returns from the
added taxes on federal employees
that the national government will receive
from its taxes upon the servants
o f states and their local subdivisions.
In some states like New York there
are many high salaried officials who
are now paying no federal taxes on
their salaries, but in most states the
salary rolls are on a lower scale, except
in some o f their larger cities.
The federal government has an income
exemption o f $2500 for married
tax payers, and $1000 for single people.
In many counties and smaller
cities the federal taxes therefore
would be relatively small. State exemptions
are relatively lower, and the
more generously paid federal workers
consequently will contribute more of
their incomes to state and local treasuries.
It is anticipated that the national
treasury will augment its income under
the proposed law by about $16,-
000,000, while the states having income-
tax laws may collect several
times that amount on the incomes of
federal employees. Some states will
not benefit because o f their lack of
income taxes, unless they enact such
laws at the present sessions o f their
legislatures. If congress passes the
proposed legislature it will not apply
until next year.
The matter o f taxing incomes from
federal securities by state and local
governments, and o f incomes from
state and municipal obligations, is
even more important than that o f the
reciprocal arrangement for the taxation
o f salaries o f all public employees.
Under the present system, the
bonds and incomes from the bonds of
the federal treasury are not taxable
by states and the state and local
bonds and jr*comes from them are not
assessed unde’.- the normal income tax
rates o f the national government. The
federal debt, together with that o f
agencies whose obligations are guaranteed
by the government now exceeds
forty billions, with an annual
interest charge o f more than a billion
dollars. The states and their subdivisions
have securities outstanding
in excess o f fifteen billions, with an
annual interest charge o f a half billion
or more. State and national income
taxes would thus have a broad
income base exceeding one and onehalf
billions annually o-n which to assess
new taxes. Not all that large income
would be fully taxed by either
o f the governments, as the same exemptions
would apply as those granted
tax-payers under present laws.
This subject is not new to congress,
but as in the case o f the salaries o f
government workers, nothing has
come out o f it except almost endless
discussion without action.
The peculiarities o f moves for
economy which were marked in previous
sessions are as apparent in this.
Little items o f national expense are
carefully scrutinized. A couple o f
weeks ago the annual measure carrying
an appropriation for combatting
the grasshopper plague in the middle
west came before the House. The
losses by grasshopper visitation in
some sections o f the northwest probably
exceeded one hundred millions
o f dollars, the losses borne by individual
farmers. The damage would
have been still greater on many farms
except for the government activity in
providing poison to kill the hoppers.
The department estimated that $6,-
000,000 would be needed to eradicate
the pest, and possibly free the farms
from such dangers for years. The
House cut the amount to $2,000,000.
some members facetiously claiming
that grasshoppers were a good form
o f crop control.
The appropriation bill for the independent
offices came up this week.
It carries expenditures amounting to
one-billion eight hundred millions,
$290 millions more than the budget
estimates. Included in the great
amount, which will equal one-fifth of
the total national expenditures for the
year, were $200,000,000 for building
more ships for the Merchant Marine.
More than half that amount will
go out in subsidies to the ocean
steamship lines which also receive a
subsidy for operating their own vessels.
One-half the remainder will be
loaned the same shipping lines at a
low rate o f interest as a further aid
in building their ships. And the leader
who brought in and favored the extra
$200,000,000 for the ocean lines
was the same leader who fought for
the reduction o f the fund for grasshopper
control. Economy is wonderful
for the smaller matters, but the
budget balancers will have to get
busy with something bigger to make
economy really work.
MERLIN HULL.
O LAU S PETERSON
Olaus Peterson was born on the old
Peterson homestead in Vosse Coulie,
September 9, 1862, the oldest son of
the late Bernt and Anna Peterson,
pioneers o f this community. His entire
life was spent on this homestead
helping to develop it from a wilderness
to the now present farm.
He was always interested in the
honest affairs o f the community. A
member o f the town board o f Springfield
for many years, he also served
as school treasurer in Vosse Coulie
for some 20 years. He took an active
part in church work, as long as
he was able, serving as trustee and
secretary o f the Trempealeau Valley
congregation for 20 years.
Olaus lived a quiet and unobtrusive
life, always trying to avoid saying
or doing anything to cause ill will
among those with whom he associated,
and his Christianity was shown in
his deeds.
He passed away peacefully at 2
a. m. on Monday, January 30, after
an illness o f only a couple o f days,
at the age o f 76 years.
He leaves to mourn his death, two
brothers, Albert B. Peterson, o f Blair
and Bennie A., on the home farm ;
three sisters: Sophie, o f Tacoma,
Washington; Emelia (Mrs. K. Sandberg)
o f Chicago; and Myrtle (Mrs.
E. B. Christopherson), o f Pigeon
Falls, Wis.
Funeral services were conducted at
the Trempealeau Valley church, on
Thursday Feb. 3, with the Rev. A.
J. Bringle in charge. Rev. K. Urberg,
o f Blair, brought greetings from the
Urbergs and spoke o f the strong
friendship that had existed between
his father, the late Rev. S. S. Urberg,
and the deceased Olaus. Rev.
E. B. Christopherson gave a few remarks
on the life o f the departed one.
Mrs. John Hellickson and Mrs. Alfred
Peterson, o f Ettrick, sang “ Heaven
Is My Home” and “ Look Down, O
Lord.” Memorial wreaths to the
amount o f $41.00 were given by
relatives, friends and neighbors, to be
sent to Lutheran charity institutions.
MRS. CHAS. G. W H EELER
Eva Maule, second daughter o f the
late Mr. and Mrs. Matthew Maule,
was bom in Ottowa, Waukesha county,
on March 17th, 1861. When a
little girl this family moved to Jackson
county locating on a farm just
south o f Hixton. Here Mrs. Wheeler
received her education in the Sechlerville
school.
In early youth Eva took up sewing
and was considered a fine dressmaker.
While still young she returned
to Waukesha county to follow her
trade, making her home with her
brother and family, Mr. and Mrs.
John Maule, o f Dousman.
On Aug. 28, 1900, she was united
'n marriage to Chas. G. Wheeler, o f
Milwaukee. Mr. and Mrs. Wheeler
nade Dousman their home for sever-
9l years, where they followed truck
gardening.
In 1916 Mr. Wheeler’s health faild
and he was ordered west under a
ioctor’s care. The spring c f 1917
?ound the Wheelers in Upland, California,
which has been their home
for the last 22 years.
Mrs. Wheeler passed away on Monday,
Jan. 30, 1939, after a short illness
o f three weeks. She had not
been in robust health for some time,
but was able to make the trip from
California to Wisconsin last October
but only remained for a few days as
her longing was satisfied after seeing
the old home and her family.
Funeral services were held at the
home and the Upland M. E. church
on Thursday, Feb. 2, conducted by
Reverends Samuel Hughes and Dr.
R. C. Stone. Interment was made
in the Bellevue beautiful cemetery.
Surviving Mrs. Wheeler is the devoted
husband, one sister, Lizzie
Maule, and two brothers, William and
George Maule, o f Hixton; several
nieces and nephews besides a host o f
friends and kind neighbors.
Mrs. Wheeler was a woman o f
strong sterling character, o f a sunny
disposition, making friends wherever
she went. ***
P. A. H EM M Y’ S LETTE R
There was considerable activity in
the committee hearing last week and
the capital had the appearance o f a
beehive. The farmers who are interested
in rural electrification made a
splendid demonstration in favor of
the Wisconsin Development Authority,
and succeeded in getting a rather
encouraging report from the committee.
However, on Friday the Assembly
engrossed a bill that will
wipe out the W. D. A. and apparently
they will do likewise when the bill
comes up for final passage.
The married women’s bill was heard
and attracted a group o f people
numbering several hundreds at its
committee hearing. Most o f the participants
in the hearing were women,
some opposing and some favoring the
same. Apparently, the committee deferred
action for two weeks at which
time they will again consider the bill
and possibly a week thereafter the
Assembly will take action thereon.
Two years ago the non-partisan
bill was defeated by a tie vote, but
last Wednesday members o f all political
parties united in defeating the
bill by an overwhelming vote. However,
we still have a resolution before
the Assembly to submit the question
o f non-partisan elections to a referendum
vote o f the people.

COMMON SENSE CO U SERV ATIO N
By L. H. Kingston
A bill to abolish the conservation
commission has been introduced into
the legislature by Assemblyman Henry
J. Berquist, Rhinelander Progressive*
His bill, 2 8A, would have the
governor appoint, in place o f our
present six man body, one commissioner
to hold office only during the
term o f the appointing governor. The
salary o f this commissioner o f conservation
would be $5,000 per year.
Mr. Berquist says he is acting as
a friend o f conservation. We will
remember, however, that the loudest
o f all local minorities protesting certain
hunting and fishing regulations
laid down by the conservation commission
have come from Mr. Berquist’s
vicinity. These protests were
made even after the conservation
committeemen from the 71 counties
in the state had recommended those
hunting and fishing regulations. Then
there are one or two individuals in
his part o f the state who have made
it known that they desire Mr. Mac-
Kenzie’s job as conservation director.
These facts make Mr. Berquist’s motives
look suspicious.
If this bill were enacted it would
mean that we would have a new commissioner
o f conservation as often as
every two years which would result
in the total loss o f all continuity o f
purpose in conservation affairs.
Sportsmen have been fighting for
years to chase politics out o f conservation
in this state and they have
been quite successful. Mr. Berquist’s
proposal would throw conservation
right back into the old political pot
and our conservation department
would be in hot water all the time.
A good many states look to Wisconsin
as the leader in conservation
progress. Our present independent
and non-political commission has set
up an intelligent and comprehensive
conservation policy and a splendid organization
to administer it. Mr. Berquist’s
bill to abolish all this would
set conservation in Wisconsin back 20
years.
Last week Mr. Berquist in a speech
broadcast by radio, attacked our conservation
department. He referred
to the conservation congress, made up
o f the committeemen elected annually
in the various counties, as “ stock
troops” o f the conservation department.
“ The conservation congress is organized
from the top down, and it
takes its orders from the top” , Mr.
Berquist said during his broadcast.
“ It reaches conclusions only if they
suit the ideas o f the director o f conservation.
The whole setup is a sham,
intended to fool the people into believing
they have some sayso in conservation.”
It so happens that the writer of
this column served two years as a
member o f the conservation congress,
one o f which I was on the state
council. I state positively that I
never received any instructions except
from the people o f the county
I represented, and I never heard of
anybody else in the congress being
approached in any way by anybody
in Mr. Mac Kenzie’s department.
Mr. Berquist’s statements were extremely
uncomplementary to the hundreds
o f sportsmen and conservationists
who have given two days o f their
time each July and paid their own
expenses to attend the conservation
congress at Madison for the good of
conservation.
NORTH W ESTER N DRUGGIST
TELLS OF LAN GE FIRE
We wish you could see the Black
River Falls picture o f the Lange fire
as it appeared in the February North
Western Druggist. It was the same
cut we used in our paper, but printed
on book paper it was much more effective.
The holiday decoration of
balsam which made our town beautiful
during the holidays, stands out
profusely against a background o f
smoke. The magazine also carried a
description o f the fire and the news
that the Lange store, in its temporary
location, is doing business as
usual.
Also under the Wisconsin section
o f the magazine is the following interesting
news o f a former townsman:
“ P. W. Gullard, for 31 years
owner and operator o f a successful
pharmacy at Greenwood, has never,
in his 40 years o f service to the
public, permitted himself to work in
a drug store where cigarets are sold.
No cigaret windows in that store!”
Under “ Twenty Years A go” was:
That twenty years previous to that
time (1899) “ nobody swatted a fly”
— ‘ nobody had appendicitis” — “ milkshakes
got the call” — “ advertisers
did not tell the truth.”

and Young Men
Throughout this nation there has spread a very great social
and fraternal Brotherhood— an immense group o f men who
have banded together for mutual interchange and develoj -
ment o f helpful social and cultural contacts.
This Great Brotherhood was organized just 75 years ago and
now celebrates its anniversary next Monday evening, February
20th.
A commonplace Bill, Frank, John or Andy may ask you to
join in this fine evening o f entertainment and refreshment—
Don’t turn down the invitation. Make it your special effort
to be there an enjoy an evening with the
Knights of Pythias
SPECIAL NOTE TO ALL RESIDENTS OF THIS COMMUNITY—-
Be sure to tune in your radio at 9 p. m. Monday
night on either Columbia or NBC coast-to-coast hookup and
listen to the Pythian address o f Senator Tom Connally of
Texas.
If the past years o f bleeding and stress have taught us anything,
it is that our only hope for recovery, as well as future
solidarity and growth, lies in co-operation. No man, no business,
no organization can succeed which fails to recognize the
interdependency o f all men in great Brotherhoods.

TH E COOKIE JA R
Marcella Gill Relyea
I wonder if any mother is ever
lucky enough to escape that period
o f babyhood when a youngster suddenly
decides to go on a hunger
strike and stubbornly refuses to eat
all the things that are good for him.
It is astonishing at first and alarming
at last how very determined a
small toddler can be, and how persistently
he can hold out against parental
pleading, force, and all other
alternatives. The baby books made it
sound so very simple when they advise
the young mother to quietly remove
his food and offer it again at
the next meal.” We can’t help wondering
if the various authors were
ever really confronted by a hungry,
stubborn small individual who would
accept enough milk and bread to live
on and, teeth firmly clenched, refuse
everything else. The 0 her. . hJo|j
a fury o f despair I took a firm hold
on the young man o f the family and
fed him applesauce by forcethe
smoke o f the battle had cleared
away the applesauce dish was empty
a n d probably half o f it found its way
down an indignant throat. The rest
bedecked me from eyebrows to clean
apron. Nursing a pair o f bruised
shins and comforting an hysterical
baby I gave up and took the coward s
way out. From now on he shall have
bread and milk— but heaven send him
an appetite soon!
A very nice letter came to the
Cookie Jar the other day frw i Mrs.
Mina A. Paulson, o f Watertown, S.
Dakota. Mrs. Paulson was bom and
reared in Jackson county, so no
doubt is acquainted with many of
our readers. She sent the two following
recipes, which we appreciate
very much.
Cranberry Jelly
Wash 1 quart cranberries and put
on to cook in a granite kettle with 1
cup boiling water. Cook 10 minutes
and then fdd 1 lb. sugar. Cook five
minutes longer and then run through
a sieve. Wet small cups or molds in
cold water and pour in jelly, allowing
1 cup to each person. This never
fails to make a firm, bright jelly,
and is very attractice in individual
molds.
Cranberry Jam
Wash 1 lb. or 4 cups o f cranberries
and put them in a granite kettle
with j'uice drained from a 14 oz.
can o f pineapple. If this is not a
full cup o f juice, fill the rest o f the
cup with water. Cook until berries
begin to pop, then boil 5 minutes.
Cube the pineapple, and add to the
berries with 2 cups sugar. Stir well
and boil 5 minutes longer. Dip molds
in cold water, then fill with j'am.
Here is a dandy short cut for the
busy housewife, who hasn’t time to
make rolled-out cookies. Mix cookie
dough and drop small portions on the
cookie sheet. Now dip the bottom of
a tumbler in a pan o f sugar, and
press the dough flat. If a tumbler is
too small, try the top o f a baking
powder can, it will press out a good
sized cookie.
And there was the Scotsman who
bought only one spur. He figured
that if one side o f the horse went the
other was sure to follow.— Exchange

Taylor 20-H ixton 14
By Allen Hulett
Taylor, still in the battle with one
game behind Independence, went to
Hixton Wednesday night and defeated
Hixton 20-14 in a hard-fought
game. Taylor started out with little
scoring and trailed Hixton 4-5 at the
end o f the first quarter. The second
quarter was a duplicate o f first quarter
and half ended 6-7 in favor of
Hixton. The second half Taylor scorers
found themselves and Taylor led
12-10 at the end o f the third quarter
with game ending 20-14 in favor
o f Taylor.
Raymond Owen played an outstanding
defense and offensive game
leading the scoring with 9 points. C.
Waller followed with 8. D. Lambert
had hard luck on field goals but made
1 point on free throws. A. Hulett
got 2 points on free tosses.
Hixton’s scoring was led by Kleba
and Embretson with 6 points each.
Hixton’s defense was greatly hampered
by the loss o f Oppegard and Jacobson
who got 4 fouls each. Seven
o f these 8 fouls were made on C.
Waller.
Next week, Feb. 16, Taylor plays
Independence in the last game o f the
season. Taylor hopes to win this
game. A win will mean a tie for 1st
place in the Trempealeau Valley
League for 1938-39. We wish to see
many Taylor rooters there because it
promises to be a good game.
Taylor Seconds In Again 9-7
Taylor seconds keep up their good
record by defeating Hixton seconds
9-7. Taylor seconds led most o f the
game. Score by quarters was:
1st 2nd 3rd 4th
Taylor .......................2 6 9 9
Hixton .......................4 4 4 7
High point man for Taylor was A.
Waller with 8 points. R. Owens had
1 point. For Hixton Jacobson had 4
points and Smith 3. There were only
2 fouls called in this game.
Taylor Seconds have won 9 out of
11 games this year and have been
playing good ball. The only games
lost were to Independence and Blair.
Their last game o f the season is next
week with Independence, in which
they wish to avenge their defeat of
Jan. 12.
Taylor High
Ralph Loken
Forensic work began last week
with 12 students enlisting.
The physics class is now laboring
over the theories o f magnetism and
electricity. Most o f the students seem
to be on the negative side when it
comes to rememberirg the material
for a test.
Having completed the Civil war the
American History class will begin rebuilding
the South. Here’s luck to
them.
The Junior-Senior combined English
class seem to be enjoying their
dignified fellowship together. It must
be their interest in 20th Century poetry.
because nothing dangerous, as
yet, has happened.
The Junior-Senior notebooks o f poetry
were collected at 4 p. m. Friday.
Some o f the students are very
disappointed by the fact that trying
to imitate Sandburg o f Lowell (tho
it looks easy) has proven quire ridiciulous.
They sure have their words
a certain way.
The unseen civil strife between the
Juniors over their class rings, is still
going blissfully on. The only solution,
perhaps, will be to patronize
Woolworth’s for rings.
This week being Lincoln’s birthday,
found the Juniors with the program
problem on their hands. Lois
Smith was chosen as head o f Washington’s
birthday, and Ralph Loken
for Lincoln’s birthday. The Lincoln
program proved to be something different;
by having Lincoln’s life portrayed
by episodes performed by
readers on a scenery-less stage. Lois
Smith accompanied with music, these
various acts or chapters.
The cold weather kept many from
school last week.
p ie typing class completed its first
series o f assignments Wednesday.
Many students are way ahead o f the
schedule, so it looks as though races
may be permitted soon.
The Freshmen are busy working
with booklets on “ Julius Caesar” .
They found their first encounter with
Wm. Shakespeare rather perplexing,
although no one is really suffering seriously.
A number o f students are having
the pleasure o f corresponding with
foreign “ school mates.” Almost all
the most noted European countries
are represented in this work. Naturally,
Norway has the monopoly of
the correspondents.
