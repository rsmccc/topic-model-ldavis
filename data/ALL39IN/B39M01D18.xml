            Floods dust storms droughts anddeserts— what are they but direct resultsof improper use of land In the beginning dense forests coveredthe land and our lakes andstreams were cold and clear He whowished to penetrate far enough wassure to find fish and game a plenty Nature provided these gifts and allman had to do was to use them wisely but they were free for the taking—and how we took them
            Today our forests are practicallygone; for them conservation is too late— restoration is the proper wordfor what must now be done Andfrom now on hunting fishing andother forms of outdoor recreation willbe but the by products of properlyexecuted land use and forest restorationpolicy It is going to cost money to coverup our tracks 
            In this coming sessionof our state legislature there aregoing to be many requests for moremoney for conservation— more thanever before no doubt It is to behoped that our legislators will see thevital need of greatly expanded conservationprogram in this state andwill receive the proposals of conservationists kindly

         Wisconsin College ofAgriculture The results of this study whichcompares the methods used by 20highest income farms in Wisconsincounty with those of the 20 lowestincome farms found that by skillfulmanagement income in many casesco aid be increased without increasingthe cost of production Realizing that the operating costof their farms must be held down towithin reasonable limits if they wereto make money but recognizing thatcertain fixed costs would take goodshare of the farm income the 20highest income farms kept more livestockthan average without increasingtheir expense for painting buildingsand equipment and kept theircrop production high without addedexpense for machinery or labor “ After all it is not the total ofthe fixed costs that is important butrather the cost per 100 pounds ofmilk pork beef or lamb per dozeneggs ton of hay or bushel of grainsold” conclude the investigators They found by comparing the highand low income groups that on highincome farms fixed charges amountto only 49 cents per dollar taken inwhile on low income farms it took93 cents for each dollar received They found that for every acre ofcrop land fixed costs amounted to$19 34 on high income farms and onthe low income farms it ran as highas $24 03 They found further thatfor every head of livestock fixedcosts were $59 00 on high incomefarms and $94 36 on low incomefarms These findings they declare bringout that farming as business is notmuch different from other businessenterprises such as running storeor factory In any case there mustbe good volume of business if thecost per article handled is to be keptlow The most successful farmersgenerally operate good sized farms and manage them so as to produce aslarge volume of salable productsas possible Trees
