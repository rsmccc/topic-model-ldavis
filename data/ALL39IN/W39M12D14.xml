FORTY-SEVENTH YEAK WITTENBERG. SHAWANO COUNTY. WISCONSIN. THURSDAY. DECEMBER 14. 1939 NUMBER 5
Economy Wave
Governor Heil's endeavor to keep
the state treasury from going broke
and make “both ends meet” without
calling a special session to enact new
taxes is still the chief topic of conversation
and debate in the capitol city
and state house this week.
Petitions to the supreme court on
highway diversion, emergency board
cuts to state departments, installment
payments of highway privilege*
taxes to municipalities, layoffs of
state employees, and the partial pension
and relief bill vetoes now pending
before the high court, are all part and
parcel of the same thing— an effort to
allow the state to meet expenditures
without calling a special session for
the purpose of new taxes.
Concerning each of the above factors
much is being said for and against the
Governor’s actions. In Madison, criticism
o f the discharging of some %
employees of the state motor vehicle
division with but 10 minutes notice
has been particularly bitter. Madison
merchants have stated that the doubt
in the minds of state employees about
the security of their jobs is reflected
in their business receipts.
Roy Kubista, executive secretary of
the Wisconsin Employee’s association,
after criticizing the manner in which
state employees were discharged. Was
announced that the association would
seek a change in the civil service law
at the next legislative session to prevent
a reoccurence of layoffs without
due notice. Roy Reed, Ripon, member
of the state board of personnel,
and A. J. Opstedal, director of the
board, both have stated that immediate
layoffs are unfair to the employees.
Highway Diversion
Two weeks ago the supreme court
was asked to take original action in a
suit brought by an Oshkosh highway
contractor to enjoin the secretary of
state and the secretary or treasurer
from diverting highway funds for
other than highway purposes.
The supreme court has refused to
consider the action because in the
opinion of Chief Justice Rosenberry.
“ no emergency existed”, and recommended
that the matter be taken to e
lower court. Joseph Tierney, representing
the road contractor announced
that he would take the action to the
Dane county court this week.
Justice Rosenberry pointed out that
highway diversion has been going on
for a number of years and that the
funds had been treated as sort of a
general fund and have been drawn
upon ever since the origin of an emergency
board.
Governor Heil’s announcement that
highway privilege taxes due local
municipalities December 15 would be
paid in four installments is another
matter of conjecture. The League of
Municipalities has announced that they
would take the matter to court to
force lump payment to local units as
the law provides. Attorney General
Martin also ruled that installment
payments would be illegal. However,
Heil announced that he intended to go
through with the payments in four installments
unless the court ruled
against him.
Capitol Notes
Though it has only been in effect
for not quite three months, the state
cigarette tax has already brought in
about one million dollars in revenue,
Wisconsin’s October general relief
load estimated at 174,000 persons was
15.8 per cent above October, 1938, in
numbers, and 36.8 per cent greater in
amount announced the state department
of public welfare.
Secretary of State Fred R. Zimmer
man, governor of Wisconsin from 1927
to 1929, crushed rumors that he will
seek the chief executive job in the
state in 1940 when he announced that
he had no desire to “assume again the
burdens of the governor’s office
Meanwhile State Senator Frank E.
Panzer, Progressive, said that former
tax commission director John A. Thiel
of Mayville will be a candidate for
governor in the next election on the
Progressive ticket and that a Thiel for
governor club will be organized
Dodge county to promote his candidacy.
Repairing Wells of Plant
The P. J. Miller Artesian Well Drill
ing firm of Chicago moved an outfit
here from that city this week to do
some repair work on the wells of the
water system of the Kraft-Phenix
plant. The firm’s men on the job will
also drill a number of test holes. i
Brushes Furnished by Red Cross
The County and City School nurses
have found the American Red Cross
ever ready and willing to cooperate in
solving problems immediately where
aid has been required.
The American Red Cross is aware
of the need for dental hygiene among
our school children. To alleviate this
health impairing menace the Red
Cross has furnished Shawano County
and City with 1500 tooth brushes for
our needy children.
The brushes have been distributed
by the Shawano School Nurse in the
city schools and the County Nurse will
work in cooperation with the teachers
in rural and village schools.
Boy Scouts
The Boy Scouts have been busy reconditioning
toys to be distributed to
needy children. The Scout hall looks
like Santa’s work shop.
The Lion’s Club is sponsoring this
project and will pay for paint and material.

WHS at Birnamwood Friday
A basketball game that will determine
the undisputed leadership of the
Wolf River Valley Conference will be
played at Birnamwood Friday night.
Wittenberg and Birnamwood are on
top of the heap each having won three
conference games and lost none. It
promises to be a battle royal with
Birnamwood conceded a slight favorite
due to the game being played on
their floor and the fact that they defeated
Mattoon 22-18 on Mattoon’*
floor while WHS acquired their win
over Mattoon by a one point margin
on their own floor.

The local squad exerted themselves
very little last Friday evening in outclassing
Scandinavia and Bowler, 32-
17 and 33-14.
A good team is often considered as
good as their reserves. In these two
games the regulars played less than
half of the time, giving the reserves a
chance to show what they could do
and they responded by scoring 19 of
the 33 points against Scandinavia.
Ringstad was high scorer of the evening
with 16 points.

Local Teachers Outclassed
In the games played Tuesday eve
ning the H. S. Reserves defeated the
Marion Junior High 9-8. Marion City
team won over the Wittenberg City
team 26-22 which was well done con
sidering the strength and experience
of the Marion boys. The faculty team
did not make much of a showing
against the Mosinee teachers in losing
32-18. Several factors led to their defeat,
principally lack of practice and
condition. Mr. Torbenson suffered an
ankle injury that will keep him on
crutches for a few days.
Mr. Kuhli
of the State Board of Health spent
Friday in the local school giving talks
to the boys in grades 7-12 on Social
Hygiene. He was impressed by the
interest in the subject and the way in
which the boys entered into the discussions.
Grosjean Musical Revue
Next Tuesday at 3 p. m. the student
body will be entertained by the Grosjean
Duo. They will present a varied
program consisting of selections on
the Hammond Electric Organ, Xylophone
and Vibraphone. In addition to
the musical entertainment there will
be an added feature of ventriloquism.
Persons outside of school that are interested
are welcome to attend.

Injured While at Work
While working near Bowler, Walter
Hartleben. son of Mr. and Mrs. Chas.
Hartleben, received a blow in the face
from a skid pole. The blow was so
severe that the cheek bone was broken.
The accident happened on Tuesday of
last week. On Saturday an operation
was performed on him at the Birnamwood
Hospital for building up the
cheek bone which was splintered in
several places.
While at work in the woods on Wednesday,
Herbert Tratz was struck by
a limb and received a laceration in the
face near the eye. Five stitches were
required to close the wound.
Christmas Decorations
Instead of a large Christmas tree
at the main square of this village,
festoons have been strung across the
square from the four corners and will
be lighted with many colored lights
at night. These are, perhaps, not so
striking as a tree, but have the advantage
of being out of the way for
traffic. Although no accident ever
occurred on account of a tree standing
in the middle of the square, such a
thing was possible at any time especially
during heavy travel. The village
officers had a “bee” Monday evening
and wove the festoons that were to be
hung up as Christmas decorations.
Besides the street decorations, every
business establishment in town is
adorned with Christmas decorations,
and the window displays are beautiful
and show up the offerings of Christmas
goods most effectively.
Surely there is no need for looking
elsewhere than Wittenberg for what
you want in the way of gifts or
holiday goods.
A Fine Holiday Film

“ A Christmas Carol” brings to the
screen the well-known story of the
miser, Scrooge, and his tyrannical and
selfish existence. The reformation of
Scrooge is brought about by the appearance
of the ghost of his dead
partner on Christmas Eve, who says
he has come to rescue Scrooge from
the same fate that befell him during
his lifetime. Three spirits call on
Scrooge, the ghosts of Christmas Past,
Christmas Future, and the miser sees
in these apparitions a drab reflection
of himself. Christmas morning finds
Scrooge a changed man with the
Christmas spirit reawakened in him.
The roll of Scrooge in portrayed by
Reginald Owen, with Gene I/>ckhart|
Terry Kilburn, Kathleen Lockhart.,
Barry MacKay and Lynne Carver in
important roles.

Census Director
Headquarters W'ill Be in Wausau and
Operations Are Slated to Start
on January 2
District headquarters for the taking
of the federal census, scheduled to begin
January 2 throughout the United

opened in the postoffice building in
Wausau, under the supervision o f G.

A small staff will serve the office
until tile census actually gets under

Seventh congressional district, will
be called to work immediately after
the first of the year, says the Wausau
Record-Herald.
The population, housing and agricultural
census is slated to start April
2 upon conclusion of the business poll.
A large additional force of enumerators
will be added at that time, the
supervisor declared. All operations
are expected to be completed by July 1.
Applications for enumerators’ posts
may be made at the Wausau headquarters,
either by personal call or by
mail. Meisner said.
Ten counties comprising the Seventh
district, will be covered by the Wausau
office. They are Marathon, Langlade,
Shawano, Wood, Portage, Waupaca,
Waushara, Adams, Green Lake
and Marquette.

ber 1 has been as coherent as the
gibberish of a Mongolian idiot. Officially
the Ita lia n government was
sphynx-like, but there was no doubt
about the feelings of a mob of uniformed
Fascists who cheered before
Rom e’s Finnish legation and hooted
before the Soviet embassy. Though
moving softly, the fine Italian hand
was seen encouraging formation of
an anti-Communist bloc in the Balkan
states, where the Soviet bear
will positively strike next.
Germany was silent, and with
good reason. To denounce the Reds
after Adolf H itler’s great show of
friendship with Moscow would mean
either (1) the repudiation of Der
Fuehrer and a subsequent admission
that the allies are right, or (2)
a simultaneous war on two fronts
against two hostile enemies (Russia
on the east and the allies on the
west). But a good sign of the average
N azi’s sentiments was the pro-
Finmsh demonstration in Hungary’s
parliament.
How about Japan? Britain believed
the recent Jap-Russian truce
had paved the way for Finland's invasion,
but Shanghai and Tokyo observers
thought otherwise. Said an
anonymous Ja p army m ajor: “ It
is a good lesson. It proves what
we have always suspected, that
Russia cannot be trusted.”
Ja pa n, Italy and Russia were obviously
the nations to be watched,
but no one could accurately predict
their moves.
INTERNATIONAL:
F inlandia
Russia’* invasion of Finland provided
the flrst authentic touch of
fierce conflict which observers have
seen in the European cat-and-dog
fight which started September 1.
Carnage was spreading but so was
peace talk, because most of the civilized
world (except Germany and
Ja p a n ) was outspoken in its denunciation
of Soviet aggression.
Plucky, even though pathetically
outnumbered, the Finns surprised
most m ilitary experts by stalemating
the enemy along a 750-mile
front. Off Hango, one Russian dee

stroyer was sunk and two others
badly damaged by coastal batteries.
While civilians fled bomb-wrecked
Helsingfors, hardy soldiers fought
off the Soviet advance in the north.
They even drove the invader from
snow-bound Petsamo after the Russians
had taken that city with a
new weapon—soldiers dropped by
parachute.
There was no hope for negotiation,
nor did F in land expect to hold out
very long. Foreign Minister Vaino
Tanner appealed to the world for
“ effective help” as well as sympathy.
Later he tried to reopen
negotiations with Moscow through
the Swedish minister there, but only
a few hours earlier the Soviet had
m ade its own peace—with a puppet
“ democratic republic of Finland.”
F inally, in desperation, Finland appealed
to the League of Nations.
Embarrassment
For three years the frightened
league has “ played dead” whenever
a political question was broached.
Last spring Secretary-General Joseph
A. C. Avenol ignored Albania's
protest during the Italian invasion,
and a recently scheduled meeting
to hear Poland’s protest over her
Russian-German invasion was politely
called off for fear of embarrassing
the Kremlin. Reason: Russia's
Ivan Maisky is league president.
Thi* time the league had its last
chance to retain international respect.
Secretary Avenol dispatched
the Finnish protest under pressure
from France and Britain, who saw
a chance of forcing Russia to show
her hand. This hope was dashed
when Russia announced she would
not attend the meeting. Nor did any
observer expect the lesser neutral
nations to support either side in this
controversy.
Instead the peace seekers looked
to Italy, a non-leaguer, and Japan,
whose foreign policy since Septem-
The Other War
Thousands of older French soldiers
were released from the western
front as the allies settled on
their new strategy: Fighting Germany
with seapower and economics
instead of land offensives. There
was no great show of seapower, although
the disastrous allied shipping
losses from Germany's magnetic
mines had apparently been stopped.
British aviators bombed Heligoland,
the Reich’s North sea naval base,
claim ing they had scored direct hits
on several warships. But the biggest
news was the new allied blockade
on all German exports, designed
to strangle the Reich’s sources of
foreign exchange. In the middle of
this strange warfare the Vatican
dropped an even stranger—though
promising—note. Pope Pius X I I
suggested the warring nations declare
a Christmas truce.
American Reaction
Thoroughly startled when Russia
ignored his plea that civilian bombings
be avoided in the Soviet-Finnish
invasion, President Roosevelt
issued an unprecedented statement:
‘‘Despite efforts made to solve the
dispute by peaceful methods . . .
one power has chosen to resort to
a rm s.”
This silenced spiteful critics who
hoped to capitalize by pointing out
how the President had erred in recognizing
Russia back in 1933. But
it didn't silence New York’s Communist
Daily Worker, whose frontpage
editorial accused the U. S. of
provoking war against Russia “ by
using Finland as a pawn.”
Next the President asked m anufacturers
and exporters of planes to
remember “ the unprovoked bombing

COURTS:
Labor Defeat
Painful to 57 corporations, individuals
and organizations was the Su- I
preme court’s decision upholding a
justice department anti-trust suit. '
The decision held them liable to pros- !
ecution, charged with fixing milk
prices, controlling supply and sup- ,
pressing competition in the Chicago '
area. Most pained, however, was
labor. Reason: One defendant is
the m ilk wagon drivers union.
Thus is Assistant Attorney General
Thurman Arnold freed to prosecute
organized labor in his investigation
of building trades, a probe
which was opposed by A. F. of L .’s
President W illiam Green on the
ground that unions are exempted
from such anti-trust prosecution by
the Clayton act.
But labor’s fear goes deeper than
that. If the justice department is
upheld against labor unions in its
building trades conspiracy case, the
unions can be prosecuted in restraint
of trade every time they call
a strike.

T h e n o t W o r l d , bet” after he
F o r e . B e h in d I t had se,‘ up h,s

paragon in the light of international
relations, he counseled for the world
“ a general league, fully a rm e d ,”
the last two significant words im plying
quite a considerable qualification
of all he had written before.
Lord David Davies, president
of the University of Wales, out
for a federated Europe, makes
a s im ilar concession to eternal
cussedness, having first given
his heart to the hawks in I s
advocacy of a league of natio s
staked m ainly on human b rcl ierhood.
Now he calls for t ie
police. His views are relayed
to this country in a letter to
Rep. Harold Knutson of Minnesota.
They are new only in that
he is now narrowing them to a
European federation rather than
a world state.
Now, as for several years past, he
insists that the most urgently needed
arrangement is for a world police
force, in the form of an international
navy, and land forces if
necessary. The lack of power to
enforce decrees is what he thinks
killed the league. Last year, he
formed the new commonwealth society,
with Winston Churchill heading
it in England. He says it is
established and progressing in 14
countries. A federated Europe
would be the first step toward a
federated world.
Lord Davies is not only a U niversity
president, but an industrialist,
a director of the Great
I Western railway and the M idland
bank and chairman of most
of the great colliery enterprises
of Great Britain. He was in
parliam ent for more than 20
years. He was a leader in the
early campaign for a league of
nations union and is now a
trustee.
His proposal, like the several other
plans for continental unity, is
sharply at variance with Clarence
' Streit’s “ Union now.” In Lord Da-
I vies’ plan, the state, backed by
| force, would be the unit in the coj
operative endeavor;*in Mr. Streit's
! plan, the individual is the unit and

WASHINGTON.—It begins to look
as though the cruel war between
the administration and the electric
industry is going to start all over
again, with David E. Lilienthal, of
TVA, sounding the call to arm s and
Corcoran and Cohen, George W.
Norris and John E. Rankin in the
cheering squad.
All of which is mighty interesting
if one traces the history of this c am paign
back for a year.
During that year there have been
three moves calculated to give the
impression that peace between the
government and the utilities was at
hand. These moves were:
1. Starting of the peace drive by
H arry L. Hopkins. This began when
Hopkins’ name was sent to the senate
by President Roosevelt to be
secretary of commerce. Hopkins at
that time talked to a number of
senators and others with regard to
his ideas about business. F irst and
foremost he wanted peace with the
utilities.
This does not mean that Hopkins
was disloyal to either Roosevelt or
the New Deal. But he was firmly
convinced then, and every indication
was that he had convinced
Roosevelt, that something m ust be
done to restore confidence in the
electric companies, to get investors
to putting their money in them once
more, and as a result to start the
utilities spending.
Investors Lack Confidence
So Utilities Do Mot Spend
Before this W illiam O. Douglas,
now a justice of the Supreme court
but then chairm an of the SEC, had
been talking a great deal to the
President, to Hopkins, and to others
about this piled-up lack of spending
by the utilities. Douglas estimated
that for the three preceding years
the utilities should have spent one
billion dollars a year on improvements
and expansions. He said they
had not done so because their m a n agements
did not have the nerve.
Heads of the utility companies admitted
they had not been spending
but said it was not so much lack
of nerve on their j^art as lack of
confidence on the part of the investors,
and hence that no matter what
they m ight be willing to dare, they
had no choice but to defer expenditures
they might otherwise like to
make.
No 2 in the peace moves was when
TVA bought out the properties of
the Tennessee Electric company,
thus apparently making peace between
Wendell L. Willkie’s Commonwealth
and Southern and the adm
inistration. This is the peace just
ended by Lilienthal’s blasts.
No. 3 in the peace moves was the
war resources board headed by Assistant
Secretary of War Louis A.
Johnson. This board discovered
what it thought were some weak
spots in the utility setup, looking
at it from a strictly national defense j
standpoint. While these alleged I
weaknesses were hotly denied by ex- |
perts of the private utilities, the
electric companies were gratified
that this board made no pretense
of using national defense as an excuse
to force further socialization
of the industry.
Then that blew up— the board was
disbanded, and its powers entrusted
to a new body headed by Harold
L. Ickes, who is second in utility
baiting only to Senator George W.
Norris.
So it looks like a long war I
President Roosevelt Hopes
To Curb Federal Spending
President Roosevelt’s hopes to cut
the deficit next year by one billion
dollars are based on two premises.
One is that better business will
largely increase federal receipts
from taxes, and the other is the determination
to cut federal spending.
If he should achieve his goal he
will still be far from balancing the
budget. There would still be a deficit
of something between one and
a half to two billion dollars. But
at least it would be a step in the
right direction—a step which m ight
be highly important in keeping the
budget-balancing and eventual inflation
issue out of the 1940 presidential
campaign.
It is true that this issue was raised
with all the strength of the Republican
party in 1936, and that it
amounted to precisely nothing so far
as afTecting public opinion or
changing votes was concerned. But
the President realizes that the state
of the public mind on this issue
m ay be very different in 1940 from
what it was in 1936.
When the last presidential election
was progressing, business was
improving. It looked as though the
Roosevelt policies were working out
satisfactorily in a financial way as
well as from a social standpoint.
The prospect now is that business
will continue to improve during 1940,
giving a comparable favorable position
with the last campaign. There
are some skeptics who doubt this,
it should be stated. Many economists
inside the New Deal fear a
recession this coming spring. But
the m ajo rity opinion is that there
will be slow improvement, as war
orders increase.
Customs Duties Decrease,
But Business Is Improving
The difference between 1940 and
1936—assuming that the similarity
of improving business during a cam paign
holds g o od-w ill be, as it is
viewed now, that there will be more
people worrying about where the
continuance of the Roosevelt policies
will lead. It was one thing to have
the government spend vastly more
than it takes in for a three-year
period, with obviously improving
conditions apparently resulting. It
m igh t be quite another to have eight
full years (including the last year
of Hoover) in which the government
spent billions more every year than
it took in, with recurring periods
of recession and mild improvement.
Especially as during the eight years
the national debt had been increased
until it is now dangerously close to
the legal lim it of forty-five billion
dollars.
There seems to be every prospect
that Roosevelt's hopes with respect
to increased federal revenues will
be gratified. It is true that customs
duties are decreasing rapidly,
and will continue to decrease if the
w ar lasts. But it is also true that,
due partly to war orders, general
business is improving. This will not
only m ean an enormous increase in
corporation income taxes—the government
takes 18 cents tax of every
dollar any fair-sized corporation
makes, and slightly less, down to
16^2 cents, for each dollar of the
small concerns. It will mean also
heavily increased individual income
taxes.
It is on the spending side that real
difficulty impends. It will be simple
enough to cut the budget estimates.
That has often happened, even under
Roosevelt. Notably in the first
fiscal year of his administration.
But it is dangerous to rely on that.
The key will come not when the
first appropriation bills are passed,
but when the last deficiency bills
appear on Capitol Hill.
Arnolds Drive on Labor
Is IT orrying IS'etv Dealers
Probably as left wing as any one
in the administration, Assistant Attorney
General Thurman W. Arnold
is nevertheless the most unpopular
of all New Dealers among labor
leaders. The answer is his determined
drive against certain labor
practices, and especially his proposed
application of the anti-trust
laws to labor unions.
Reports from American Federation
of Labor circles indicate that
word has reached the office of William
Green that President Roosevelt
is not in sympathy with A rnold’s
policy in this particular. But,
reassuring as this m ay be in cer
tain quarters, there is no sign tha1
the White House intends to pull Ar
nold off.
Indeed there are some who suspect
the President would be verj
loath to take this action, and might
be very uncertain as to what coursf
Arnold m igh t follow if he should.
Whatever the President may do,
it is now apparent that Arnold’s policy
on the application of the antitrust
laws to labor unions still has
to face a court test. This policy
boils down to the proposition that
union activities are legitimate only
when directed against employers
This is the essence of his declaration
that jurisdictional strikes resulting
from union rivalry violate
the anti-trust laws because they do
not concern wages, hours, health or
safety conditions, etc., or an employer’s
refusal to bargain collec;
tively.
Arnold’s doctrine is that a union,
which has a contract with an employer,
is entitled to the same pro
tection afforded by the anti-trusl
laws as a business m an who is thc
victim of a combination in restrainl
of trade by other business men. Departm
ent of justice officials won’t go
so far as to say that sympathetic
strikes are outlawed by their interpretation
of the anti-trust laws.
They say, indeed, that where one
union is striking for a legitimate
object a sympathetic strike by another
union is legitimate.
Stand on Non-Union Goods
Mot Restraint of Trade
In taking a stand against strikes,
boycotts or coercion by unions which
have no “ reasonable” connection
with hours, etc., Arnold does not
classify refusal of union labor to
handle non-union products as an illegal
restraint of trade. As for refusal
of one union to handle the products
of another union, Arnold’s lieutenants
will not peep now but admit
they m ay have to face that question
eventually.
Arnold and his staff are counting
on their anti-trust drive in the building
industry to get them more
money for law enforcement from
congress next year.
Ju s t recently, giving no sign of its
own view, either collectively or individually,
the Supreme court heard
Arnold expound his belief that state
fair-trade acts, plus the Miller-Tydings
act, do not give manufacturers
and distributors free license to do
what they please in the way of price
fixing. He insisted that if they overstep
the somewhat nebulous bounds
of “ reasonableness” they can be
prosecuted for violating the Sherm
an anti-trust act.

There’s a Good Reason
You’re Constipated 1
When there’s something wrong
with you, the flrst rule is: get at
the cause. If you are constipated,
don't endure it flrst and cure it
afterward. Find out what’s giving
you the trouble.
Chances are it’s simple if you
eat the super-refined foods mast
peor’e do: meat, white bread,

tiuntffh' bulk.m And “bulk” doesn’t
mean a lot of food. It*s a kind of
food that isn’t consumed in the
body, but leaves a soft ‘‘bulky”
mass in thc intestines and helps
a bowel movement.
If this is your trouble, you
should eat a natural “bulk” producing
food-such a one as the
crunchy, toasted, ready-to-eat
cereal-Kellogg’s All-Bran. All-
Bran is the ounce of prevention
that’s worth a pound of emergency

T h t Resident was worried. In
▼iew of the prevalent political unrest
and of the convenient fact that
the State of Kadur had been quie*-
cent for years, he had received confidential
instructions from his State
Department to be very discreet in
his relations with the court of Kadur.
It was impossible to misinterpret
the order. It was plainly worded.
He was not to interfere, if it could
possibly be helped.,
On the other hand, he had discovered,
rather to his annoyance,
that Norwood was a very likeable
person, with an exceptionally good
service record. Even prejudice
couldn’t make him believe that Norwood
had accepted a bribe. It might
be impossible to prove that Norwood
hadn't accepted one, and there
m igh t be a cloud over Norwood’s
career forever after. But the Resident
hadn’t a doubt that Rundhia, or
else perhaps the priests, or even
both of them in some nefarious secret
alliance, had framed Norwood.
He was inclined to believe that the
priests’ agents had bought Rundhia,
with a view to some political advantage
after Rundhia should have
come to the throne. Rundhia, he
suspected, would do almost anything
for cash.
Not being a fool, nor even a very
unimaginative man, he suspected
that Norwood’s interest in Lynn
Harding was something rather more
than platonic.
And one could believe almost anything
of Rundhia: even believe that
Rundhia might act honorably, if honor
and the circumstances didn’t
clash with Rundhia’s convenience.
The Resident liked Rundhia. Almost
everyone did who knew him.
But it was a bit difficult to separate
Rundhia, from R u nd h ia’s unregenerate
inclinations and his record.
So the Resident wrote a report,
m arked “ secret,” to the State Department,
in which he respectfully
urged His Majesty the King’s advisers
to oppose Prince Ru nd h ia’*
succession to the throne of Kadur,
He had small doubt that his advice
would be found acceptable.
But that wasn’t going to save Norwood.
It was far more likely to
ruin Norwood, because Rundhia em ployed
a secret agent in Delhi, who
would learn of the Indian Governm
e nt’s intentions about the veto in
next to no time. Rundhia, and Rund
h ia’s friends, would jum o to the
conclusion that Norwood had been
using secret influence in order to
get back at Rundhia for the accusation
of bribery. Rundhia and his
friends would strike back, and there
would be so much purchased, perjured
evidence produced, that Norwood
would have no chance whatever.
So the Resident decided to do
aome private investigation un his
own account.
There was nothing for it but to
call on Mrs. Harding and to ask
her to summon Lynn to the guesthouse
for a confidential interview.
He detested Mrs. Harding. He knew
she was a snob and he suspected her
of being a title-huntress. He had
called on her once, and she had
been damned rude, because she
had n’t understood his position; she
had suspected him of being merely
one more penurious British officer
who wished to make Lynn’s acquaintance.
But there are lots of
unpleasant tasks that a m an feels
called on to undertake, in the course
of duty, so the Resident ordered his
car and set forth, calling en route
at the Post Office to register his letter
to the Department of State, so
that his Parsee secretary shouldn’t
know about it and be tempted to
talk.
Aunty H arding’s locked and labelled
trunks stood in a severe row
at one end of the veranda. Aunty
H arding reposed on pillows at the
other end, where she received the
Resident with hostile politeness. The
veranda faced away from the sunset
and the surrounding trees cast
a deep shadow, so the electric light
had been turned on in the livingroom,
and the only lignt there was
came through the living-room window.
Aunty Harding couldn’t see
h im very well, and she hadn’t her
spectacles. But she remembered his
name, and she had learned, indirectly,
since their first interview,
that he was a personage. So she
bristled self-defensively and patronized
him.
“ Mayn’t I offer you whiskey? You
English are such devotees of that
drink, aren’t you. In the States, our
m en drink Bourbon. Please smoke.”
“ I came to talk with Miss Lynn
H ard ing .”
“ You will have to look for her
•lsewhere.”
“ Oh, I know she’s at the palace.
Is n ’t there a telephone? Could you
• s k her to come here a moment?
I t won’t take long. I merely want
to ask her a few questions.”
“ I can’t do what you ask. I am
b o longer responsible for Lynn. If
1 should summon her she wouldn’t
obey m e.”
“ Oh? I hope nothing serious
has—’’
“ A plot! Dishonorable! Contemptible!
I won’t bore you with my private
»J!airs. It is sufficient to say
that I received an insolent communication
from the Maharanee. She has
invited Lynn to stay with her—without
consulting me, mind you. And I
have received an astonishing note
from my niece, addressed to me,
but intended for Captain Norwood,
of all impossible people! As if I
were a m ail box! And as if I didn’t
know what is being said about Captain
Norwood! It was a deliberately
malicious insult to m e !”
“ Did you forward the note to Captain
Norwood?”
“ No. Why should I ? ”
“ May I see it? ”
“ No. Certainly not.”
“ Well, Mrs. Harding, I think you
are within your rights about that.
Quite commendable. Yes. Very. But
shouldn’t Norwood get it? If you
care to put it in an envelope and
seal it, I w ill have it sent to him
by a very reliable messenger.”
“One more effort to make of me
a mere convenience! I won’t do it.”
The Resident, having felt out Mrs.
H ard ing ’s punches, countered. He
began his attack;
“ Mrs. Harding, it is quite true
that you don’t know what is going
on. If it weren't that Captain Norwood,
who is a gentleman whose
opinion I respect, has assured me
that your niece is a thoroughly nice
girl—”
“ How does he know?” Aunty interrupted.
“ He is an officer of unblemished
record, and a gentleman who has
never done a shabby thing in his
life. That is why I value his opinion.”
Aunty interrupted: “ I have my
own opinion of an ‘officer and a gen-
No, why should I ? ”
tlem an’ about whom even babus and
servants gossip. If Lynn had wished
to associate herself with common
graft and bribery, she might better
have remained in America. We have
plenty of corrupt officials—mostly of
foreign extraction, I am thankful
to say. Many of them Irish,” she
added.
The Resident smiled: “ Yes, Mrs.
Harding. I confess to being Irish.
So look out! I will take no nonsense
from you. If necessary, I will confront
you with Captain Norwood and
let him demand that letter.”
“ What if I destroy it? ”
“ I will have you arrested.”
“ I am leaving tonight,” said
Aunty Harding, firmly.
“ Oh, yes? It is a long way from
here to the station. You have a lot
of luggage. You propose to catch
the midnight tra in ?”
“ I have made my own arrangements
with a native contractor,
thank you.”
“ I understand, then, that you propose
to go away at midnight, leaving
your niece to her own devices.”
“ Yes.”
“ Well, that is perhaps outside my
province. But there is no question
about my responsibility in connection
with Captain Norwood. He is
a distinguished young officer, in temporary
difficulty, who needs all the
legitimate help he can get. He is
well connected, and popular. He is
the younger brother of the very distinguished
E a rl of Ashlawn. N um bers
of people would be shocked if
Norwood were disgraced. You have
a letter belonging to Captain Norwood,
that he possibly needs. Think
that over, Mrs. Harding. It is now
up to you. Good evening.”
C H A PT E R X V III
Norwood went the round of the
sentries. There were only four of
them. They had already received
orders from Sergeant Stoddart. Norwood
repeated the instructions:
“ There are thieves in the neighborhood,
and there is a rumor that
there might be a raid on the camp.
It isn’t likely to be anything serious,
but look out for it. Don’t kill anyone
if you can help it. In any
event, you are to challenge three
times and then fire your first shot
in the air. I am expecting visitors,
who may perhaps approach stealthily.
because their business is secret.
So look out for them, and be careful
not to mistake them for thieves.”
He returned to his tent, where
O ’Leary sat holding an empty glass
with futile optimism.
“ Get out of here, now, and make
yourself useful.”
“ Me— useful?”
“ Yes. Those Brahmins with whom
I talked down near the waterfall
this morning—”
“ Yeah, they slipped one over on
you! I heard all about it.”
“ Hold your tongue then. I expect
they’ll be coming to talk to me
about my visiting the mine.”
“ You need a nurse,” O ’Leary answered.
“ You’d never get your
brass hat one of these days if it
weren’t for your Uncle Moses. Them
there Brahmins are as likely to
come and talk to you tonight as I
am to kiss the Queen of England.
They figure they’ve bought you. And
they figure they can prove it on
you, if you don’t come across.
They’ll sit quiet, them Brahmins
will. What you’re up against is
what I warned you. That Bengali
doctor was too scared for his own
skin to be telling me lies. Set your
lam p to one side of the tent and
eat your supper in shadow, if you
can’t eat in the dark. Watch out
they don’t chuck no more cobras
at you. They’ve guns. They’ve automatics.
And there’s Gulbaz in
back o’ this, so watch out. Gulbaz
and a woman.”
Norwood stared at him. “ Woma
n ? ” he said. “ What do you m e an ?”
“ You told me to mind my own
business. This ain ’t my business.”
“ T a lk !”
“ How about another whiskey?”
“ Do you wish to be sat in the
cook*fire?”
“ Y o u ’d spoil your supper! But I ’ve
been thinking. If you want to know
what I was thinking, I ’ll tell you.
Barring two or three injustices
you’ve done to me, and I ’m of a
forgiving disposition, there’s only
one m an in Kadur, by my reckoning,
who’d pay money to see you
dead and buried.”
“ You may name h im .”
“ Name him yourself. H im and
you was thumbing a guitar and singing
to the same girl. Let's suppose
he knows, for instance, that the
priests slipped you a bribe. And let’s
suppose he thinks you’re honest.
Let s suppose he thinks you’ll earn
the bribe and fix it so the priests
win their case. And him heir to
the throne. And h im and you mashing
the same golden-haired beauty.
He’d be as officer-headed as you
are if he didn’t hit quick—and below
the belt. He’ll hit hard! What’s to
stop h im from spiking the B rahm ins’
case by getting them blamed
for having murdered you? Answer
that one? VThy not lay off the girl?
If I was you, I ’d—”
“ Don’t let me have to caution
you too often, O ’Leary. What I
expect from you is information. I
do m y own thinking. If I should
ever need advice from you I ’ll tell
you.”
“ ’T ain’t never no use advising
nobody about no woman,” said
O ’Leary. “ I know symptoms when
I see ’em. All right, m u m ’s the
word, I ain’t saying nothin’.”
“ Get out of here.”
After supper, Norwood wrote another
letter to Lynn Harding. He
d id n’t tear up that one. He addressed
it in care of Mrs. Harding
at the guesthouse, and then stuck it
into his tunic pocket. He was still
undecided. Determined, but not
ready with his plan. O ’Leary came
and warned him again about sitting
too near the lam p, so he went outside
the tent and sat in the shadow
cast by the rising full moon. A
sentry challenged.
“ C are fu l!” Norwood shouted.
“ Don’t shoot unless you have to.
And don’t shoot to k ill!”
A bullet whizzed past h im —then
another. They came from two directions.
“ Sentries, hold your flre!” he
shouted.
Stoddart came charging up,
breathing hard, fastening his tunic
and belt as he ran
“A ll present, sir! All ready!”
“ Very well, Stoddart. Keep your
hair on. Post two men to guard my
tent. Send two to the horse-line and
the remainder to guard the store
tent. Thieves—1 think.”
Norwood walked ahead into the
darkness, shadowed by O ’Leary.
“ Now w h at?” asked O ’Leary.
“ For the love o’—”
“ Fetch a lantern on a long stick.
H urry .”
Norwood stood in deep black
shadow waiting for him. O ’Leary
ran up with a lantern at the end
of a very long stick—at least ten
feet long.
“ Give that to me. Next shot they
fire, raise a yell that I ’m h it.”
“ Okay. I get you. You’re a credit
to your Uncle Moses.”
Norwood held the pole extended
toward his left to its limit. Ha
walked forward. The lantern danced
as if it were in someone’s hand. A
bullet spat out of the darkness. Norwood
fell. O ’Leary shouted at the
top of his lungs:
“ Stoddart! H i there, Stoddart!
They’ve shot the Captain! He’s
de ad ! They hit him through the
h e art!”
Stoddart and four men came hurrying.
Norwood whispered:
“ Pick me up. Carry me into the
tent feet first.”
“ Mournful and solemn,” O ’Leary
added.
“ Lay me on the cot in full lam p light.
Spread a sheet over me,”
said Norwood.
“ He’s as dead as trouble,” said
O ’Leary.
So they carried Norwood to the
cot and there he lay. in lamplight,
while Stoddart slightly overdid the
business of taking over command.
O ’Leary scouted. At the end of ten
minutes, O ’Leary returned to the
tent.
“ That’s done it. They’ve gone. I
crashed among the bushes like a
pig with a panther after him. Nobody
fired a shot. There wasn’t a
sound. They’ve gone for good. All
Kadur will know that you’re dead,
within twenty minutes. They may
even tell ’em the news at the palace,
though I doubt that. Palates
get the news late, after other folks
have had time to lay their be;s.”
Norwood sat up. He stared at
O ’Leary. O'Leary held his tongue.
He watched, waited. Norwood didn’t
speak for sixty seconds. Then:
“ O'Leary, there is just one chance
in fifty that Prince Rundhia is on
the wall, by that kiosk, where he
was last night.”

“ Temple of Death”
ST R IK E up the band, here comes a sailor—and let that band
play soft, mysterious music to fit the scene, for that sailor
is going to tell us a tale about India, the land where strange
things happen.
W illiam Mutch is the sailor’s name and he lives in New York
City. It was in Ju ly , 1925, that Bill stepped off his ship, the
S. S. Steel Trader, at Bombay and started out to see the sights
of the town. And Bill says he saw the town from all angles—
the funny side and the deadly, serious, too.
R ight off the bat he had a brush with a native corn doctor—
and Bill says the joke was on him . Early that morning when
the ship docked dozens of native peddlers swarmed aboard.
Among them was a corn doctor, who wanted six rupees to take
a corn off B ill’s foot. Bill offered him three, but the corn doctor
shook his head. Finally they compromised. Bill paid him three
rupees and promised to pay him three more that afternoon.
When Bill stepped off the boat there was the corn doctor.
He wanted his three rupees, but Bill told him he’d pay h im
the next day, and he and his buddy got into a gharry to drive
away. But he wasn’t fooling the corn doctor any. That little
Hindu trotted right along behind the carriage yelling, “The
Sahib owes me three rupees,” until Anally Bill stupped him and paid
him the dough.
Bill Manages to Square Accounts.
“ He smiled and said. ‘Thank you. Sahib,' " says BiU. “ But
I didn’t smile because quite a crowd bad fathered to see me
hand over those coins."
So Mother India had her joke on Bill—but she also had another
surprise waiting (or him.
The gharry moved on, with a crowd behind it all laughing at Bill's
expense, and it didn't stop until B ill saw a curious building and asked
his driver what it was. The driver said it was the Pydhoni temple— at

It almost seemed as if the night
knew that Norwood had made up
his mind. He was riding a fresh
horse, but he didn't hurry. lie was
followed by a mounted sais, and by
O ’Leary on another horse. The
horses, the sais and O ’Leary behaved
like a snake’s tail. They followed
the head without asking questions.
Norwood gave no orders. He
d id n’t tell O'Leary what he intended
to do. But as they came near the
palace garden wall, he reduced the
speed a little and O ’Leary, without
needing to be told to do it, went
scouting ahead.
O ’Leary, on the other side, made
plenty of noise. He made a signal,
pointing with his right arm, as he
broke from shadow into moonlight.
There was nothing mysterious about
his signal; he .simply pointed to the
swinging tendril of a baobab. It
overhung the wall in search of earth
in which to take root. It looked
like a python, swaying slightly in
the faint evening breeze.

The efficiency of the United States
m ail is so taken for granted that
very few people really know what
takes place between the time a
stamped envelope is deposited in one
of those fam iliar olive-colored boxes
and when it is received by the addressee.
Strange as it m ay seem, only a
small proportion of out-of-towfl m ail
is actually sorted in the marble
palaces whose portals are inscribed,
“ Neither sleet nor rain . . .”
A letter from New York to San
Marino, C alif., for example, is handled
once in New York and once
in San Marino. In the meanwhile,
however, that envelope may be sorted
half a dozen times in order to
speed it on its way in the shortest
possible time.
For some unknown reason the
United States post office rarely
mentions the R P O (R ailw ay Post
Office) and its important part in the
distribution of m ail, hence very few
people realize that without it our
present postal service would be an
impossibility.
In this country the use of the railway
postal car dates to 1861, when
John L. Scripps, then postmaster of
Chicago, suggested that the mail
which had accumulated at Cairo.
111., on account of the Civil war, be
sorted while it was aboard the train.
A few years of experimenting
proved the merits of this idea and
the use of railway post offices became
a reality.
Originally the post office cars were
used only on the m ain lines of
long-run railroads, but today nearly
every line in the country h a i
service to form a network encompassing
every town and hamlet of
our nation.
Within these rolling post offices
efficient crews of clerks not only
break down m ail shipments into
section and state groups, but also
sort it for cities and then go further
to separate individual letters destined
for different postal stations in
a given city.
A clerk on the New York to
Washington run, for example, ia
expected to know the exact location
of any address in New York City,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington
and perhaps several other intermediate
cities served by that route.

least that’s what the name sounded like to Bill. Bill had a camera
along and he wanted to take some pictures of that temple, so he paid
olt the driver and he and his buddy alighted and went up to the building.
Bill's eye fell on the curious carvings on thr pillars of that
temple, but his pal was impatient. “ I don't like thc looks of this
place,” he said. "I.et's go to some place that's lively and where
we can eet a drink.”
But Bill wanted to cet some photographs first, lie noticed an
open door and saunlered over near it to take a look through it.
"N o one was about," he says, "s o I decidcd to go inside—against
the advice of my friend, who refused to go wilh m e.”
So Bill went in alone. He took off his hat and passed through that
door and up at the far end he saw a large image with a few smaller
ones grouped around it. With his hat in one hand and his camera in
the other, he moved toward that idol. Then, just as he had reached it,
he heard a scream of rage on the other side of thc big room.
Bill Is Frightened by Scrcam of ItaKc.
Bill dropped his hat ond camera. Wheeling around he saw a door
open. A short Hindu dressed in white stood in the doorway waving hi*
arms at him. That was enough for Bill. He started running for the
doorway. "M y friend at the door shouted to me to h u rry ," says he.
"B u t there was no need for him to yell. I was running as fast as I j
could then. I had just remembered my hat and my camera on the floor 1
behind me when I saw four more Hindus coming out of the side door.
They were trying to head me off by reaching the front door before I I
did. They didn't mean to let me get out as easily as I had gone in.
“ Ju st by the door one Hindu tried to get me by the throat.
But my friend, like a good shipmate, stepped in and started to
help me out. He hit the Hindu on the side of the head, knocking
him down. But by that tim e the others were on us and the
fight was on in real earnest.”
Those white-clad Hindus fell on Bill and his pal, hitting, kicking, j
biting and even spitting. Bill says. " I t didn't take us long," hc writes, I
"to find out they meant business. And we were sure of it when we saw |
a knife in the hand of om- of them. He tried to stab me in the chest,
and the only reason hc didn't is that he couldn't reach me. Two of j
his friends were busy right then trying to kick me to pieces and they j
got in his way.”
The Temple Warriors F igh t Their Way to Safety.
The man with the knife turned, then, and ipade a vicious slash
at Bill's face. Bill's pal threw up his arm and the knife ripped
through the sleeve of his jacket. "The Hindu lost his balance,”
says Bill, “ and fell to the floor, giving us a much needed break.
The others gave way a little when he fell—not much, hut enough
to give us a chance. We smashed our way through them, dashed
through the door and out into the street."
Bill left half of his coat behind him in the hands of two of those
Hindus. A small crowd, attracted by the r.oise, had gathered in the
street outside, but for some reason they d idn’t try to stop Bill and hia
pal as they ran past them and down the street. They had only gone
about half a block, though, when the whole mob was after them, yelling
and shouting
‘•But luck was wilh u s," says Bill, "fo r Just then a vacant
taxi came along. We told the driver to take us to the dorks as
fast as he could. He looked at us curiously—and. no wonder, for
we were a sight and a great crowd was after us—but he nodded
and got going.”
The driver was a Mohammedan, or he wouldn't have been so willing
to help them out. He took them to the docks and Bill and his pal went
aboard their ship. The ship didn't leave Bombay for four days, but
neither one of those lads went ashore again. "We stayed on ship,” Bill
says, "expecting n visit from the English police or a Hindu knife between
our ribs while we slept. But neither one of those things happened
and we were glad when the ship sailed for K arach i."

Originally warships fired a saluta
af seven guns, the number seven
being selected because of its mystical
significance from antiquity. Although
the salute at sea was seven
guns, shore batteries were allowed
to flre three guns to the ship's one.
The reason for thia was that sodium
nitrate was largely used in the m anufacture
of powder. T hu was easily
spoiled at sea, but could be very
readily kept on land. The m u ltiuser
three was selected probably
n i n M y s t i c a l S i g n i f i c a n c e
because of its symbolism. With the
development of the manufacture of
powder, the number of guns for tha
international naval salute was mada
to correspond with that of the land
forces. On August 18, 1875, a resolution
adopted by the United States
provided that salutes be returned
gun for gun. At this time the British
salute was already 21 guns,
therefore, this number was accepted
by the United States.

Mrs. O luf Halverson, formerly of
Wittenbertnwho at the present time is
making her home with her son in Milwaukee,
was the first Wittenberg visitor
to call on Mr. and Mrs. E. R.
Dobbert in their new location at Fox
Lake. Having read the news item in
The Enterprise several weeks ago, she
had occasion to call at Fox Lake the
day after they moved there. The visit
therefore was pleasant both for the
Dobbert family and for Mrs. Halverson.
The basketball team of the Homme I
Children’s Home won another game1
on Monday evening from the Witten
berg B team. The first half ended 3
to 2 in favor of the Children’s H ome'
but was not particularly interesting.
The rest of the game was better play-j
ed and provided the spectators with j
some exciting moments. The final
score was 12 to 10. with the B team j
as losers. John Nutter and Marvin j
Anderson tied at 4 points each for,
scoring honors. Each of the other

Monica airplane factory.
On Sunday evening at the Homme
Children’s Home, Miss Clara Pagel
gave an interesting and instructive
talk on the events experienced in her
travels around the world. She was introduced
by Miss Bertha Pearson, also
of Wausau, a friend of Miss Pagel’s
and a member of the Board of Directors
at the Home, who was instrumental
in bringing this unusual bit of
entertainment. The costumes and trinkets
of other countries proved to be
of special interest to the audience.
Mrs. Delia Helgeson and Mrs. Orlando
Helgeson were hostesses at a
miscellaneous shower given in honor
of Miss Mildred Pukall, who will be
married to Raymond Block on Saturday,
December 23, at 4:30 o’clock in
the - afternoon. Many lovely gifts
were received. Chinese checkers and

Mrs. Alvin Pukall.
On Monday evening. December 11,
the members of the L. D. R. from Im manuel
Lutheran Church, Wausau,
made their annual visit to the Homme
Children’s Home. A group of the visitors
sang Christmas carols in th»»
various sleeping rooms, since many of
the children were in bed when the several
cars drove up to the grounds. A
candy treat was provided for each
child, and also a Christmas gift presented
to each child. Each member
could then see the child to whom the
gift was presented, making it more
enjoyable for both parties concerned.
The visitors were shown through the
building and left for home after a popcorn
and apple lunch.
Beams of light from the Christmas
decorated tree and the red and green
candles on the cross-shaped table
showed faintly on the surrounding
evergreen tree giving an atmosphere
of reverence and beauty as a setting
for the annual Christmas socialhusiness
meeting which the local
L. D. R. girls held in First Lutheran
church basement on Tuesday evening.
The Christmas spirit extended to the
luncheon served and the exchange of

For your New Y e ar’s eve party,
! why not plan one that is foreign in

I you like to sway
to the rhythm of
I the rhumba, or
| prefer s w i n g ,
I you’ll find a rhum- f 41
i ba party with a v
menu of Cuban
• delicacies, full of
I charm for your
guests.
There are all
sorts of amusing,
i inexpensive faj
vors to give an authentic note to
| your rhumba party decorations—liti
tie pottery figures and tiny dolls
| dressed in Cuban costumes; and for
noisemakers, a pair of maracas,
those gourd-like rattles filled with
seeds that rhumba orchestras shake
to emphasize the beat of the music,
and tiny wooden castanets that the
dancers manipulate with their hands
as an accompaniment to their steps.
Refreshments, too, can be distinctly
Cuban. A dish that has
gained fame among visitors to Cuba
is rice with chicken—“ Arroz con polio.”
With rolled sandwiches and
plenty of coffee, you have a delicious,
satisfying supper.
The Cuban idea of coffee is small
cups and plenty of them, filled with
strong, black coffee.
If you like,
use decaffeinated
coffee, so that your
guests can drink
m any cups in the
Cuban manner,
without fear of
sleepless hours
later. Remember
that decaffeinated
coffee needs a
little extra brewing to bring out the
rich flavor.
After-Dinner Coffee or Demi-Tasse.
(Extra Strength)
Use IV2 heaping tablespoons coffee,
regular grind, for each cup (Vz
pint) of water. Make by any method
desired. If using decaffeinated
cofFee, drip grind, measure wellrounded
tablespoon instead of heaping
tablespoon.
Arroz Con Polio.
(Chicken with rice)
Cut a chicken into small pieces

By G E O R G E T. E A G E R
TH E R E is a type of advertising
used in business today
which is known as “ talking
to the public over the shoulders
of your customers.” For instance,
a manufacturer of tin
cans does not sell to the general
public. But he does sell to
the packers of food products. So
his advertisements tell the buyin
g public about the advantage
of canned food products and the
can m anufacturer thus secures the
good will of every food packer. His
advertising talks to the public over
the shoulders of the packers who
are his customers.
It is not ethical for dentists to advertise
but a manufacturer of a
product sold to dentists published
newspaper advertisements
headed,
“ Who Stole This
Dentist’s H our?”
and pleaded with
readers to keep
dentist's appointments.
He earned
the undying gratitude
of all dentists.
Since the housewife
gave up baking
bread at home the market for
yeast has been among commercial
bakers. But consumption of
wheat (lour was 21 per cent less
from 1920 to 1930 than it was from
1890 to 1900. So a large yeast company
advertises the health benefits
of eating more bread and creates
good will among its customers,
the com m ercial bakers.
A manufacturer of laundry m a chinery
tells the public about the
benefits of patronizing laundries, a
leading bank advertises its home
city, a railroad advertises the section
of the country it serves, a gasoline
company urges summer tourists
to spend their vacations in the
states in which it does business.
Many businesses that do not sell the
general public can advertise for the
benefit of their important customers
and thus benefit themselves.

A melting pot of the world, America
has created its Christmas traditions from
countless customs brought across the seas
from foreign lands. In these far-away
places the Yuletide symbols of bygone
ages still endure. Here are a few of them:
E N G L A N D :
Christmas to rural Englishmen
means not only the observance ol
Christ's birth, but also a parting of
the ways between the old year and
the new. Preparations are started
for the next year's farm work, which
begins right after Christmas.
Throughout the island such trappings
as the holly and mistletoe rem
a in undying traditions, nor is any
Christmas complete without the
Yule log burning. On clear frosty
nights the carol singers raise their
voices over the countryside. To
many Englishm en’s despair, such
American customs as the turkey dinner
are gaining a foothold.
G E R M A N Y :
Two years ago storm troopers in
Berlin lit bonfires in the public
squares as a revival of the pagan
custom of celebrating the winter
solstice. But this distraction will
not stop the Christmas-loving Germans
from decorating their trees in
every town and village, and joining
in the famed Christmas hymn,
"Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht.”
IT A L Y :
Most Ita lia n families celebrate
Christmas eve and spend the following
day quietly in their homes. Here
it is a feast more for grown-ups
than for children, whose merrym
aking day comes 12 days later, on
Ja n u ary 6. On Christmas eve fam ilies
gather around the “ ceppo” or
Christmas log blazes. At nine p. m.

Refrigerator Tips
Perishable food always should be
placed in the refrigerator as soon i
as possible Raw fruits and vege- i
tables are best washed first under |
running water and the outside o f ,
m ilk bottles wiped with a damp
cloth. Left-overs should be cooled, j
if necessary, and placed in spotless, ,
tightly-covered containers to keep
odors from escaping and uncongenial
flavors from mixing. Foods 1
with strong odors, such as cheese,
if put into the refrigerator, should
be kept on a top shelf.
Cod Liver Oil Lauded
As S o u rc e of Vitamins
Praised, condemned and finally

more nutritious than vegetable

is now recognized as the principal
source of our two most im portant
