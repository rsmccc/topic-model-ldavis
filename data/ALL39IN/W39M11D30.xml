FORTY-SEVENTH YEAR WITTENBERG. SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN. THURSDAY. NOVEMBER 30. 1939 NUMBER 3
Employ ment Increase
Amid all the talk and study of
balanced budgets, national debts,
special sessions for new taxes, installment
payments to local municipalities
and counties to save the state treasury
from embarrassment, and cut appropriations
to state departments,
there came one cheerful note last
week. Private employment which in dicated
better times in September
again spurted on throughout October
and gave promise of an even healthier
status by Christmas.
The federal social security board
announced from Washington that public
employment offices had placed
308,422 workers in new jobs during
October. This marked the fifth time
within a year that previous placement
records had been bettered.
Wisconsin’s public employment offices
placed 6,970 workers in jobs last
month. O f that number more than
half were regular jobs, 324 jobs were
temporary, and 2,753 were short term
or seasonable jobs.
The state industrial commission’s
unemployment insurance division had
good news too. They announced that
unemployment compensation payments
had decreased generally throughout
the year. Last month the department
paid out $219,209.85 to 21,903 workers
while in September $285,301.95 was
paid out to 27,467 workers. The 1939
October payments were about one half
million dollars less than the payments
for October, 1938.
Further proof of gains in employment
and business is shown by the
fact that there has been a steady increase
in the number of employes
covered by the unemployment insurance
law. The number of workers
covered in Wisconsin in Ju ly was 341,-
000. By August the number had increased
to 436,000 and in September
to 447,000.
Slate Employes |jO*e Jobs
But all the good news of improving
business conditions meant nothing to
58 state employees who were tyid off
last week from the new motor vehicle
department. They were the first civil
service workers to feel the effect of
the Heil administration’s repeated
statements that state expenses could
O f the amount collected the first
month, $205,413.73 came from the
floor tax. This is the tax that was
levied on the .stock that retailers had
on hand when the levy went into
effect. During the second month, an
additional $28,148.76 came from this
source. Those who had failed to pay
their floor tax when it was due before
October 1, had a 15 per cent penalty
added to their payment.
Though unstamped merchandise in
the hands of retailers is subject to
confiscation after, November 13, no
arrests have been made.
Test Retail Price Law
A new state law which requires retail
merchants to sell goods at not less
than six per cent above wholesale
costs will have its constitutionality
tested soon before Superior Judge Roy
H. Proctor of Madison.
The case will be argued by the attorney
for the 20th Century market
of Madison, accused of violating the
law, and the Dane county assistant
district attorney.
Several other actions for the same
cause have been started in Madison,
but will probably be deferred pending
a ruling on the test case.

SCHOOL NEWS
Iola Defeats Wittenberg 30-18
Last Friday evening the local boys
met their best opposition of the present
season. It was a very fast, sharp
shooting game from start to finish.
The strength of the two teams was
more even than thc score indicates
but the Iola boys put three balls
through the hoop in less than one minute
to start the second half and it
seemed to dull the spirit of the visitors.
This game marked an even
break with the four teams, Amherst,
Manawa, Marion and Iola, of the supposedly
strong Central Wisconsin
Conference. The boys are now all set
to take on the teams of their own conference
which starts with Mattoon
Friday night which appears to be the
strongest of several of this year’s
members.

The Board of Control of the Wisconsin
Interscholastic Athletic association
has approved the application of W ittenberg
for a 1940 basket ball tournament
on February 28 and March 1
and 2. The schools assigned to each
district will be announced in about one
week. It will very likely include most
of the schools of the W olf River Valley
conference. For many years this
tournament has been held at Antigo.
It should be a credit to Wittenberg
and its new gymnasium to be named
the host for this event. In order to
make this meet a success and a possible
affair the local fans will have to
show some enthusiasm for basketball
games.

Commissioner George W. Rickeman! Ralph W. Hawkins, Pastor.
explained that when the new department,
which combined into one bureau
subordinate divisions in a number of
other state departments, was set up,
it was given a budget of $900,000 a
year. The units of the new department
had a total of $1,150,000 to work
with before they were consolidated,
so a savings of $250,000 must be
effected if the bureau is to operate
on its budget.
Rickeman estimated that the layoffs
will save the state about $75,000 a
year. Changes in the procedure of
licensing motor vehicles will save another
$30,000, he said. To bring down
the expenses to the allowed $900,000,
further savings of about $145,000 must
be affected through further reductions
in personnel and changes in operations.
Governor Heil’s partial veto of the
pension and relief bills as passed by
the 1939 legislature was still news and
a debatable issue in the state capitol
as the week began.
Two weeks ago the supreme court
ordered Secretary of State Zimmerman
to publish the bill, a duty Zimmerman
had declined to perform because
he believed Heil’s partial veto
of an appropriation bill after the
legislature had adjourned unconstitutional.
The high court in ordering the
publication of the bill did not rule on
the validity of the veto action.
Now it appears that the question of
the legality of the partial veto will i
soon come before the state high court. |
Frank Klode, director of the depart- j
ment of public welfare, requested the i
transfer of $115,000, earmarked for
aids to dependent children, to the pen- j
sion fund under authority of the 1939!
pension law.
Zimmerman states that he cannot
transfer this money without admitting
that the veto is constituional. Therefore,
it appears that the welfare department
will have to secure a court j
order forcing the transfer of the funds j
which will open the way for a co u rt;
test on the legality of the partial veto.
Cigarette Tax Harvest
During the first two months the
new cigarette tax has been in existence
it has brought in $854,697.64 to
the state, reports the beverage tax
division.
Collections for the past month
amounted to $347,722.52 which was
divided as follows: meters $157,497.44,'
stamps $153,394.32, floor tax $-128,-
148.76, and permits $8,700.

E D IT O R ’S NOTE—When opinion, are expressed in theie columns, they
are those of the new* analyst and not necessarily of this newspaper.)
POLITICS:
Stump Trail
War and neutrality made way in
November for politics. For between
now and January 3, when reconvening
congress grasps public attention,
politicians have their only pre-convention
chance to sell The Cause of
1940. On the Republican side at least
three stumpers were hitting the trail,
while national headquarters in
Washington planned a skull session
December 7 to m ap campaign strategy.
The Democratic party, meanwhile,
contented itself waiting for
Franklin Roosevelt to say yes or no.
New Y ork’s District Attorney Tom
Dewey was not so busy prosecuting
German-American Bundsman Fritz
TOM D EW E Y
Answer at Minneapolis?
K uhn that he failed to hear the question
most good Republicans have
been asking about h im : “ Where does
he stand on national issues?”
Dewey, like at least two other 1940 j
hopefuls, was preparing to talk, j
F irst on the agenda is a speech at
Minneapolis December 6, where
party observers hoped to hear an
answer. Other stumpers:
(1) Ohio’s Sen. Robert-Taft, who
ranks low ou Gallup polls, opened
his cam paign at Cleveland by criticizing
G allup polls for “ leading to
superficial facts and piling up bandwagon
sentiment.” On his schedule
before Christmas are at least eight
states.
(2) New Hampshire’s H. Styles
Bridges, who has dropped the “ H .”
for cam paign purposes, was found
in Los Angeles.
(3) Michigan’s Sen. Arthur Vandenberg
was silent; so was Pennsylvania’s
Gov. Arthur Jam e s, latest
new candidate.
G. O. P. 1940 strategy will probably
be “ streamlined" if early signs
offer an indication. Seriously considered
is a blitzkrieg from September
to November, instead of a long
campaign. Meanwhile Marion M a rtin,
assistant national chairman, told
reporters of a women’s organization
200,000 strong, which will sell the
party not by punching doorbells but
through social contacts. One job:
To scotch the notion that all Republican
women are rich and wear orchids.
F ran klin Roosevelt kept himself
busy playing with the press. Laying
a cornerstone for the Jefferson memorial
in Washington, he said he .
“ hoped” he could be present when [
it was dedicated in 1941. This, he
commented later, was injected intentionally
to trip up the commentators.
A few days later, dedicating
his memorial library at Hyde Park,
he poked more fun: . . 1 hope
they (the press) will give due interpretation
to my statement that we
hope it will be a fine day when we
open the building.”
At Baltimore. Montana’s Sen. Burton
Wheeler (who may be John
Lewis’ candidate) made a speech
that looked conciliatory with F ranklin
Roosevelt. At Dallas the Texas
E ditorial association, booming John
Garner, took a crack at John Lewis’
criticism of their hero by holding a
banquet dedicated to “ sin and corruption.”
The “ whisky-drinking old
m a n ," who was busy fishing that
day, got himself toasted with milk.
EU R O P E:
Protest or Pica?
A war that hurts civilians is at
once the most painful and the most
likely to end in a hurry. Thus far
the W ar of 1939 has disdained bombing
cities and has even been easy
on troops in the front line. But a
continent whose life blood courses
the seven seas cannot laugh off many
body blows to its merchant marine;
by late November the intensified
warship-submarine-mine warfare
being waged between Britain and
Germ any had taken a big toll and
the price was getting higher every
day. Britain searched for the Nazi
raiders Deutschland and Admiral
Scheer while the air force made a
futile raid on the naval base at
Wilhelmshaven. The navy was ordered
to seize all Nazi ships transferred
to Russian registry.
Cause of this scurrying was the
w a r’s second m ajor disaster. The
Athmia sinking cost 112 lives, but
150 were feared lost when the Dutch
liner Si man lioliiar struck a mine
in the English channel. Both Germans
and English denied responsibility
while Lithuanian, Ita lia n and
Swedish merchant vessels were also
being sent to the bottom. In neutral
ports, word of such disasters
spread quickly; observers wondered
if the protest might not take form
in new peace pleas.
On land, Adolf Hitler had little
chance for western front activity.
He was too busy in Czecho-Slovakia,
where student-inspired uprisings
against Nazi rule were smashed via
“ liquidation” of 12 ringleaders before
a firing squad.
Trouble Ahead
The most incorrigible Finnish optim
ist could not deny that the future
looked tough for the home team.
With negotiators back from their
fruitless talks in Moscow, all Finland
quavered as the vitriolic Russian
press loosed blast after blast
against its Scandinavian neighbor.
Moscow was obviously building up

PAN AM ERICA:
Good and Had
In a happy mood did Secretary of
Commerce H arry Hopkins announce
foreign trade figures for the autumn
months. Exports to the United
Kingdom (except cotton were down
appreciably; so were exports to Belgium,
Netherlands, Spain, Germany
and Poland. But a ray of warm sunshine
came from the south: Exports
to Latin America in October were
28 per cent higher than in September,
$47,000,000 against $36,700,000.
But all was not peaches and
cream. Complaints against the government's
reciprocal trade program
began blossoming in fa rm and industrial
circles, and were even felt
by diplomats.

taxes next year. Secretary of the
Treasury Henry Morgonthau was va- |
cationing at the time, so the dirty
work of repudiating Eccles’ statement
fell to Undersecretary John W.
Hanes. Said he: “ I don’t think he
(Eccles) spoke for the adm inistration.
I doubt seriously if he spoke
for congress. I am certain he didn't
speak for the treasury.”
Observers thought John Hanes’
boss would secretly applaud the rem
ark, for Henry Morgenthau—although
loyal to the President—has
fought deficit spending. And the
treasury, far from stumbling blindly
ahead, is sifting thousands of suggestions
solicited during the past
summer before offering congress
any recommendations on a 1940 tax
program.
That congress may also be contrary
was hinted when Colorado’s
Sen. Alva Adams told the press he
favored establishment of a congressional
agency to “ police” the appropriation
demands of executive
departments, not by way of blocking
requests for funds but to give
the taxpayer a chance to argue his
side of the story
Meanwhile it was learned the
budget bureau may not issue its customary
revised estimate of receipts
and expenditures this year. Like

which is holding its recommendations
in abeyance, the budget bureau

benefit from tariff reductions on
crude petroleum and miscellaneous
agricultural products. This brought
two repercussions: (1) Observers
wondered whether such recognition
of Germany's control over Czechoslovakia

a blunder; (2) the 50 per cent tariff
cut on crude oil imports meant,
among other things, that Mexico
could sell us at a reduced rate the
oil she expropriated from U. S. companies.
Loudest objector to the Latin-
American trade expansion was Fred
Brenckman, legislative representative

pact which would necessitate larger
agricultural imports from that nation
to offset larger exports from the

WASHINGTON.—While it is extremely
difficult to forecast what
the effects of the European war
; will be on the presidential election
campaign in the United States next
summer, it has already insured a
very important effect on the budget
balancing situation. This is the situation,
after all, which is and has
been giving more concern to m em bers
of both parties than any other
one thing, with the possible exception
of the war itself.
There has not been any doubt,
since the war broke out, that the
United States would tremendously
increase its expenditures for m ilitary
purposes. Sharp increases in
the army, navy and m arine corns
•nlisted strength have already g . ranteed
that, with the recondition ng
of the more than 100 World war destroyers
contributing its quota.
But that is ju st the beginning.
There is going to be a tremendous
boost in the appropriation this winter
for airplanes, for training a irplane
pilots, and maintenance of a
larger air force. There will be, in
all probability, further authorizations
for more enlisted men and officers
in the arm y, navy and m arine
corps, entirely aside from the increase
in personnel in the a ir forces
of all three arm s of the service.
Running into more spectacular
figures, however, will be the new
navy building program, and new defenses
for P a n am a , H awaii and certain
points on the A tlantic and P a cific
coasts, not to mention Alaska.
There is very little opposition to
all this. But consider for a m oment
just what it does to the hopes for
balancing the budget! Not that
there were really any such hopes.
Spending-Debt Issue May
ff reck Next Administration
This spending-public-debt issue is
the one on which most politicians
privately agree the next adm inistration
will be wrec\ed. It is the
reason so m an y senators and representatives
say the next President
will be a one-termer.
Their theory is very simple, and
applies to any Republican who
might be elected just as well as to
any Democrat. The next President
must either go on with spending
more than the government takes in
| or he m u st cut expenditures dras-
; tically. Every one agrees that taxes
must and will be raised—probably
after the election—but rvo one believes
that taxes can be raised
enough to balance the budget unless
present spending is heavily curtailed.
So the next President will be faced
with the problem of whether to cut,
and infuriate the farmers, or the
unemployed, or all three, or to goon
spending, and scare the daylights
out of the folks who are worrying
about what will happen to this country
if the federal debt goes on
mounting.
This last m ay sound far-fetched
and academic to some readers, but
a brief confidential talk with any
shrewd politician m ay surprise
them. Ju s t a few days ago Secretary
of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau
J r . told newspaper men
that the treasury would not issue
checks after the federal debt had
passed the present legal lim it unless
congress changed the present
law lim iting the debt.
Im a g ine the debate in the senate
when that bill comes up! And the
newspaper headlines and editorials
about it!
Changing of Ships' Flags
Arouses Severe Criticism
There is no doubt that Roosevelt’s
foot slipped a little on that business
of perm itting ships of the United
States lines to change their flag to
that of Panam a. Actually the President
thought the idea was good.
Neither he nor Secretary of State
Cordell H ull foresaw the public reaction,
and apparently gave little
thought to what the world in general
would think. But, having noticed
the domestic buzz saw, they stepped
promptly away.
People are talking here about congressional
indignation and political
consequences, but the extreme
probability is that this will be purely
academic not only at convention
time, next June, but even when
congress meets in Ja n u ary . A lot
of water will have flowed under
bridges, meantime, and there will
be far less certainty then that the
idea had the President’s complete
approval than there is now.
Some of the criticisms of the plan
—which was perfectly legal, of
course— are rather amusing. As a
m atter of fact one of the most successful
shipping companies in the
history of the United States is a
fruit company which, back in 1909
—to go way back before even the
World war problems—was operating
a fleet of 76 vessels. O f these only
four were under the American flag.
Most of them flew the Union Ja ck
or the flags of the three Scandin*
vian countries.
They operated them under othei
flags because it was cheaper to dc
it that way. The present system ol
encouraging shipping, of course,
with w hat virtually amounts to federal
guarantees, makes the notion
of transferring ships flying th«
United States flag to other registriei
just a little cockeyed. B ut the present
system did not contemplate a
war. Most of all it did not contem
plate a United States law which
would forbid ships flying the American
flag to take part in the highest
paying commerce in the world—that
of carrying supplies to the belliger*
ents.
Will Leave Plenty of Trade
For United States Vessels
Actually, of course, ships of other
nations will be drawn to that commerce
by the incentive of profit—
insurance at high rates covering the
risk and being paid for by the customers—
which will soon leave plenty
of ocean-carrying trade for the
A m erican ships. United States
ships, in short, wiU do the least
profitable business, taking the
places of ships of other nations attracted
to the more profitable trade.
That is a ll right with congress.
H ad there been a vote on that sim ple
proposition alone, unencumbered
by the arm s embargo repeal, the
vote for it would have been ten to
one. But it is a little tough on the
men who were trying to build up
an Am erican merchant marine.
But what the President really was
interested in was not to provide cargoes
for United States ships, but to
insure a steady flow across the Atlantic
of American-made planes,
tools, munitions and supplies of all
sorts, from cotton to guns.
As a m atte r of fact he would have
greatly preferred to have congress
go back to international law, and
took the “ cash and carry” provisions
only because he had to in order
to get the arm s embargo repealed.
Rig ht now a new plan for a steady
flow of w ar supplies is being worked
out. What it will be nobody knows
as this is written but it will be
done. The administration is resourceful.
Remember how the AAA
changed into a soil conservation
project after the Supreme court decision?
The advisers cap ab le of
solving that legal knot are not going
to be stumped by the failure of the
plan to hoist the flag of P a n am a oa
the United States Lines boats.
Garner Real Candidate for
Presidential Nomination
It has been a long tim e since there
has been any real doubt that John
Nance G arner would be a real candidate
for the Democratic presidential
nom ination at the national convention
next June, and in some of
the prim aries to be held in the
spring. Yet so little had been heard
about his candidacy for the period
including the extra session of congress,
and the hectic war news
which preceded it that some had
assumed the G arner candidacy had
died a natu ral death.
Garner has two tremendous elements
of strength—will have three
if President Roosevelt gives h im his
blessing instead of fighting to nominate
himself or some one more
openly New Deal in economics and
associations. First, G arner has,
for reasons which can De assumed
since there is little doubt of the
accuracy of the general statement,
a very wide public confidence.
The second element of strength
possessed by Garner is the friendship
and confidence of most of the
Democratic politicians. This was
| never better demonstrated than in
the house of representatives in the
neutrality fight in the special session
of congress. Garner virtually took
over the direction of that fight, and
by his personal influence turned
w’hat m ig h t have been a very bad
situation from the adm inistration’s
standpoint into a real victory.
Garner Sensed Situation
And Went to Work Himself
G arner sensed that situation even
before the newspaper men began to
count noses—to add polls of this
delegation to those of that—and find
out that the vote was apt to be d angerously
close. Realizing the danger,
G arner wired Sam Rayburn,
Democratic leader of the house, to
hurry back from Texas and get on
the job. Then he went to work h im self.
It was long association, inspiring
friendship and confidence which
m ade this so effective. But in the
(course of the nearly 40 years in
which Garner has been a factor on
Capitol H ill, hundreds of Democrats
have passed through the house and
senate, and gone back cither to private
life or offices back home which
appealed more to them.
There are lots of flukes in politics,
of course. But on the whole an electio
n to the house means a good deal
as to the influence and position of
the m an elected. This does not entirely
disappear even if he retires
to private life. Some vestige of influence
remains. Garner probably
has more friends of this sort, of
varying degrees of importance and
weight, scattered through the country
than any living man.
All this cannot be added up to
make the result that Garner could
defeat Roosevelt for renomination if
| the President went after it. There
is no way of telling how such a fight
would work out, though most observe
r s in Washington would bet on the
President. But there is a growing
num ber of Democrats im portant in
the party who hope the President
will not seek a third term.

By the time O ’Leary reached the
tent, Norwood was in an easy campch
air, cutting the pages of a new
book and smoking as if there were
nothing on earth to be troubled
about.
“That lamp ain ’t fit to read by,**
said O ’Leary. “ Y o u ’ll ruin your
eyes. The only kind o’ engineer that
can look after himself has a couple
o’ fingers missing, along o’ having
learned what engineering is! Let
m e turn it out. I ’ll fix it later.”
“ Come in. Sit down.”
O ’Leary blew out the lamp. Then
he sat. It was not yet night outside,
but it was too dark in the tent
for them to see each other’s faces.
“ Meaning y o u !” said O ’Leary. “ I
could have picked you off against
that lamplight from a hundred
yards away, aye and no one know
who done it.”
“ Talk,” said Norwood.
“ I ’m dry o’ talking. I ’ve a throat
like a baker’s oven.”
“ You shall have a drink presently
.”
“ Said the devil to the sinner! That
Bengali doctor’s sore at someone.
H e ’s scared. H e’s roiled. He’s up
to mischief. Like all them Bengalis,
he’s a mixture of too many different
kinds of education. He’s as
fu ll of spite as a scalded cat. He
has imagination like the toothache.
What he needs is an umbrella, to
keep worry off with.”
“ Did he talk to you?”
“ Did he!—Time to post the sentrie
s ?”
“ Stoddart is doing it now. C an’t
you hear h im ? ”
“ Yeh, but I know Stoddart.”
“ Stoddart has his orders. I will
go the rounds presently. What did
the Bengali doctor tell you? Come
on now, out with it.”
“ The way I managed him was
th is,” said O ’Leary. “ I was looking
in on Mrs. Hardiftg, cracking on I ’d
come to fix the plumbing, on account
o’ my hearing her raising hell.
She was doing a better job of that
than you or I could. I understand
she’s a widow. I don't blame her
husband for taking a chance on the
nex’ world. She has her things pretty
near packed, in about a lorryload
o’ trunks on the veranda. She
was cussing out the servants until
the doctor turned up, and then she
turned her guns on him. She demanded
her bill, and he remarked
she d id n’t owe him nothing. So I
knew right then, there was a cockroach
in somebody’s butter. I stuck
around, umbrageous.
“ What she said to that Bengali
doctor, mind you, I wouldn’t say to
a thief. He was trying to persuade
her to take some physic for her
stomach. And she wouldn’t. He
said it ’ud make her stomach easy,
and she’d be fit to travel. He offered
to swallow some of it himself,
to prove it was harmless. But
she said he could swallow the bottle,
for all o’ her. He said he was
trying to speed the parting guest,
and she said she d id n’t need no
speedin’.
“ I showed up, suitable respectful,
cracking on I hadn’t heard nothing.
And I said I was Captain
Norwood’s private servant and had
the Captain left his pipe on the
veranda when he called *his afternoon?

female talk, and what she sa;d about
you! She said she wouldn't put it
past you to have smoked your pipe
on her veranda, but if you had done
it she'd have kicked the stinking
thing into the bushes. Long and
short o’ it, she don’t like you. She
pitched a hundred-rupee note at the
doctor for his fee, and he let it lie
there. I followed the Bengali. I
overtook him where it was quiet,
and no shrubbery where folks could
scratch their noses poking into other
people’s business. I spoke reproachful.
“ I asked h im : ‘Doctor sahib, did
you tell that woman what she said
you told her about Captain Norwood?’
He came back at me with:
‘Are you genuinely Captain Norwood’s
servant?’ And I said if I ’m
not genuine, there’s less than sixteen
annas to a rupee. And when
he’d thought a bit he answered:
‘Yes, I told her. I repeated rumor.
I should not have done it.’ He acted
nervous. And after a minute, he
pulled out five rupees and gave ’em
to me. I looked noncommittal, so
he gave me five more. Then he
said to me: ‘W ill you De seeing Captain
Norwood? How soon? Tell him,
but don't say who told you. that his
life is in danger—tonight! Warn him
that his enemies have heard about
that bribe, and they will try to kill
h im . Let him look to himself.’
“ He don’t care a d am n about you.
But he's scared stiff o’ what might
happen if they killed a British officer
in Kadur. I figured out the
meaning o ’ that, quicker than you’d
take a snapshot. He's up to something
crafty. No knowing what. But
he figures he can get away with it
all right if nothing happens, like the
killing of a British officer, that would
bring a British investigation on the
scene.”
Norwood refilled his pipe: “ So you
think the priests intend to murder
m e ? ”
“ No.**
‘ ‘Neither do I.**
•‘If they did intend to,” said
O ’Leary, “ that Bengali doctor
wouldn’t know about it.”
“ Well,” said Norwood, “ you’ve
done nicely. You have a hundred
and ten rupees for an hour’s work.”
“ Not me. I ’m proud. I gave him
back his ten rupees. He’s nothing
but a babu doctor.’*
Norwood.found the whiskey bottle
in the dark. He poured a stiff drink
and locked up the bottle, gave the
drink to O ’Leary, and walked off on
his rounds to instruct the sentries.
O ’Leary waited for him outside
the tent. He looked as nervous as
the shadow of a tree that quivers
in the evening wind. Twice he started
to overtake Norwood, but thought
better of it. At last when Norwood
returned, he hesitated, and if Norless.
It don’t take long to get G u lbaz’
goat.”
“ I can’t afford to lose Stoddart.**
• T il bring that big baby back as
safe as if he rode a bathchair.'*
“ Very well, I will tell Stoddart to
go with you.’*
“ Why d idn’t you tell me
sooner?” ,
wood hadn’t faced him he might not
have spoken.
“ Still here?” said Norwood.
“ W h at’s on your m in d ? ”
“ There’s a m an I ’m scared of.”
“ Oh? Who is he?”
“ He’s an old acquaintance o’
yours.”
“ I asked: who is he?”
“ A man name o' G ulbaz.”
“ Oh, is that devil in Kadur? Why
d id n ’t you tell me sooner?”
“ Because I was afraid you’d go
after h im .”
Norwood smiled. O ’Leary grinned.
“ What I do,” said Norwood, “ and
what I don’t do are none of your
business.”
“ Yes, they are! Gulbaz ’ud kill
you. Then what? He swore to get
you, on account o’ that Poona business,
when you caught him stealing
from the secret files.”
“ Yes, I remember he was angry.”
“ You shouldn’t have let him off.
I warned you then. You said you’d
a good reason.”
“ It was a crazy reason.”
“ Remember you! manners.**
“ I haven’t any—not when you go
chancing getting bumped off by a
badmash that ’ud skin his mother
for the price o’ leather. You said
you’d catch him later doing something
im portant.”
“ Y o u ’re not to touch him. Gulbaz
is mine, saith the rule of the
game. I need him. As soon as this
little business in Kadur is finished,
we’ve a survey to run, eight hundred
miles from here, where there’s
a dark little game going on. And
your friend Gulbaz is the bell-wether—”
“ H e’s a pig and a snake and a
son of a—”
“ Never m ind what he is. I t ’s
what he shall do that matters. He
shall decoy his friends—”
Moses laughed: “ That swine
hasn’t any friends.”
“ He has three bosom friends and
a gang of eleven all told. He shall
decoy them all into one net.”
“ Says you,” observed Moses.
“ Don’t be theatrical. You may
go and talk to Gulbaz if you want
to, but you’re not to touch him. If
you get yourself killed. I ’ll pay that
priest of yours to say no masses
for you. You shall stay in hell forever.”
“ M ayn’t I have just one crack at
him ? I could make him a hospital
job, where you'd know where he is
and—”
“ I have given you a definite order
that you're not to touch h im .”
“ Yes, but suppose he takes a
crack at m e ?”
“ In that case, you’re to run
aw ay.”
“ Stoddart can't run. He’s too fat.
I ’d like to borrow Stoddart.”
“ What fo r?”
“ I ’ll need h im .”
“ I said: what for?”
“ For a witness. If I don't have
a witness, there’ll be nothing Gulbaz
won't do or won’t swear to.”
“ How long do you expect to be
gone?”
“ About twenty minutes. Mavbe
C H A P T E R XV
It had been an army lorry once,
but it had fallen on evil days and
was now a contractor’s truck, so it
looked suitably unofficial. The Indian
driver had been commandeered
by Moses and for one rupee eight annas
in lawful money had agreed to
go anywhere, lawful or not. Inside,
beneath the rotting and ragged canvas
cover. Moses sat on the floor
facing Sergeant Stoddart.
“ I thought this was all about a
diamond m ine ,” said Stoddart.
“ You keep your fat head out o’
mischief and let problems alone,”
said Moses. “ Tonight’s no problem.
It ’s easy excep’ the consequences.
We’re going to lose a good officer,
one way or the other, and the question
is which.”
“ You half breeds are all alike,”
said Stoddart. “ You daren’t say
what you think.” He stuck his thumb
in the bowi of his pipe and struck
another match. His eyes were inquisitive.
“ You don’t mean—”
“ I mean you’re a fathead. That’s
plain talk, isn’t it? Now it’s your
turn. You tell me what you’re thinking
about, plain words and no this,
that, and the other. Come clean.”
“ Everyone in cam p has heard it,”
said Stoddart. “ First I heard of it
was from a coolie down by the river.”
“ Heard what?”
“ Someone’s been bribed.”
“ And you believe it? ”
“ Long ago,” said Stoddart, “ I
gave up believing anything in India
except pay-day and where there’s
smoke there's fire. I ’ve known of
officers burning their fingers. If the
officer we're thinking about took a
bribe, he'll be broke for it as sure
as you and I sit in this truck. That’s
one way we can lose him . What’s
the other?”
“ He d idn’t take no bribe,” said
Moses. “ Me or you might take one
—you special. But not h im .”
“ They may have framed h im ,”
said Stoddart.
“ They’ll frame your picture in a
museum one o’ these days as the
champion fathead that ever came
even from England to look prtpeyed
at a puzzle. There’s three men in
In dia who can’t be framed successful,
th a t’s to say unless they frame
each other. One’s me. Another’s
Captain High-Cockalorum Norwood.
And the third is Gulbaz.”
“ Who’d want to frame you?”
asked Stoddart. “ You’re not worth
it. What's the other way we can
lose the C a p tain ?”
“ W om an.”
“ He’s no womanizer/* said Stoddart.
“ You ought to be a reporter for
the papers. You get all your facts
right. I said woman. A woman,
you fathead. One woman—half o’
two women. Can you figure that
one?*
“ Well then, what woman are you
talking about?”
"N am in g no names, she’s at the
palace.”
“ You mean Miss Lynn Harding?
I t ’s all over the cam p that Prince
Rundhia has her num ber.”
“ You seen h e r?” asked Moses.
“ Yes,” said Stoddart, “ I saw her
on horseback riding with the Prince.
She's a good looker.”
“ How close did you look?”
“ Oh, a couple of hundred yards.”
“ Are you b lin d ?”
“ I've better sight than you, you
d ru nkard ”
“ And you couldn’t tel), from two
hundred yards away, that that girl's
a good ’un? You want to bet? D ’you
want to bet your month’s pay
against m ine that Norwood hasn’t
made up his mind that he wants
h e r?”
Stoddart refilled his pipe with almost
supernatural patience. “ What j
are we up to tonight?” he demand- .
ed. “ Why are we here in this bloody
truck? Where are we going?”
“ D idn’t he tell you?”
“ No, he told me to look after you.**
“ T hat’s what 1 told h im to tell
you.”
“ All right. General Moses, where
are we going? To the Promised
L a n d ? ”
“ We’re going hunting a bribe.”
“ Who from ? ”
“ G ulbaz.”
“ How m u ch ?”
“ You may keep all you get.”
“ How much do you reckon we’ll
get?”
“ Twice half o’ what he thinks it’s
worth. We split it fifty-fifty, on ac- 1
count o’ your puritan nature and
your good looks and your gift for
not letting your head know what j
your brains are doing.”
“ What are we going to be bribed ,
fo r?”
“ F or our virtue. What else could 1
he buy? Mine ain’t for sale, but j
yours is. He wants it for the travelling
wax-works o’ curiosities he’s
taking along to tour In d ia .”
“ All right then, put it this way: !
why are we worth b ribing ?”
“ We ain’t ,” said Moses.
“ Speak for yourself. Whose money |
is he chucking away?”
“ You may bet your boots it isn’t
his money. Considering the kind o’
badmash crook he is, that has to
pay out money by the bucketful to
keep his skin on his back and his 1
line o’ retreat open, Gulbaz is close.
He’s so mean that a Scotch flea i
couldn’t get a living off h im .”
Moses raised the cover of the
truck and took a quick glance at
the narrow street. Then he lowered
the cover and spoke:
“ We’ll be there in a minute. 1
want you to get this, Stoddart. Try
to understand it. It ’s important.
G ulbaz has it in for Captain Norwood.
That’s how big a sucker he j
is. He’s crafty. But he hasn’t sense
enough to know that there’s two men |
in India can beat him. One’s me. !
The other’s Cockalorum Norwood.
Catch-’em-alive-o Norwood. One o’
these days Gulbaz is going to sit
in Norwood's net, alive and nasty. |
But not yet.”
“ Why not?”
“ None o’ your business. You’re
only a fathead sergeant. You know
nothing o' the inside workings o’
things. But G ulbaz isn’t here in
Kadur for his health, or for yours
and mine either. He’s here to get
Captain Norwood and moke a profit
at the same time. He’s got a game
on, and he’s got it all tuned to a
minute. That’s whjKyou're here.”
“ There you go ag a in.” said Stoddart.
“ Blowed if I understand you.
Speak plain.”
“ I ’ll say it slow,” said Mose3.
“ Words o' one syllable. If I was
alone, and if Gulbaz was ready, he'd
stick a knife into me. But seeing
that you’re along, and you a soldier
that has cost the taxpayer a
heap o’ money for upholding the
blooming dignity of His Majesty the
King, he’ll think twice about it. If
I was stuck in the back it 'ud be
a loss to the human race and a
bull's eye for Gulbaz. But they
w'ouldn’t even write it up in the paper.”
“ Not in the society column?’*
asked Stoddart.
“ But if it happened *o you, half
the sweating countryside ’ud have
to turn out for your funeral, m arching
slow, arms reversed, Dead
March in Saul. And after that,
there’d be an investigation, two
courts of enquiry, military and civil,
plus a headache for the Maharajah
and at least a column in the Bombay
Times embellishing the record of a
faithful Tommy A tkins.”

Mexico Reveals Many Interesting Varieties of Cactus
F rom Mexico come many interesting
species of the Cactaceae. Many
of these have been discovered only
recently, writes E. C. H um m el in
Nature Magazine. One of tha com paratively
new discoveries is the
M am illa ria hahniana, known as the
Old Lady of Mexico. This was discovered
in 1929 in Central Mexico,
where it grows in large clusters,
completely cloaked in long, fine hair.
During the blooming season it v'ears
a crown of pink or rose flowers.
Little less conspicuous is the crown
of red berries that is later pushed
from between the flowering *.ubercles,
to remain for weeks :ike a
crown of rubies on a white-haired
lady.
One of the most difficult p'ans to
locate is Hoseocactus kotsuhubeyanus,
which belongs to th t living
rock group of the Cactaceie. On
account of the shape of its tubercles,
it carries the common nam a of deerfoot
cactus. It has a large tuberous
root and the entire plant i« sunken
entirely in the ground. Here it is
safe from the eyes of tho collector
until blooming time, when the large
pink flowers that arise from thc center
disclose its presence.
Cephalocereus hoppenstodtil is
one of the rarer of the old man
group. It is also referred to as one
of the torch cactuses, as it takes
very little imagination to make it
such, when moonlight or late sunlight
finds a reflector in the mass
of beautiful white spines. In its
natural habitat it reaches a height
of ten meters.
Not less fascinating than these
normal forms are the strange shapes
produced when something goes
wrong with nature’s control of
growth. The red cockscomb found
in many gardens has been developed
through many years of selection
and is propagated from seed.
In cactuses such forms arc* especially
interesting. Whil* the cause
of this phenomenon is a controversial
subject, scientists agree that
in certain cases it is hereditary.
H ig h e s t V a c u u m
Vacuums so high that they cannot
be measured with existing gages
have been produced by a new technique
And equipment recently perfected.
The machine has no moving
parts consisting only of electric wiring
and glassware.
With Thanksgiving back of us and
winter ahead perhaps this is an excellent
tim e to ask ourselves some
searching questions—to be answered
just by ourselves.
Do we as homemakers really enjoy
neighbors and friends? As they
pass our house on our street do they
think of us with a friendly warmth?
O r have we, perhaps unknowingly,
allowed ourselves to be so busy, so j
concerned about the tasks of the
day that we have forgotten that aft- :
er all the biggest joy in living comes
because it is the privilege of each j
one to “ live in my house by the side
of the road and be a friend to m an .”
Let’s entertain then, but let's entertain
simply, informally, inexpensively.
And thinking that you might
like to do just this, I have collected
for you this week a number of my
favorite recipes for just such easy
entertaining. Please note the little
hints that are attached to each of
the recipes.
Spaghetti With Chipped Beef.
(Serves 4)
This recipe is particularly nice
for a one-dish meal when guests
arrive unexpectedly.
1 large (24-ounce) can cooked
spaghetti in tomato sauce
1 5-ounce ja r chipped beef
1 cup fat
Heat spaghetti. Frizzle the chipped
beef in the fat until crisp and brown.
Then place the chipped beef in a
border around the platter and pour
the spaghetti in the center. Garnish
with parsley or watercress.
Oven Fried Chicken.
(Serves 4)
Oven fried chicken is one of the
dishes that is particularly simple
to prepare. After ^
the preliminary
browning, all that
remains to be
done is simply to
put the chicken
in the oven where
it takes care of itself and cooks
beautifully until you are ready to
serve it.
1 2 or 3 pound chicken, cut for
frying
1 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
Va teaspoon pepper
2 eggs
V4 cup water
1 cup fine cracker crumbs
F at for frying
1 onion, chopped fine
1 cup cream
Dip pieces of chicken in flour to
which salt and pepper have been added;
then dip in beaten egg to which
water has be*»n added and finally
roll in cracker crumbs. Brown in
hot fat (1 inch in depth). Place in
t a k in g pan, sprinkle with onion, and
top with cream. Cover and bake in
a moderate oven (350 degrees) until
tender, approximately 1!4 hours.
Baked Stuffed Pork Chops.
These baked stuffed pork chops
are a favorite with any man. Try
them.
Purchase thick pork chops and cut
a slit in them from the fat side of the
^ chop through to
the bone. Spread
Inside surface of
chop with prepared
mustard
and fill with any
desired b r e a d
dressing. Brown
lightly in hot fat in a frying pan.
Remove to greased baking pan.
Bake slowly in a moderate oven,
(350 degrees) for approximately 2
hours, or until mp«t is tender.
Hasty Oven Baked Beans.
(Serves 6 )
And as for baked beans—try this
30-minute method and if you don’t
confess, I defy the guests to guess
that they are not home baked beans.
1 large can baked beans
V* pound bacon
Vt cup light brown sugar
2 tablespoons tomato catsup
Pour Vt can of baked beans into
greased baking casserole. Dice 2
or 3 slices bacon and sprinkle over
the beans. Add catsup, and then ■
cover with remainder of baked j
beans. Sprinkle with brown sugar, j
and top with bacon strips. Bake in j
hot oven, (400 degrees) for 30 min- j
utes. Serve at once.
Escalloped Potatoes and Ila m .
Guests or no guests this escalloped
potatoes and ham dish is deliciously
simple and simply delicious.
Slice potatoes very thin and place
layer by layer in a buttered baking
casserole. Dot each layer with but- |
ter and sprinkle with salt and pep- |
per. Add m ilk , sufficient in quanti- 1
ty to just cover the potatoes. Top |
with a one-inch slice of ham. Bake
in a slow oven, (325 degrees) until
both the ham and the potatoes are
baked to a stage of perfect done- j
ness, approximately 1 hour and 15 j
minutes.
My Best Chocolate Cake.
All the world loves a chocolate
cake and I suppose there are almost
as many recipes for chocolate !
cake as there are women who make 1
them. This recipe, however, re- j
mains my favorite.
2 ounces bitter chocolate
**1 cup butter
1% cups sugar
3 eggs
2M» cups cake flour
l/z teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons baking powder
1 cup m ilk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Melt chocolate carefully over
warm water. Cream butler thorj
oughly and add ^
I sugar slowly. Sepi
arate eggs, beat
egg yolks, and
I add to butter and
sugar mixture.
Add the melted
j chocolate.
Mix and sift together the flour, j
salt, and baking powder and add al- ;
ternately with the m ilk and vanilla j
extract. Beat egg whites until stiff
and fold into the cake mixture.
Place in 2 well-greased, 8-inch layj
er cake pans. Bake in a moderate
oven (350 degrees) for approximately
30 to 35 minutes.
Chocolate Cream Pie.
And speaking of chocolate—this
chocolate cream pie has that just
right combination of ingredients that
makes it neither too thick nor too
thin; too sweet nor not sweet
enough. Furthermore, it is Just as
great a favorite with men as with
women; with boys as with gi»ls.
2 1-ounce squares unsweetened
chocolate
2 cups m ilk
34 cup granulated sugar
Vi cup cornstarch
teaspoon salt
2 egg yolks
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 baked pastry shell
Shave the chocolate and place it
together with IVt cups m ilk in top
of double boiler; heat until chocolate
is melted. Mix the sugar, cornstarch,
and salt with the remaining
Vi cup milk, and to it add the melted
chocolate mixture. Return to double
boiler and cook, stirring constancy,
until mixture thickens. Then
beat tne egg yolks slightly and slowly
pour the chocolate mixture over
them. Return to double boiler ond
cook 2 minutes longer Add vanilla
extract and pour in baked pastry
shell. Cool,.ond top with whipped
cream to serve.

Letter From Florida
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Sanders re
ceived the following letter from their
daughter, Mary (Mrs. And. Ohlsson),
who is spending the winter in the
South where her husband is on a
building contract job:
Venice, Florida,
Dear Mom and Dad:
So you’d like to know exactly what
I think of the South? Well, I can
give you my present opinion, which
certainly is different from my first
one.
First of all, I ’d like to say that
when I first came down I didn’t think
much of Florida. But now I think it
would be hard to get me back up north
where you’re having cold weather.
Last Sunday. Andy, Bill and Ed
(our two Wisconsin friends), and I
went in swimming in the afternoon.
The day was very warm and the water
had a very delightful cooling effect.
O f course, all days aren’t so mild.
There have been several days when I
had to shut the windows. But the
postmaster told me that last Thanksgiving
Day her family went in swimming.
There aren’t any other amusements
at present. But when the tourist season
gets in full swing, the theatre in
Venice will open. And about New
Year’s Day the members of the Kentucky
Military Institute (300 boys
from the ages of ten to nineteen) will
come down. Every other Sunday they
give a program composed of military
exercises and the like. The people I ’ve
talked to have told me that it isn’t
an uncommon occurrence to have a boy
faint during the program because he’s
strapped his belt too tight. And think
of all the years men have accused
women of being too proud of their
slim waists!
But to get back to my opinion of
the South. The white people are so
courteous and always willing to help.
The man in the meat market must get
tired of seeing me come in, for I
always ask him how to cook the various
meats. If he doesn't happen to
know, he goes into the back part of
the store and asks his wife. Even if
there is a rush, as is the rule on Saturday
nights, he’s willing to give me this
added service.
You know, we always hear that the
Southerners are inclined to be lazy.
Really, I can’t say that I believe that
any more. They all seem so energetic.
Andy say?, though, that on the building
he’d rather have Northerners— he
says they’re more willing to work
hard.
The negroes take things very calmly,
and as we’ve always heard, seem
to have little money-sense. I can
usually tell (I pride myself on being
able to anyway) when a a negro has
money or not. When they have, they
spend it carelessly and buy all sorts
of unnecessary things. When they
haven’t much, they take their time in
spendng it. I ’m not saying all negroes
are of that type, nor do I contend that
trait is confined to the negro race. It ’s
p'mply my opinion of the majority of
the negroes I ’ve seen.
I enjoy the Southerners’ way of talking.
Some of their expressions are
unusual, to say the least. For example,
Andy told me what Dennis, the
negro at the Anchorage, said when he
told of killing a rattlesnake. He said,
“ Ah just run ovah dat li’l old rattle
snake wif mah lawn mowah.” “ Li’l
old” applies to everything and both
whites and negroes use it— li’l old
tub, li’l old spider, li’l old guitar
whatever the person is speaking of at
the time.
This is a rather scatter-brained
opinion, but I think this letter will
give you the general idea. When I se
you, perhaps, not until late March, I ’ll
have so many things to tell you.
One last thing before I end this letter—
I ’d love Florida for no other
reason than the Gulf. Sunset or moon
light on it are two of the most beautiful
sights in the world.
Remember I think of you often and
wish you could be here with me, enjoying
the mild weather.
Lovingly yours, Mary.
Toy Clinic
A Toy Clinic will be conducted by
the Lions Club and the Boy Scouts
The Lions Club will furnish all the
necessary equipment for the repairing
and the Scouts will do the repairing
and painting.
If you have toys that could be mended
will you please call Ray Peterson
or Rev. Hawkins or leave them at
Kusserow’s Store. The boys work on
Wednesday evenings and would like
to start on the toys this coming Wednesday.
This is a worth while project and
deserves the cooperation of the entire
community.
7th and 8th Grade New*
We are all pleased with our new
room. Maybe that's the reason for so
many good marks.
The tests are over and most of the
report cards are out. The honor roll
for this six weeks is Muriel Anderson,
19 points, Harold Bessette, 16 points,
Patricia Kersten, 15 points, Betty Vissers,
15 points, Charles Behnke, 15
points, John Larson, 15 points.
Everyone is happy. We won’t have
any more school until next Monday,
which gives our learned scholars a
chance to rest their tired minds.
The beautiful perspective drawing
which w'e have enjoyed drawing, has
inspired some to eat much more turkey.
Some do not seem to need more.
We are all busy on our Units. We
have made two, “The New Land,” and
“ Pastoral Life”. Our next will be
“ Life, Liberty and Pursuit of H appiness.”
We are also goin* to make a
scrapbook on “Wisconsin Forests,”
and this will finish with the study of
the beautiful Christmas tree.
The grade team is coming along fine
although they lost one of the two
games which they played, it does not
stop them, but gives them more fighting
spirit. We’re for you, so fight,
team, fight!
■:ll These Years. W h a t H a v e W e l e a r n e d ? — By Albert T Reid
W h at s the Answer?
By EDWARD FINCH

POLE HWE ‘STBIPES? I
T ONG ago. a barber served in two
capacities—barber and surgeon.
Hc "bled people"—i. e., when a man
felt sick he thought he had too much
blood in his system and he went to
the barber to have some of that
blood removed from his body. The
barber pole stood for the staff the
patient held as he was being bled.
The red and white stripes were for
the bandages used in the operation,
the white for the bandage used before
t h i operation, the red for the
dressing of the wound after it was
over. The gold ball at the top of the
pole represented the other end of
the business— the brass basin from
which the customer was shaved.

MONTAIGNE'S 'GREAT REGISTER1
IF E V E R Y T H IN G else that gifted
writer, Michael Equem de Montaigne,
wrote were to disappear, the
world would still be indebted to him
for his ideas on what he called his
“ great register."
Montaigne was a Frenchman who
lived and wrote 400 years ago. Now
admired excessively by a few readers,
he’s almost forgotten by the
world at large. But every time you
read an advertisement in your newspaper,
you do homage to his m emory.
For it was his idea that people,
who want to buy, need some place
where they can get
information about
the products which
others have to sell.
In Montaigne's time
the buyer had to
look for the seller,
the seller had to look
for the buyer.
Montaigne p r o posed
a register to
be posted where all
m ight see. Here the
owners of things
they wanted to sell
would list them. Here also those
who had needs would list those
needs. Buyer and seller would thus
be brought together.
It was a good idea. It still is a
good idea. Every time, indeed, you
look over the “ ads'* in your newspaper
you express your approval of
the idea.
Sellers tell yoa what they have.
Charles Roth
You save time and money because
you compare what one seller offers
with what another offers. You judge
which is the better value.
Norman Angell, the English writer,
wished that someone had advertised
more in England when he set
out to buy a horse scraper for some
farming operations he had on hand.
He scanned the advertisements.
No scrapers. He wrote a few m anufacturers
he knew. No scrapers.
Later he came to America and in
Chicago discovered, through an advertisement,
of a horse scraper for
sale. He looked into the matter—
and found it was made within 20
miles of his English farm .
That you have a “ great register’’
coming to you regularly, with the
day’s best opportunities to buy the
things you need, is one of the beatitudes
of living in America and in
these modern times.
You do not, like Mr. Angell, have
to fret and worry and search for
what you need. You merely open
the pages of the newspaper, and, Io,
there right in front of you, you find
a world of useful things from all
over the world.
The more you rely upon the
“ great register” of modern life to
help you in your buying, the more
you get from every penny you spend.
The best values, the best merchandise,
the best prices—they comprise
the contents of that useful, indispensable
modern version of Montaigne's
sound idea.

Immediately after Thanksgiving each year, America begins planning
its Christmas celebration. In every city and hamlet decorations blossom
on streets and in store windows. Merchants put their shoulders to the
li heel, jor December is responsible for one-sixth of the year s total
retail trade (see graph). On Monday, December 4, banks begin paying
more than $300,000,000 to some 7,000,000 Christmas savers.

"C a n you start the flre and get
breakfast by seven o’c lo c k ?" asked
the minister.
“ I guess so," answered the young
man.
“ Well, can you polish all the silver,

‘‘Say, P a rso n," said the young fellow,

“A Lightning Shave”
l _ r E L LO E V E R Y B O D Y :
*■ * Now this is the story of a close shave—the closest shave
Jo h n Pisano of Clifton, N. J ., ever saw in his life. If I ’d said
it was the closest shave I had ever seen—well—that m ig h t not
mean anything at all. But when Johnny Pisano says it he
speaks with the authority of a m an who has been seeing close
shaves a ll his life—and giving them. You see, Johnny is a
barber.
Johnny has been a barber for the last 17 years, but he says
he’d never had anything exciting happen in his shop until the
sum m er of 1934. And how come Johnny waited until now to tell
us that story? Well—you see, Johnny was just a bit skeptical
about us. Here’s how he explains it:
“ My wife,” he says, “has been buying your paper ever since
we were m arried, but neither one of us ever believed in contests.
We thought they were all faked. Then, my wife tried one and
won a prize, so we had to change our minds. Now she wants
me to try my luck in your departm ent.”
And now let’s take a look at Joh n n y ’s yarn. He says it
wasn t as terrifying as some of the stories he’s seen printed
in this column because it happened so fast and was all over
so soon. But just the same, it was a bird while it lasted, and it left
Johnny ih such a state of jitters that he didn’t want to do any work
for the rest of the day.
Back Door to Shop Brings Bad Luck.
Jo h nny’s shop has a front and a back door—the back one
leading to a pool room that is no longer used. That back door,
Johnny says, 1s always kept closed in winter, but in the summer
when it’s warm , he opens it to give the breeze a chance to circulate.
Johnny used to keep that back door open all summer long
during business hours. Nowadays, though, there are times when
he keeps it closed. The minute more than two small clouds appear
in the sky together. Johnny shuts it—and it takes a darned
good customer to talk him into opening it up again.
Jo hnny’s wife is a little bit afraid of lightning. She had often told
him about that door. She said lightning followed a draft, and that he
ought to keep the back door closed whenever it began to thunder.
But Johnny never paid any attention to her. If he had—well—then he’d

never be telling this yarn to us today. And take m y word for it, it’s
the dog-gonedest thing that ever happened to any barber while at work
at the tonsorial art.
It was along in the afternoon, and the sky was cloudy. There was
no one in the shop but Johnny and his helper, and they were thinking
about sitting down to a game of checkers until the sky cleared ond the
customers cam e out of their holes again. Thunder was rumbling in the
distance and coming closer with every rumble. It started to rain—and
just as it did, a m an came in. He sat down in the first chair and ordered
a shave. So Johnny forgot about the checkerboard and began working
up a lather in the old shaving cup.
Before the soap had begun to cream up, the storm broke.
The rain came down in sheets, and the thunder, which had been
a distant rumble before, now sounded like the report of a 16-inch
gun going off right alongside your ear. But that didn’t bother
Johnny. His wife m igh t be afraid of lightning, but he wasn’t. He
scooped up a big wad of lather on the brush and began rubbing it
over his customer’s face.
He spread the lather and rubbed it in. His helper was standing at
the window, idly w'atching the water collectrin the gutters. There was
another crack of thunder—louder and closer than any that had come before.
Im perturbably, Johnny finished lathering the m an in the chair
and picked up his sharpest razor.
Customer Becomes R igid, Unconscious.
Johnny picked up the razor—brought it down on his customer’s
face for the first long, sweeping stroke. Then, in the next second,
everything in the world happened!
Johnny felt a sudden, num bing sensation in his right a rm . A
bright light blinded him mom entarily, but as it died out a bit, he
could see what had caused it. A shower of bright, yellowish sparks
C OM IN G OUT O F THE E N D O F I I I S R A ZO R .
The next thing Johnny knew, the razor was wrenched from his hand.
It fell clattering to the floor. Johnny looked down at his customer. He
iay in the chair rigid—stiff—and totally unconscious. And Johnny stood
beside him , his face white, his whole body shaking—feeling as if he’d
like to pass out himself.
He stood trembling until his helper came and led him to a
chair. Then he sat, dazed, while the helper soaked a towel in
cold water and applied it to the face of the m an in the chair. In
a few minutes the customer opened his eyes. He looked around
the shop, and then at Johnny sitting in the chair, lie sort of
looked as if he expected Johnny to finish shaving h im—but not for
Johnny. For all the west of that day he couldn't hold a razor in
his hand. His helper finished the job he had started.
So now, whenever the sky begins to cloud up, Johnny shuts that
back door. And one of the things he and his wife agree most closely on
is that little m atter of lightning.

To Americans, there isn’t much
romance in wash day. It rolls
around regularly and necessarily
without any particular fuss. To people
in many foreign lands, however,
where wash day happens once a
year or so, the business of soaping
and rinsing and drying is a real
event that is closely linked with the
traditions of the past.
Among certain tribes even the day
of the week has a special significance.
Thus, Tuesdays and Fridays
are unlucky for washing, says
I the Mohammedan from Morocco.
1 Tuesday’s wash will shrink, he
claims, and the waste water from
j F rid a y ’s laundry may hurt the
“ jin n ” when poured into the dram.
! Saturday is a bad tim e, too, for
clothes washed on that day will soon
become soiled. Of course, a good
Moroccan must attend to his own
I laundry some other day in the week,
j for according to tradition “ he who
I does not wash his clothes, write his
own letters, or slaughter his own
anim als is an object of mourning
before his o w t i death.”
Among some Moroccan tribes,
washing is taboo at times of mourning.
It is believed that seriou® consequences
will result if anyone in
the village uses henna, antimony,
walnut root, or soap for several days
after a death. The nearest relatives
of the deceased must refrain from
washing their clothes from 15 days
to a year depending upon the law of
the community. The nearest female
relative must abstain from washing
her face or clothing until the period
of mourning is past. Her neighbors
then bathe her, wash her clothes,
and make her presentable again.
In pre-revolutionary Russia, the
peasant housewife who attempted to
cleanse her linen at Whitsuntide deliberately
invited bad luck. At this
holy time, the water sprites were
supposed to have sat in the forest
asking for linen to be washed, and
woe to the offender.

Events in the Lives o f Little M en and the top of the bay made it
impossible to hang the draperies
as desired. A 1 by 2-inch strip
of wood nailed next to the ceiling
of the bay and extending 6 inches
over the walls at the sides as illustrated
will solve the problem.
The cranes for the side drapes
may be screwed to this strip,
and the rods for the pinch pleated
valance fastened to it. The rods
for the glass curtains m ay then
be attached in the usual way to
the tops of the window frames.

TH E boiled down experience
of many grocers has proven
that a door swinging Into the
store attracts more customers
than a door that swings out. A
double acting door that swings
either way is s till better.

hard to open have been known to
actually send customers to some
other store.
Customers should be able to see
into a grocery store from the pavement.
Strangers who might become
new customers like to look into a
store before they enter.
The store entrance should be on
the same level as the sidewalk. Experts
in store arrangement say that
every step up to

pavement has in-

much as 15 per cent.
When the store floor is three or
four inches up or down from the
pavement level a sloping entrance
is better than a step.
Customers prefer to take steps
down into a store as against stepping
up to enter but a floor on the
exact level of the pavement is still
best because customers can enter
without extra thinking.
Light always attracts customers
and the brilliantly lighted store is
usually the busy store.
\ V /IT H the holidays almost at
hand everyone seems to be
giving curtains a thought. An enthusiastic
reader of Sewing Book
No. 3 writes, “ I have a bay window
in my dining room that has
always been a problem to curtain.
Right now I would like to make
pinch pleated drapes of figured
damask to hang from cranes to
the floor. I would also like a
valance.” With this letter all the
window dimensions were given.
The sketch at the lower right
reveals the difficulty. The space
between the top of the windows

New Discovery Aids in
Tracing Indiana' Origin
PA LO ALTO, C A L IF .- F u rth e r
support of the theory that the American
Indian originally came from
Central Asia was produced recently
| by Dr. F ranz Weidenreich, of the
Peiping Union Medical college at a
scientific meeting at Stanford university.
Dr. Weidenreich revealed the recent
discovery of bones of a family
of seven persons in the so-called upper
cave of Choukoutien, in remote
western China. Beside the bones
were remains of fossilized animals
and cultural objects which indicated
the group belonged to the Upper
Paleolithic, or Stone age
Three of the skulls, Dr. Weidenreich
reported, were so well preserved
that it was possible to de
*t ermine their racial affinities. The
I skull of an old man looked in general
like the Stone aue man of
Europe, but showed some special
| features characteristic of Asiatic
I races of today.
The Answers
1. ‘‘Furlough” comes from the
Dutch ‘‘ver lof” meaning “ for
leave.”
2. More than a hundred times
