PLAN TS TRO UT
There were many interested citizens
looking at an oxygen tank truck
load o f trout on the street here last

A peppier bunch of trout it would be
hard to find as they darted about in

so large six to eight inches long were

headwaters o f Robinson Mora Haymeadow 
Valentine and Perry creeks
all came in for the planting Chris Olson
was very much interested in the
fact that they were all planted within
four hours and that they watched for
a time and so far as he could see
never lost a one The temperature
o f the water into which they went
was taken and if it did not coincide
with that o f the tank they were not
put into the creeks Two creeks were
passed up on that account Mr Olson
accompanied the truck

made in French Tank Swamp and
Skutley creeks and in the Mike Olson

NORTH FIELD CHURCH
The March o f Faith and o f Works
during 50 years o f congregational activity
will be fittingly observed Sunday 
Oct 15 at the Northfield Lutheran
church The festivities will
include a Mission offering at the first
session 10 30 a m at which Dr H 
O Shurson o f Minneapolis is the
speaker There will be three sessions 
forenoon afternoon and evening Histories
will be read in the afternoon
and the evening meeting is dedicated
to a Confirmand Reunion The Ladies
Aid serves dinner at noon 
The congregation was organized in
1889 with meetings held in school
house or homes The first pastor
was Rev C J Helsem who served
several other congregations The Rev 
Gulbrandsen became pastor at a later
date and served Northfield together
with Pigeon Falls till 1895 when
Rev A J Oerke Pastor Emeritus 
Pigeon Falls was called He continued
his pastorate until 1934 when
his son Rev H A Oerke took over
the work and served until November
1938 Rer C K Malmin became his
successor 
The congregation had the misfortune
of having its church burned in
1914 This church was built in the
year 1896 but the congregation at
once decided to rebuild and the present
church a fine brick structure 
was completed in 1915 
Affiliated organizations have been
active throughout the years o f work 
The Y P S donated a bell for the
old church also a horse bam for the
churchyard and have installed stainglass
windows in the new church The
Ladies Aid has been active throughout 
having laid emphasis on missionary
activity This year the Ladies
Aid has made extensive improvements
to the church basement 
The fifty years o f service are
marked with steady growth The secretary
reports down through the years
show that members were added to the
church records at practically every
annual meeting 
The records also disclose that
members o f the church had to take
care o f the transportation o f their
first minister going many miles back
and forth also that the first minister
had so many churches to serve that
he could not come to Northfield except
on week days but since then
over a thousand regular services have
been conducted The congregation
has been active in Foreign missionary
work and has contributed regularly
to the church budget o f the Norwegian
Lutheran Church o f America o f
which it is a member The work in
Northfield and community includes
besides the regular parish work Saturday
school and Parochial schools A
fine choir adds much to the regular
worship as well as occasional programs 
It is worthy o f note that Rev A 
J Oerke who served the congregation
so many years will take part in
the anniversary festivities He is 82
years o f age and has been pastor for
50 years

NEIGHBORHOOD CE LEBR ATIO N
OF C O LBY GOLDEN W EDDING
There was a unique and interesting
celebration last Sunday October 1st 
o f the golden wedding anniversary of
Mr and Mrs Will Colby o f Trout
Run residents of that valley for all
the years o f their married life It
was held in the new barn recently
completed under the direction of
Mens Haugen o f this city on the
Will Horswill farm It was a fine
setting for an occasion o f the sort 
and the people o f the neighborhood
are to be congratulated on the success
o f their plans on making the
event an occasion to be remembered 
The wedding day was really September
18th but at the time Mrs Colby
feared that she would not be able to
stand the excitement o f such an affair 
Their family was all with them
for that occasion and last week they
had another family reunion at the
home o f their daughter in Madison 
The original plan was for the Trout
Ladies Aid to have charge o f the celebration
but it grew into far larger
proportions and although Mrs Earl
Horswill president o f the Aid was
director o f the affair in her speech
she expressed warm appreciation o f
the fine cooperation and help from
everybody in the matter and stated
that it went far wider than the members
o f the Aid 
Tables were set in the barn one
long one in the center aisle and one
on each side In the calf pens were
work tables and low tables for children 
Henry E Berg donated the
paper which covered the tables Fall
flowers furnished decorations A
large corp o f waitresses insured fine
service and the kensington dinner
which was served right after the
mock wedding had over 200 guests
seated at one time Beautiful favors 
consisting o f small gold and
white baskets with colored candy
were presented to each o f the guests
as they congratulated the bride They
were built up in the shape o f a huge
wedding cake The baskets had been
made by a group o f the neighbors 
There was much excitement when
a team and surrey drove up containing
the wedding party Mr and Mrs 
Colby and their attendants Mr and
Mrs Nett Hostrawser o f this city 
who had been married just 49 years
themselves on Sunday and who will
celebrate their golden anniversary at
this time next year Mr Colby was
resplendent in a cutaway coat Mrs 
Colby wore an old fashioned gold colored
dress made for the occasion by
Mrs Annett trimmed with black lace
and wore with it a big picture hat 
property o f the late Miss Carrie Pope 
She carried a bouquet o f gold colored
fall flowers Mrs Hostrawser wore
an old fashioned costume a little
bonnet and shoulder cape and looked
very fetching Following the carriage
and the wedding party as it
entered the bam to the strains o f a
wedding march played by Miss Merle
Halverson were the four little flower
girls Doris Odeen Phoebe Alice Hostrawser 
Virginia and Zona Lou
Horswill all wearing old fashioned
basques and hats and with long skirts
in colors Joe Capen attired in a
frock coat officiated as the right reverend
who read the humorous wedding
service 
Following the fine dinner on
which Rev Allison asked a blessing 
the guests were asked to remain at
the tables for a program which was
a very interesting affair Mr Capen
again officiated this time as master
o f ceremonies and made a very fine
job o f it He started wtih a short
speech o f congratulation and then
called on numerous old time friends
for short talks which were interspersed
with music by a trio composed o f
Peter and Hubert Hoagenson and
Perry Overlien with Mrs Hannah
Overlien at the organ Their music
was very much enjoyed John Bowen 
o f this city contributed some enjoyable
violin solos with Mrs Overlien
as accompanist and the final
number was a solo When Your Hair
Has Turned to Silver by Perry
Overlien 
Among those who responded to a
call from Mr Capen for remarks
were Nett Hostrawser Mrs Hostrawser
and Mrs James Noble o f
this city William Dietrich o f Owen 
Ralph Hostrawser A L Gilbertson 
Mr and Mrs George Dettinger Mrs 
Lottie Johnson Carl Stratton and
Rev Allison 
Readings were given by Mrs Etta
Burge and Aunt Lettie Horswill 
who recited Faith in a loud firm
voice heard throughout the building 
Mrs Horswill and Mrs Capen were
the two oldest guests both o f them
86 years o f age this year and both
of them have always known the Colbys 
Mr Capen by request recited
an original poem The Old Kitchen
Stove Mr Colby expressed his appreciation
o f the occasion and Mrs 
Colby who was the last to speak 
movingly expressed her appreciation
of the day o f her neighbors and o f
the occasion All three deserved appreciation 
It was a fine neighborhood
affair and one that will be long
remembered

A SCHOOL SONG
Do you want an all school song 
That is the question which is being
put up to the students o f Black
River High at this time 
All colleges and most high schools
have an alma mater song so why not
us It s true we have a number o f
school songs but we need one good
song for our own special alma mater
song You might even call it our
theme song There s something about
it that helps develop loyalty and
pride in your high school Have you
ever noticed at an out o f town football
or basket ball games the impression
it makes when the band strikes
up a certain song and the audience
rises at attention and pays tribute to
their school in song It s interesting 
Our school song would need several
characteristic qualities First we d
want one which would be general and
fit in with all occasions not just for
athletic contests If possible the
words should be original or at least
partly so although the tune needn t
be It should be serious and mean
something It needn t be long or elaborate 
Our state university song 
 Varsity is short and simple 
Now that we have the qualities of
a good song how about some action
from the st idents This would be a
particularly good project for glee
clubs or other musical organizations
to sponsor If several possible sor gs
are secured they can be submitted to
the student body to vote for the one
they prefer This calls for cooperation 
so let s all help Any suggestions
can be written down and placed in
the Oriole Box It d be rather nice
at basketball games this winter if we
car have the band play and we join
ana sing our own exclusive alma mater
song

TH E 400 FAN S
If you want implicit directions
where the best vantage point to see
the new 400 in and out just inquire
at the bank the next time you
stop in to deposit seven cents or draw
out ten There is a lot o f information
around that stamping ground
about the foibles o f the train and incidently
more or less about the same
qualities o f the bank staff 
It seems the fair members o f the
staff had derived considerable enjoyment
out o f packing a lunch after
work and relaxing as they ate said
lunch and watched the train whiz by 
The men around the bank got quite
a kick out o f poking fun at them and
then to stress it a little packed a
lunch themselves and tried it on their
piano as it were all under the unseeing
eyes o f said fair members who
were there that evening 
Friday s La Crosse Tribune had a
story on the men going to the train
but no reference to the ladies We
can t decide just whom the joke if
any is on but wouldn t be at all
surprised but what it is on all the
rest of us who have neither seen the
train nor had a lunch The Tribune
story follows 
The new 400 is the main attraction
for the local townspeople these
days with its new stream lines and
splash o f color as it flashes past 
Great numbers o f people come for
miles to catch a glimpse o f the smokeless
wonder which seems to be a part
o f another world 
Tuesday evening Harvey Richards 
Warren Jones Homer Richards Hilman
Olson and John Bolger after a
strenuous day in the Jackson County
Bank had a picnic supper packed and
went over to watch the 400 in It
was in and out before the paper
bags o f lunch were much more than
opened The bankers got in their car
and returned home

R J Vander Putten division electrical
inspector for tne Jackson Electric
Cooperative issues xor tne lire
prevention week warning has tile following
suggestions on electric hazards 
1 Lamp sockets which have broken
keys or have pull chains which no
longer work and sockets which are
coming apart should be replaced 
Same applies to switches that do not
make good contact and receptables
that will not hold attachment plugs
securely 
2 11 temporary extension to the
wiring have been made through the
use ol flexible cords and these have
oeen left in place to serve as permanent
wiring they should be removed

cords in the house for hazard
due to injury or wear This also
applies to the heater cords on flatirons
and other appliances Replace
plugs if broken 
4 Short circuits o f wires or in appliances

They serve as an important signal
that some unsafe condition has arisen 
Find the faulty equipment and
replace it before the fuse is replaced 
5 If fuses blow out when too many
lamps and appliances are connected
to a circuit it shows an overload 
Either a fewer number must be connected

shop at Black River Falls All calves
will be on display at 10 00 a m in

Sale will start at about 1 00 p m 
Hand bills giving considerable information
on each bull calf will be posted

on the pedigrees may be obtained
at the County Agent s olfice
or during the A M o f October 23th 
Complete pedigrees will be read for
each calf by Art Collentine o f the
College o f Agriculture as the calf is
led into the sales ring 
These 4 H club bull calves were
purchased from herds having outstanding
production records The boys
are only interested in obtaining a
fair margin o f profit after paying the
purchase note at the Jackson County
and Melrose Banks The Jackson
County Bank has offered their services
to clerk the sale Ask the clerk
for credit if you need credit to purchase
one o f these bull calves 
The 4 H club committee in charge
o f the sale submitted bids to seven
auctioneers in Jackson and surrounding
counties The majority o f the
committee members voted in favor of
 Red English o f Arcadia who submitted
one o f the two lowest bids 
Rural Drama
Marie Kellogg of the Rural Sociology
Department o f the College of
Agriculture has offered to spend two
days in Jackson county helping
groups who are interested in putting
on plays Meetings will be scheduled
in different parts o f the county on
Friday and Saturday October 27th
and 28th to make it more convenient
for a larger number o f people to attend 
These meetings are being
scheduled in order that more groups
may take advantage of the assistance
offered Groups are in no way obligated
to take part in the County
Drama Tournament It is hoped that
these meetings might help the different
community clubs homemakers 
and school district groups who are in
the habit o f putting on home talent
plays for local entertainment Groups
may send any number o f delegates to
each meeting A definite schedule
will be announced at a later date 
Rat Control Program
Friday November 3rd is the date
set for the county wide rat banquet 
Circular letters and copies o f the paper
will give the definite rat poison
distribution points in each township
in the county Cost o f the bait will be
35c per package 
1 What kind o f bait is it Each
package contains two kinds o f bait 
namely meat and fish The foods
are mixed with powdered red squill 
The baits are completely prepared
and ready to put out Full directions
are on each package It should be
emphasized that all bait should be
used at once the event o f the compaign 
2 How much bait do I need for
my premises The package will cover
the average farm house or store 
If there are many buildings or rooms 
or many rats two or more packages
should be used Each package will
make about 100 small baits 
3 Will red squill baits kill animals
other than rats and mice Red
squill is relatively harmless to human
beings domestic animals and
poultry Generally other animals will
not eat red squill baits and if they
do vomiting is induced and the poison
is thus eliminated To be absolutely
safe however keep the baits
out o f their reach 
4 Will cats that eat the dead rats
die Cats are sometimes killed by
tape worms contracted by eating rats 
The red squill eaten by the rat would
not effect the cat 
5 Will red squill bait kill house
mice It has given satisfactory results
in many cases but can not be
considered the best bait for killing
mice 
6 How long does it take red
squill to kill rats From 4 hours to
4 days usually less than a day 
7 How does red squill kill rats 
Red squill causes death in rats
through dilation o f the heart and
paralysis o f respiration Progressive
paralysis in legs and trunk is followed
by characteristic rolling motion
preceding death 
8 Where do the rats die and will
obnoxious odors occur following the
use o f red squill baits Rats usually
have time to reach their underground
burrows before dying and cause no
odors around buildings There is always
a possibility however that rats
will die in inaccessible places 
9 Where should baits be placed in
a poultry house The baits may be
placed behind boxes and boards leaned
lengthwise against the walls After
the hens have gone to roost the
baits may be placed in the feeding
troughs but the uneaten baits should
be removed before the hens start
feeding next morning 
4 H Record Books
Club leaders and members are urged
to send all completed record books
to the County Agent s office on or before
October 18th The record book
committee will check all books in order
that our county achievement list
may be completed before achievement
day No definite date has as yet
been set for the annual achievement
day when achievement pins county
awards and county fair premium
checks in the amount o f approximately
$1180 00 will be given out to club
members 
Dairy Feeds
Reassurances to the dairyman may
be found in the general feed situation 
Gus Bohstedt feeds specialist at
the Wisconsin College o f Agriculture 
indicates that despite the handicap of
a nervous market prices o f protein
concentrates and o f corn are not likely
to soar to extremely high levels
this winter He bases his assertion on
the relatively large corn flax and
soybean crops this year 
O f com he says that the country
as a whole has harvested a good crop 
In addition there is also a large carryover 
While the small grain crop is
below normal and the Wisconsin
com crop is said to be four per cent
below that o f last year corn prices
should not be excessively high this
winter 
A record crop o f soybeans suggests
that protein concentrate prices will
not go to a high level he feels Many
I Wisconsin farmers have also grown
 soybeans which they expect to thresh
j or to run through a hammer mill for
j home feeding 
The threshed ground beans them 
 selves are worth nearly as much as
j soybean oil meal ton for ton when
I fed to dairy cows Bohstedt says He
warns however that feeding the raw
beans to pigs will produce soft pork 
Soybean oil meal on the other hand
is splendid for pigs 
Larger supplies o f linseed meal are
also probable this year he indicates 
The 1939 flax crop in Wisconsin is
said to be double the average o f recent
years 
While cottonseed meal very likely
will not be as abundant as last year 
there appears to be no shortage in
the rest o f the protein concentrate
feeds 
Regarding roughages Bohstedt refers
to a hay crop fully average in
spite o f the dry weather in Wisconsin
since June Contrary to the experience
of a year ago this season
has been favorable for harvesting
soybeans and other late summer hay
crops Silo filling weather has been
most favorable 
Pastures have been short on account
o f continued dry weather Many
farmers therefore are feeding green
corn silage or hay which o f course 
makes inroads into the supply of
roughages for winter

P A HEM MY ON LEG ISLATU R E
The Legislature has finally adjourned
without having passed an adequate
tax bill 
It is understood that the governor
will call the Legislature for a special
session in the near future otherwise
the state must cease to meet its obligations 
It would be a serious
state o f affairs if the state would
default in its obligations 
Jackson county its city villages 
towns and school districts are entitled
to receive $150 000 00 from the state
and this amount does not include aids
from the gasoline and auto license
fund Failure to receive this allotment
would seriously cripple our activities
and probably close some of
our schools and would materially affect
our tax problem 
It is therefore evident that this
state o f affairs will affect every county 
every municipality and every
person in the state and should be
given very serious consideration 
I will not at this time criticize
any person or party for this state
of affairs and knowing as I do how
adversely it will affect the entire
state I shall endeavor to do all I can
to solve the problem 
For almost four months the administration
has wrestled with various
tax measures and finally admitted its
inability to satisfactorily cope with
the situation and finally supported a
measure which created an inerim
committee o f nine assemblymen and
nine senators I have been elected
as a member o f this interim committee
and while I well realize that the
drafting o f any tax bill is very unpopular 
I also realize that the welfare
o f the state and every individual
is at stake 
This committee will meet in Madison
in the near future and will endeavor
to prepare a tax bill that will
meet with the approval o f the legislature
and the governor 
I well know that such a compromise
can only be affected if and when
all parties are willing to co operate
for the general welfare ot all concerned 
I am very willing to meet with any
person or group o f persons to get
their reaction on tax measures in
fact I welcome any criticism that is
honest and intelligent

L O C A L FA R M E R INSURES
PER M A N EN T W OOD SUPPLY
Through selective cutting and protection
irom grazing ol his larm
woodiot i arl Horswill Irving township
larmer has recently taken steps
to insure lor himself a permanent
wood supply irom his own woodiot 
Mr Horswill who has been a cooperator
with the Soil Conservation
(Service at CCC Camp Irving in a
complete erosion control program for
his farm since January iy38 said
that the protection and careful handling
o f his wood ot is a part of the
plan to control erosion on his farm 
1 he woodiot which is on a steep hillside 
is protected from fire and grazing
so that the trees have a chance
to hold the soil in place 
 Care o f the woods is a good thing
for these reasons he says and
many woodlands in our county should
have more consideration 
 There is not much forage in a
timber pasture the farmer continued 
 and I can see where keeping
the timber ungrazed keeps it in a
healthier condition and allows a new
crop o f trees to come in 
Now that his wroodlot is protected 
Mr Horswill would like to plant some
fast growing trees in among his oaks
to hasten the time o f timber harvesting 
He believes that There is a lot
o f land in the county that should be
used only as woodland When I see
a clearing job on this type o f land 
I would like to show the owner the
amount o f wood a five acre selection
cutting yielded for me 
 I was surprised at the amount o f
wood I had for home use The woods
didn t look like it had been cut very
heavily either the farmer concluded

 Allspice is dead A queer name
for a cat but it was so named because
o f its many colors Four beautiful
colors so intermingled that this
particular animal was the talk o f
the neighborhood It came into the
home o f ye Editor when only two
months old last May It grew to maturity 
under our watchful care until
it was really a beautiful animal 
White gray maltese and yellow so
woven together and striped down its
back to the tip o f its nose and down
and around its body that it was very
attractive 
Sleek sheen and streamlined it was
beginning to show what cats are for 
Already it is known that two field
mice had passed because o f Allspice s
nearness It was playful to the nth
degree It had not yet reached its
full lady feline maturity so its full
life was cut short No doubt its ancestry
can be traced back to the pair
that came over in the Mayflower It s
life was cut short either by indigestion 
or by being hit by a car as
th re were symptoms o f either Yes 
 Allspice is dead but there will be
cats to the end o f time so why weep
more

The debate in the Senate may or
may not result in materially changing
the form o f the so called Neutrality
bill before it is finished The
question of Keeping America out of
war enlists the united interest o f
the public but the way to do that is
what is bothering many senators who
have not definitely lined up on one
side or the other on the proposal to
raise the embargo shipment o f arms
and munitions to warring countries
There are other features o f the bill
about which there is little dispute
such as that forbidding our vessels
to enter the war zones around Europe 
and that prohibiting our people
sailing on the ships o f belligerent
countries An attempt to have the
Senate vote separately and at once
on those two proposals was defeated 
The repealists recognize that they
may aid in the passage o f the bill
as is 
Then there is the cash and carry 
provision which after all is only
partly cash and partly credit as well
as carry Proponents declare it will
not weaken the Johnson act which
prohibits credit to nations indebted
to us many billions since the World
war Others insist that it does and
should that our country should be a
bit liberal with the democracies
abroad at such a time But 90 days
credit is not cash and that is what
the bill provides It is freely conceded
that it is the intention o f the bill
to permit Great Britain and France
as well as all other nations to buy
our arms and munitions on a cash
basis carrying the materials away in
their own ships and not in ours 
If reports are true those countries
have several hundred million dollars
in our eastern banks ready to pay
for war planes guns and munitions
as soon as the embargo is raised 
Just why it should require 90 days
to route checks through banks so
close at hand has not yet been explained 
The cash and carry provision
is bearing much o f the weight
o f the arguments as the debate starts
o ff It may sink the bill according
to some and if that becomes apparent
as the time for voting approaches
it is probable that the 90 day credit
part will be stricken out Instead
o f cash and carry with 90
days in which to pay it may come to
cash before carrying and cash before
the goods are even made 
As gold will be the basis o f payments 
if the embargo is raised the
money experts already are wondering
what gold may be worth in international
trade when the war ends 
some four or five years hence according
to some predictions Our country
has some sixteen billion dollars worth
hidden away in the Kentucky hills 
more than half o f which has been
purchased at $35 per ounce and is
so valued in the daily reports o f our
Treasury England and France have
nearly all the rest o f the yellow metal 
probably with a purchasing power
o f eight billions at our valuation All
the rest o f the world has less than a
billion If the allied countries send
all their gold here to win the war 
there won t be much left elsewhere 
With a big stock on hand and nobody
to trade it with the price according
to the experts might drop
by some 40 per cent or more And
then what Nobody seems to know 
but what to do with the gold is only
one o f many problems which the war
will leave behind for us

Squaw Creek Ladies Aid will be
held at the Matt O Peterson home
Friday afternoon o f this week The
public is invited 
Pork chops butter and eggs would
seem to gauge the cost o f living if
one were to believe some o f the writers
in the press o f the metropolitan
cities The Secretary o f Agriculture
and the Department o f Justice as
well as the special Senate committee
are carefully watching the markets
to determine if thei e is profiteering
going on with the idea o f protecting
consumers from being exploited 
Commodities o f every kind have been
advancing in price Copper and several
other metals have doubled paper
is on the way up and there is an
advance threatened in farm machinery
in anticipation o f larger farm incomes
if the war continues But pork
and dairy products come in for discussion
by the writers as affecting
the high cost o f living Would they
have us believe that only farm products
and their prices are affecting
family budgets 
Had it not been for our experience
during the World war it scarcely
would seem possible that the present
conflict abroad could so quickly divert
the attention o f this great nation
from its own problems to those
o f other lands No domestic issue has
been or will be settled by the war 
The farm question labor issues and
the principle part o f our industrial
situation are as important now as
they were six months ago Under the
rules laid down no other question
than that relating to the Neutrality
act will be permitted to come up in
coneress before the regular session
in January If one can judge from
the letters received the peonies attention
has been as completely directed
to the war abroad as has that o f
the government 
organizing its main force here and
by spring will engage 7 000 employees 
Under the law and the order of
the president the appointments are
being made from the eligible lists of
the Civil Service Commission Plans
for the field work are said to be incomplete 
State and district supervisors
will be appointed first and probably
there will be no selection of
enumerators before January or February 
It is said that the Bureau
planned on obtaining its full forces
from the Civil Service lists also but
more recent reports are to the effect
that the appointments will be made
under the patronage system controlled
by the administration senators
or party chairmen as was done in
1930 It is possible that no very exact
information regarding the appointment
o f field forces and enumerators
will be available for a month
or six weeks There will be about
500 district supervisors and 121 000
enumerators employed when the real
work starts in April 
MERLIN HULL 
Although the House is in recess as
the debate starts in the Senate and
onlv two sessions are held each week 
nobody should gain the idea that the
members are havinsr a vacation On
the contrary the office work and departmental
calls have greatly increased
in volume Hundreds of letters
pour in daily and office forces
are as busy as the members Not all
the letters are upon the Neutrality
issue but many o f them are Some
members have received thousands o f
letters and telegrams expressing the
sentiment o f their constituents while
others have been less favored The
special session may last a month
longer and there is no pro=oect o f
the mails growing lighter The senators
are receiving the lartrer mail
with state wide constituencies hut
when the bill comes to the House the
volume o f letters probably will be
the laivest ever knbwn and in recent
years there have been numerous instances
o f postal avalanches 
There are numerous inquiries as
to the appointment o f supervisors 
enumerators and others who will take
the 1940 Census The bureau now is

A series o f six weeks examinations
are being given this week to all
classes in Hixton High It will prove
to be a sort o f trial and error test to
quite a majority a pure guess and
miss to a lesser group and to a
choice few who fool the instructors
by actually studying seriously a
walk away easy as pie 
Exciting times are in store for the
Hixton schools and their baseball
team The big tie up seems to be
centered somewhere between Alma
Center and Hixton Each team has
suffered one defeat and has won a
victory over the other The fine
sportsmanship shown by the Alma
Center coach Charlie Birch really
deserves credit Coach Hovey of
Hixton has proven to be a fine inspiration
for the fighting spirit o f the
boys on the diamond If you don t
believe me just attend the next game
and watch Vic Johnson and some o f
the other boys paw the dirt around
home plate before they lambast those
homers Rogstad has recently substituted
for the twirler Willy Jacobson
and shows a fine arm control 
and a clever hook 
Hixton High teachers will attend
the annual teachers convention in

Principal Leonard H Hermanson

and coach o f the coffee maker (Mr 
W hite) who insisted that trombone
