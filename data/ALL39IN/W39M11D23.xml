FORTY-SEVENTH YEAR WITTENBERG. SHAWANO COUNTY. WISCONSIN, THURSDAY. NOVEMBER 23. 1939 NUMBER 2
Increased Pension Bill Becomes State
Law
The much debated pension bill became
a state law this week following
its publication in the official state
paper. The state supreme court after
hearing arguments on the legality of
the secretary of state’s action in withholding
publication o f a partially vetoed
bill ruled in favor of Governor
Heil and ordered the bill published.
Zimmerman had contended that a partial
v^to after adjournment of the
legislature in effect voided the bill and
refused to publish it. Heil through the
state attorney’s office took the matter
up to the supreme court for ruling.
The court in a decision written by
Chief Justice Marvin B. Rosenberry,
declared that Zimmerman had no
power, either under the constitution or
the statutes to refuse to publish a bill
and thereby prevent it from becoming
law.
The question of Governor Heil’s
power to partially veto an appropriation
bill was not considered by the
court. The supreme court pointed out
that, “When the act is published and
the interest of some officer or citizen
is adversely affected by the act, that
question may be presented in a proper
case.” This has been interpreted by
many observers as an invitation to
bring the questions of partial vetos
by a governor after the legislature has
adjourned before the supreme court.
After the decision had been given,
Zimmerman stated that after the bill
becomes law, a test would probably be
started elsewhere.
Pension Increase?
Although the new pension bill has
been written into law, there is still
considerable question as to how much
it will mean to the old age recipient in
Wisconsin. It certainly will not mean
that there will be a $10 increase in
monthly old age pension allowances.
Pension department officials at the
time of the passage of the act estimated
that they would be able to increase
pensions in the state about
$2.50 per month. However, failure of
the legislature to provide sufficient
funds for balancing the budget and the
Governor’s veto of that section of the
bill which appropriated additional
funds from the state general fund for
pensions leaves further complications
to be ironed out.
One authority in the state capitol
pointed out that his interpretation of
the law is that in cases where investigation
shows definitely that a $30 per
month maximum pension is not sufficient
to care for the pensioner that the
machinery is now available to increase
that pension.
More old folks received, on the average,
more money in state pensions last
month than they did in October, 1938,
the state department of public welfare
reported Friday.
There were 48,709 old age pensioners
last month, an increase of 0,347 over
October of last year, and the average
monthly pension check was $21.54 or
$1.22 more than for October, 1938.
Thc state’s 42,362 pensioners in
October, 1938, drew an average of
$20.32, at a total cost to state, county
and federal governments of $851,090
In September, 1939, the number of
pensioners was 48,137, the average
payment was $21.46 and the total expenditure
was $1,032,958.
Special Session Out
Governor Heil, following the state
supreme court’s decision, stated that
he did not believe there would be any
necessity for calling a special session
of the legislature.
The supreme court’s decision rela
tive to the pension bill publication also
answered for Zimmerman similar
questions on the relief and omnibus
appropriation bills. These bills were
also partially vetoed by Heil and the
publication of the bills withheld by
Zimmerman. Had the court upheld
Zimmerman’s contentions and not
ordered the bills published it would
have been essential that the Governor
call a special session to provide relief
funds and to revise the pension law to
conform to the federal pension regulations.
The relief bill as it is now published
appropriates 5 million dollars from
the general fund for relief. Governor
Heil vetoed part of the bill which
would have increased the state’s
share of relief cost* from 5 to 10 per
cent.
Capitol Notes
Henry Gunderson, 61. Portage, former
lieutenant governor and tax commissioner,
has announced that he will
be a candidate for governor on the
Progressive ticket in 1940.
The state board of agriculture has
named William T. Marriott, Baraboo,
»s head of the new code division of the
department, and Fred M. Wylie, Madison,
as examiner. The new division
will have charge of administering fair
practice codes for the barber, cosmetician,
cleaner and dyer, and shoe rebuilder
industries.
Five Wisconsin deer have been taken
this year by bow and arrow hunters,
the conservation commission says
Governor Heil has announced that
there *wil 1 be no special session in the
third congressional district to fill the
vacancy caused by the death of Harry
W. Griswold, Republican. The governor
said he saw no need for spending
$26,000 for a special election just to
fill the seat for the January session of
congress.
I t was a big day for Wisconsin’s
army November 8 as Governor Heil
appointed more honorary colonels to
bring his total to 100. One of the new
officers, Carl R. Ecklund, of Tomahawk,
is going to the south polar
wastes with Admiral Richard E.
Byrd’s expedition, and will place at
the south pole a small Wisconsin flag
given him by Governor Heil.
Boy Scout Bean Feed
The Hawk Patrol will be guests on
Monday evening to a Bean Feed given
by the Flying Eagle and Flaming A rrow

all Scouts and Scouters will be present.

Two Basketball Thrillers
Wittenberg high divided two excit-'

and Marion during the past week.:
Manawa returned home Tuesday evening
on the short end of a 16-15 score
and on last Friday evening at Marion ,
the home team scored the winning bas-1
ket with less than thirty seconds to j
play. Luther Mason led all four teams
in scoring with seven against Marion
and thirteen against Manawa. Both
games were marked by defensive play
with none of the teams showing any
offensive power. At Marion the second
and city teams lost their games by
scores of 13-6 and 42-19 respectively.
Tuesday night the visitors won the
preliminaries. Manawa seconds won
15-2 and the Leopolis grades won 12-7.

“The Magic Nutcracker’’
Thursday, December 14th, has been
selected as the date for the annual
operetta to be given by the students
of the Wittenberg Public School in the
school gymnasium. “The Magic Nutcracker”
by Jane Kerley is to be presented
at this time. This operetta is
based upon the music from an old and
familiar score, “The Nutcracker Suite”
by Tschaikowsky and the story centers
about the activities which take place
in the home of an average American
family just before Christmas Eve.
In conection with the operetta the
high school Mixed Choir will appear in
a candlelight concert of Christmas
carols.
Because of the extensive planning
and preparation on the part of students
and teachers and the cooperation
of the parents in making costumes, we
urge the public to attend this Christmas
program. Tickets may be obtained
either from students or at the door.
First curtain will go up promptly at
7:45.
Disappointing Crowd
Wittenberg High school has a good
basketball team this year and although
they will not win every game,
every one will be exciting. They are
worthy of better support. Tuesday’s
attendance showed 32 adult admisAlumni
Meeting
WHS alumni will meet in the gym

game. All alumni as well as the class
representatives listed in this paper

SURVEY OF HISTORICAL
CHURCH RECORDS UNDER
WAY IN SHAWANO COUNTY
C. F. Clock, whose home is in Bonduel,
has been spending several days
in this community as Shawano County
Research Field Worker of the Bibliographical
Inventory of Churches for
the Wisconsin Historical Record Survey.
In this capacity he is seeking to
inventory the records of all churches,
existing as well as defunct, that have
been organized within the county, and
all this information regarding the
churches will later be assembled into
a condensed form for distribution and
general use for writers, historians,
and students of religious history.
The Survey also plans to have the
bibliography list all higher organizations
within the state, such as dioceses
conferences, presbyteries, and synods,
together with the records of any dependent
institution, such as schools,
hospitals, orphanages or other institutions
supported or controlled by any
of the above mentioned church organizations.
This attempt to discover and preserve
the information about churches
will be a worthwhile contribution to
the history of Wisconsin and the nation.

Fifth and Sixth Grade News
(By Billy Krueger)
Well, we lost the first game in which
the boys played in their new sweat
shirts, but we’re not disappointed in
our grade t»*am. They played the best
and lost; don’t give up boys, lightning
never strikes twice in the same place.
Both the fifth and sixth grade* are
! well satisfied with their school work.
! In the fifth grade the children arc

! and, boy o’ boy, would I like to mak*1
j the wages some of their characters
get.
What is this in the sixth grade?
1 Could it be that Arithmetic is racing
History to be the most liked subject?
I Yes! I t is, and it takes the lead.
| Arithmetic has the highest popularity
in both classes. The sixth jrrade students
are working on a different type
of a budget plan. Maybe by next week
we will positively decide what subject
I we like the best.
New Power Unit Installed
The Northern Milling company has
installed a new International power
unit for grinding purposes in its
warehouse here. The new unit is 56
horse power and its installation will
greatly facilitate the handling of the
feed grinding requirements of the
company’s many customers in this section.
Gerhard Johnson is the manager
of the company’s local warehouse.
I.arge Crowd Attends Rally
One of the largest crowds ever to
gather at the First Lutheran church
was present at the circuit rally held
last evening. Many were present
from neighboring congregations and
the services were impressive. It was
one of many rallies being held
throughout the state for the purpose
of revivifying the spiritual life of the
church.
Dr. Martin Anderson, Chicago, president
of the Eastern District of the
Norwegian Lutheran Church of America,
and the Rev. Mars Dale, of Stevens
Point, were the speakers of the
evening. The First Lutheran church
choir sang several selections.
The Rev. Adrien Olson, of Larson,
was also present and assisted the local
pastor, the Rev. Palmer Wahl, in conducting
the meeting.
Thanksgiving: Party Enjoyed
About 50 Indians gathered for a
very pleasant evening at the Mission
School house Monday. After a hymn
sing and devotion conducted by Rev.
Sihler, the evening was spent in games
and contests. Frank Storm drew pictures
of turkeys for the game, Mrs.
Wabshagain and Miss Lena Wabshagain
assisted in preparing the lunch,
and Mrs. Esau Pigeon and several of
the girls helped with the serving and
cleaning up afterwards Everyone enjoyed
the Thanksgiving party.
Truck Wrar Ends
Wisconsin’s truck war with Minnesota
has been ended with the reaching
of a tentative agreement which allows
trucks from each state to enter the
other state without licenses from that
state if they do not go beyond the
limits of a city or village near the
state boundary line. They may go
beyond such limits if the jjross weight
does not exceed 8,000 pounds.
The “war” started some time ago
when officials of the Wisconsin motor
vehicle division ordered the arrest of
Minnesota truckers entering this state
without Wisconsin licenses. They
charged that Minnesota had been al
ready doing this, thus violating a
reciprocity agreement between the two
states.
When officials of both states met at
La Crosse after having declared a
truce in the war, however, they agreed
that the difficulties had arisen because
of different interpretations of the old
agreement which permits drivers of
each state to use the highways of the
other without having to buy a license
from that state, applies to passenger
cars and private trucks not hauling for
hire if their weight does not exceed
8,000 pounds, unless they are hauling
dairy products, when there is n
weight limitation; other vehicles haul
ing for hire which do not go beyond
the limits of a ctiy or village near the
state line.

EUROPE:
Dutch Episode
**Glueck muss der Mensch haben."
“ A fellow has to have luck," commented
Adolf Hitler when he escaped
the Munich beer hall explosion
by 20 minutes. But the allies
wondered if it was luck. So hysterical
were the Nazi cries of British
conspiracy that many an observer
on the opposite side of the fence
called it a cunning plan- like the
1933 Reichstag fire—to weld German
opinion. In Britain, where anti-Communist
Nazis were blamed for the
incident, Hitler’s yells served only to
unite the empire in its vow to "free
Europe.”
Any hope for peace went dwindling
when Winston Churchill, first
lord of the admiralty, made the
most vitriolic attack on record: “ I
will not attempt to prophesy whether
the frenzy of a cornered m aniac
will drive Herr Hitler into the worst
of all his crimes but I will say without
doubt that the fate of Holland

and Belgium, like that of Poland,
Czecho-Slovakia and Austria, will be
decided by a victory of the British
. . . and the French . . . "
Only an hour earlier all hopes for
the Dutcb-Belgian mediation offer
(m ade a week before) went glimmering
when B ritain’s King George
sent a long and polite message acknowledging
the peace move but
pointing out that any further proposals
must come from Germany.

blockade.
Despite a German-Dutch border
incident and Nazi flights over Belgium
which were repulsed by antiaircraft
guns, the little nations remained
cool. After agreeing that an
attack on one would be an attack on
the other, they took pains to point
out that “ our mobilization stands as
a guarantee to all belligerents that
our neutrality will be maintained.”
Military experts meanwhile pointed
out that a Nazi invasion of the
Dutch lowlands would be foolish.
O nly possible advantage, and that a
minor one, would be to bring Germ
an air bases SO miles nearer
Britain. But by the same token
Britain could also violate defunct
Dutch neutrality, flying straight over
the lowlands to German industrial
strongholds instead of taking a
round-about route to avoid Dutch
soil.
II cstcrn Front
Twenty-one years to the day after
Armistice was signed in the last
war, German planes swarmed over
northern French territory from the
channel to Switzerland. That night
they made raids along the frontier.
A week-end of intensified activity
was climaxed when air raid signals
began screaming in Paris. When it
was over, the French admitted Nazi
reconnaissance planes had reached
within 28 miles of the city before
anti-a[rcraft guns sent them scurrying
for home out of formation.
| Though still spasmodic and unortho-
I dox, western front warfare showed
| precipitous gains which observers
j attributed to two blasts, one at Mu-
! nich and the other from Winston
i Churchill.
W ar at Sea
j Most noteworthy m aritim e news
I was the reappearance of German
merchant vessels in the North sea,
' defying B ritain’s blockade. Two
j such boats were sunk and their
crews rescued by a British war-
I ship. Off Singapore, in the F ar
! East, 20 were killed when a mer-
1 chant ship struck a mine, sinking
i in 15 minutes. Nazidom’s only con-
; tribution to the warfare was a
j pointless 1,200-mile bombing flight
to the tiny Shetland isles off Scotland,
where a few bombs did no
damage. Reason: There was nothing
to damage.
RUSSIA:
Finnish Sandy Hook
Said Finland’s Foreign Minister
E ljas Errko to a U. S. newspaper
! m an : “ I believe there is a place
j called Sandy Hook outside New York j
harbor. How would you like to hand |
j that over to some foreign country?”
This, he indicated, was the reason
! Finland refused Russia’s demand
! for a naval base on Finnish territory
| at the entrance to the Gulf of Fin-
; land. There were also reports that
Finnish-Russian conferees meeting
in Moscow were having trouble revising
the southern border between
the two countries on the Karelian
isthmus. After several days of this,
during which the Soviet press
warned that Russia would ‘‘find
ways and means of obtaining whatever
we need,” Foreign Minister
Errko suddenly announced the negotiations
had definitely ended. Europe
wondered what would come next for
the Russian bear was obviously out
of sorts.
DEFENSE:
Army  Maty
F rom Director John C. Gebhart
of the National Economy league,
the U. S. got as good a reason as
any why it should stay out of war.
Whereas our participation in the
World war cost 24 billion dollars at
the time, Gebhart figured the cost
to date was 57 billions. Moreover,
any future war would cost at least
30 billions a year and wrould probably
bring “ inflation and ruinous
taxation (which would) probably
mean a lower standard of living for
generations to come.”
One good way to avoid war is to
arm against it, which will be No. 1
on the congressional agenda Ja n u ary

DOMESTIC:
Neutrality
Disappointing to would-be U. S.
profiteers was the reaction to removal
of embargo restrictions
against belligerents. As expected,
orders for motors and aircraft increased,
but purchase of war supplies
was not large in terms of aggregate
export volume. Some quarters
expected orders to pick up later,
but any hopes for a boom wrere
nipped in the bud. Spectacular trade
gains of September and October
were no longer apparent. At New
York, Federal Works Administrator
John Carmody warned that only
500.000 of the
9,000,000 une

boats cannot sail in combat areas,

Among the first to cry out was C. I.

national m aritim e union.
W’ithin a few days the President
began ironing out this mess. Following
conferences with Joe Curran,
Maritime Commission's Emory
Land, and A. F. of L.'s Joseph Ryan
and Matthew Dushane, the White
House outlined three tentative remedies:
(1) Extension of social security
to provide seamen with old-age pensions
and unemployment insurance;
(2) absorption of beached seamen
in a m aritim e training program; (3)
absorption of others in vessels convoying
strategic materials from nonbelligerent

WASHINGTON.—Most of the New
Deal economists have not been optimistic
about business and employment
prospects for the coming
spring. They have heavily discounted
prosperity from war orders, insisting
that these will not be so great
as expected. Bi^t the chief thing
worrying them is inventories. They
insist that Am erican producers have
piled up tremendous stocks in anticipation
of popular demand, that
this demand has not increased in
proportion, and that hence production
must ease off. They are not
predicting anything remotely resembling
a crash, just an increase in
unemployment.
These arguments are pretty nearly
the whole case of those left v ngers
who have been screaming ately
for a new spending orgy I the
federal government It is on y fair
to say at this point that this i.esire
for federal spending, so essential in
the eyes of most left wingers, is
neither the chicken nor the egg in
this case. Some of the government
economists making this prediction
of spring conditions are personally
not in sympathy with spending
at all. They are holdovers—
not appointees given places at the
suggestion of the Frankfurter-Corcoran-
Cohen group.
But to the laym an, so ignorant of
statistics that he might have d ifficulty
understanding one of the
elaborate charts so dear to the economists,
there is much skepticism
about these gloomy prophecies. The
war orders are very tangible. They
are tremendous. They promise to
grow bigger. F ar from slowing
them down, sinking of ships carrying
the supplies to B ritain and
France will increase the demand,
for every cargo sunk must be replaced.
F or example, if a situation should
arise under which every other cargo
exported to Europe w’ere destroyed,
and continuation of this condition
clearly faced the British and
French, they would still be com pelled
to keep on buying, and to buy
twice as much as though the seas
were clear! They have to defend
themselves and eventually to w'in
the war, as they see it, and though
neither the British nor the French
will like wasting money, money is
not and cannot be the prim e essential
for a long time to come.
May Fly Pianos to Europe
To Avoid L-Boat Menace
Already there is talk about flying
the planes to Europe—from Newfoundland—
to circumvent the subm
arine menace. But it is obvious
that the more serious the submarine
menace becomes, and the more serious
the menace of Germ an bombing
planes becomes, the more airplanes
B ritain and France will need
—both to fight Nazi planes and to
spot Nazi subs.
Starting from that, and looking at
the whole situation with a cold econom
ic eye, it is obvious that Am erican
factories producing planes, m u nitions
and other supplies for the
allies are going to be kept pretty
busy. I t is just as obvious that the
people working in those plants will
have money to spend, and hence
w ill buy things calculated to keep
other lines of production occupied.
The very argument so m uch used
by left wingers as to the advantage
of federal spending—in that the dollars
spent keep right on circulating
—applies with equal force to this
w ar spending.
Besides, there will be heavy federal
spending, even though no great
new WPA fund or anything of the
kind is voted by congress.
Embargo Votes May Figure
In President ini Campaign
The Republicans are headed for a
lot of grief in the presidential c am paign
so soon to open if the old
m ax im of history, that one must
judge the future by the past, holds
good. The point is that an overwhelming
m ajority of the Republicans
in the house and senate voted
against lifting the arm s embargo,
while the Democrats, also in overwhelming
m ajority, voted to lift it.
The number of Republicans in the
house voting against accepting the
conference report—actually the final
vote on the embargo—was 141. To
these must be added four Republican
members not voting but paired
against it, which brings the total to
145. Only 19 Republican house
members voted to approve the conference
report, with one more, m aking
20, paired on that side. Thus
the ratio is 714 to 1. Whereas the
Democrats in the house voted 222
for the conference report, or for
lifting the arms embargo, und only
29 voted against it, a ratio of about
7*3 to 1.
It really amounts to this, that the
Democrats voted to follow their
leader. President Roosevelt, while
the Republicans voted to follow
their leaders, with almost an equal
proportion of each party bolting
their leadership on the ballot.
Now all this might readily become
unim p o rtant if certain things happened.
But the chances seem at
least 100 to 1 that these things will
not happen before the nominating
conventions next June.
Let us consider what these things
could be. First, there m ight be
peace before that time. But the
chances for peace seem mighty
s lim , and growing thinner every
passing day. To illustrate this,
some bets were laid in mid-September
that peace would come before
November 1, this year. The odds
were 10 to 1 against peace, but nevertheless
there were takers of the
long shot.
How Shrewd Political
Observers Dope It Out
The logic of those betting on peace
was that, having conquered Poland
and obtained all the objectives over
which the war started, Hitler would
make a reasonable peace offer, and
that France and Britain, hopeless
of liberating Poland, would accept
H itle r’s offer.
The shrewdest political observers
here believe that if the war is
still going on next June and next
November, politicians running for
office w ill benefit by having cast a
vote calculated to help B ritain and
France, and suffer by the reverse,
except in a num ber of congressional
districts so small as not to have
much national significance. I f the
United States should meantime
have gotten into the war, it is true,
the pro-embargo side might be able
to say “ I told you so,” but that
would not be very good political
medicine for a country in the fresh
fury of a war fever, sound as it
m ight be four years later.
Hear German Army Officers
Plotted Soviet Tie-Up
One of the reasons being given in
w’ell-informed diplomatic circles
here in Washington for the Soviet-
Nazi pact is the utter distrust by
the high Germ an arm y officers ol
Italy. Not that they distrusted Mussolini’s
intentions. What they lacked
confidence in was the fighting ability
of the Ita lia n army and navy.
Further, they regarded Italy as being
highly vulnerable to attack by
| B ritain and France. Altogether
they figured that, as an ally, Italy
would be a liability rather than an
I asset.
| According to these reports, based
on excellent authority, the high Germ
an officers had been plotting for
the tie-up with the Soviet for many
years. Some of the authorities
place the conception of the notion
in Germ an arm y circles as fa r back
as 1923. W. G. Krivitzky, in his a rticles
in the Saturday Evening Post,
has told his own conviction that
Stalin finally became converted to
the idea immediately after H itler’s
famous purge. Up to that time
he had doubted whether H itler was
sufficiently ruthless to stay in power
long enough to be a real ally.
The two theories, coming from
such widely separated sources, fit
together very nicely. Especially as
the reports about the objectives,
now accomplished, of the high Germ
an officers are that they did not
convince Hitler of the soundness of
their plans until just prior to the outbreak
of the war.
“ The process w?as very m uch like
water wearing aw’ay rock,” said one
of this writer's informants. "H it ler
did not accept the idea readily
at all. When it was finally put to
h im , after a long process of letting
h im hear this or that report that
the Ita lia n arm y would be of no
value, and this and that discussion
of how vulnerable Italy would be to
British and French attacks, Hitler
almost had a brainstorm.
** ‘W h a t!’ he shouted to the officers
at this particular conference.
Tie up Germ any with the Commitern?
Absurd.’ But he had been set
thinking about it, and pretty soon it
became obvious that no other course
could be followed.
“ What the British and French
were thinking about I cannot im ag ine.
But every well-informed person
in Berlin knew what was going
on.”
High Army Officers Kept
Pegging Atcay at Hitler
Every now and then, according to
this version, some high arm y officer
would be able to see Hitler
for some reason or other. Always
something would be said by the
arm y representative to Hitler which
would be calculated to make him
see the inevitability of the tieup with
the Soviet, no matter what its cost.
There was no need for sim ilar work
at Moscow. Stalm had been converted
to the theory for several
I years.
An entirely new twist on the whole
story has been brought back from
Berlin by well-informed Americans
with excellent connections since the
outbreak of the war. This theory,
not soundly substantiated but interesting,
is that H itler did not intend
to keep faith with Stalin w’hen hc
finally agreed to give his high army
officers their way as to the tieup
| with the Soviet. The essence of this
was that Hitler hoped to use the
I Russian alliance as a sure-fire stop-
! per to prevent Britain and France
j from going to war. Then he hoped
! to block Stalin when it came to de-
; livering. either in Poland, around
the Baltic, or in the Balkans.
But destiny moved otherwise.
Britain and France were allowed tc
get too far out on the war limb
! before they were apprised of the
> deal between Berlin and Moscow.
| So they started fighting. So appar-
J ently Stalin will get all he was prom-
, ise.i without much danger of a
j double-cross!

Lynn stared: “ Do you think I
could persuade Rundhia to try to
prove Captain Norwood’s innocence?*’
“ But Lynn dear, if Captain Norwood
has been guilty of taking a
bribe—”
Lynn interrupted: “ I don’t believe
Captain Norwood is g uilty."
“ But what do you know about
h im ? ”
“ Maharanee dear, what do you
know about me? How do you know
I ’m not a crim in al?”
“ Lynn—”
“ Maharanee dear, even if Captain
Norwood could be guilty of an ungentlemanly,
mean thing like taking
a bribe, it was 1 who betrayed him
and I want him to know it. If he
isn’t guilty—”
The door opened suddenly. R u n dhia
entered, followed by an attendant
in the M a h a raja h ’s livery.
“ Yes,” said the Maharanee, “ that
m an can be trusted. Lynn dear, I
will give him both your letters. He
will find Captain Norwood, even if
he has to hunt all over K adur.”
She gave the man emphatic orders
in his own language, told him to go
at once, watched him along the corridor
and led Lynn through the brass
gate to the women’s quarters.
Rundhia waited, standing. When
he heard the messenger’s footfall
returning along the corridor, he
opened the door, admitted him,
closed the door, held out his hand,
received both letters, glanced at
them and returned to the messenger
the one that was addressed to
Mrs. Harding.
“ Deliver that one. After that,
keep out of sight for an hour. Then
return and say that you have delivered
the other letter to Captain
Norwood. Go.”
Rundhia opened the letter that
was addressed to Norwood. He
smiled. There was no heading:
“ Your unkindness about what you
saw this morning does not make me
wish to hurt you in return. There
is something I wish to tell you. It
is important. I hate myself for
something that I said unintentionally,
under great strain. I can explain
it. Won’t you see me?
“ Lynn."
If we can blame his death on the
priests, that could be made to hold
water. The priests bribed him. By
this time, they probably know that
the news of the bribe is out. It
would be natural for them to murder
Norwood, to stop his m o uth."
“ Well, why not let them! Why not
leave it to them ?” the Bengali retorted.
“ Because they won’t do it, you
fool! Did you ever know a priest to
do a thing at the right time to suit
someone else? It will have to be
done for them. Now here’s the idea:
they keep a hospice where mendicants
may live as long as they
please, for no payment. There are
three men in that hospice, who
would kill their mothers and anyone
else for an ounce of opium. For
two ounces, they would murder ten
children apiece. You know my man
G u lb az?”
“ Too well. Some day that badmash
will turn on you.”
Rundhia smiled: “ Long before
that, dear doctor, he shall swallow
one of your prescriptions! Summon
Gulbaz. Give him money. I will
CH A PT E R X I II
The Bengali doctor entered Rund
h ia’s suite at the palace with the
air of a crook who is afraid of a
master-crook. He assumed an air
of self-importance that he didn’t
feel; of confidence that didn’t exist.
He d id n ’t wait for Rundhia to tell
him to be seated, and he began to
speak in Bengali.
Rundhia interrupted h im : “ You
m ay discontinue dosing Mrs. H arding.
Miss Lynn Harding has accepted
an invitation to remain here
at the palace, so the sooner the
aunt clears out of K adur the better.
Let her get well.”
“ She has refused medicine. I had
to put it on her breakfast food.
And now she won’t eat. She will
recover quickly enough! There is
nothing much the matter with her. I
am relieved. I do not like to do
such things to western people.”
“Could you get at Captain Norwood?”
"N o ."
" I think you’d better. Last night
at supper, Norwood watched your
clumsy by-play when you gave that
pellet to Mrs. Harding. The way
you switched the pellets wasn’t clever.
Norwood suspects you.”
“ Captain Norwood is himself under
suspicion,” the Bengali answered.
"H e stands accused, does
he not, of having accepted a bribe?
You told me to say so to Mrs. Harding.
And I did.”
“ Yes. I was coming to that,”
Rundhia interrupted. “ I thought the
news m ight influence her to keep
Norwood away. Now, lobk here:
officers caught taking bribes, especially
if they’re popular and well
connected, very often commit suicide.
Norwood’s suicide would be
appropriate, convenient and, in the
circumstances, not suspicious. How
do we go about it? ”
“ We don’t ! " the Bengali answered,
without a second’s hesitation.
Rundhia stared at him scornfully:
“ Well,” he remarked at last, “ it
might be dangerous to do. You and
I must be careful ”
The Bengali folded his hands
across his stomach: Very careful.”
“ Things mustn't be traced back to
us,” said Rundhia. “ There is nothing.
so far, that can be traced back
to me. But I have the goods on
you; and by God, if you don’t do
what I tell you, you’re in trouble.”
Fear looked forth from the Bengali’s
eyes, but he said nothing. He
crossed his knees and waited.
“ Norwood has got to be killed,”
said Rundhia. “ He is in love with
Miss Lynn Harding. He hates me.
He is suspicious by nature. He is
on the defensive. And he is the
type of person whose idea of selfdefense
is to attack with every scrap
of energy he has. That kind of person
is much too dangerous. You
and I can't afford to let him live.
"N o , Le didn't ask me to
promise."
give you three hundred rupees, and
you may keep the change. Tell
Gulbaz he is to hire those three
men to assassinate Norwood tonight.
I don’t care how they do it, and I
hope they get caught. They have
been living for months in the temple
hospice. Everyone will believe they
are in the pay of the priests. Do
you understand?"
“ I understand you. I won’t do it.
I have done what I have done, because
you knew of former indiscretions,
for which you could have betrayed
me to the law. And I will
do what I will do, because I need
the money. There it ends. I wish
you wouldn’t keep me waiting. I
am becoming nervous. I have
drugged his medicine until he needs
it five times daily. Now he is demanding
one at bedtime. Why
wait?”
“ Are you sure of the poison?”
“Quite sure. It is the same that
I gave you to test on the monkey
that you packed in ice and sent to
Delhi to be autopsied. It is a vegetable
poison. It escapes analysis
by all known methods, it is one
of five poisons that baffle analysis,
once it has become absorbed by the
blood. They will find in your uncle’s
stomach, if they look, some traces
of m ariju ana , which it can be proved
I that he himself bought, and which
j I added to his tonic at his own writ-
' ten request. I advise you to act
I quickly.”
Rundhia nodded: “ If you will at-
I tend to the killing of Norwood, I
will let you do the other job tonight.
But I want Norwood out of the way.”
mean to do it. If I could cut out my
tongue! But I said it. I can’t unsay
it.”
“ Lynn darling, did you promise
Captain Norwood not to speak about
those diam onds?"
“ No. He didn’t ask me to promise.
He took it for granted that I
wouldn’t mention what any idiot
could guess he hadn’t wanted me to
see. Captain Norwood saw me kissing
Rundhia. I know he did.”
“ Did he say so?”
“ Of course he didn’t. And of
course he won’t mention it, ever, to
anyone else. The man is a gentleman.
I don’t want h im to despise
me, yet it wouldn't bother me if
Rundhia did.”
“ Perhaps you don’t yet understand
Rundhia.”
“Oh, yes I do. Rundhia is a beautiful
savage.”
“ Darling, did you ask him not to
tell?”
“ I made it quite clear I was sorry
I had told h im .”
“ Well, you must remember that
you told him something that cencerns
the State of Kadur. You uncovered
to him the existence of a
bribe that might have changed the
destiny of Kadur by legalizing the
priests’ possession of the diamond
mine. I haven’t told you much about
the diamond mine. It is supposed to
be a secret. Do you call it a betrayal
that I have mentioned it to you?”
“ Don’t worry. I won’t te ll!” Lynn
answered. “ I never want to hear
diamonds mentioned again. How
long will it take that messenger to
reach Captain Norwood?”
“ That depends on where Captain
Norwood is. The messenger will
have to look for him. He has gone
on horseback. I ordered him not
to spare the horse. It m ight take
him half an hour—an hour.”
“ I can’t wait for an answer! I
wish I had gone in search of him,
myself. I haven’t any pride left.
His career will be ruined, won’t it? ”
“ But darling, he deserves to be
ruined if he accepts bribes. And if
he is innocent he can prove it.”
“ Do you believe that? I can easily
doubt it,” Lynn answered. “ I have
never once been able to prove my
innocence, against Aunty’s accusations.
Not one single once! Not
one time—ever. To this minute, she
believes everything she has ever
said against m e .” Then, suddenly:
“What is Rundhia doing?”
“ I don’t know.”
“ Does he like to be despised?"
“ Lynn dear, if you should despise
him , I don’t know what m ight happen.
Rundhia loves you.”
“ Does he? You think so? Tell him
I despise h im ! And I will, until he
proves to me that he has done his
absolute, utmost best to undo the
cowardly wrong he has done to Captain
Norwood.”
“ Lynn—”
“ Maharanee de^r, won’t you
please tell him? I mean it. He
might believe you."
The Maharanee sighed. She left
Lynn and walked out of the room
to find Rundhia
Lynn was seated in the armchair
by the window, staring at an illustrated
magazine, when the Maharanee
came beck.
“ Darling, Rundhia has promised.”
“ What did he promise to do? What
can he do?”
“ I mean that Captain Norwood
can be cleared of the charge of bribery,”
the Maharanee answered.
“ However, Rundhia made a condition.”
“ Maharanee dear! Tell me. Don’t
prepare me for it. I can take it
without our pretending it’;i something
else.”
“ Very well," said the Maharanee.
“ Let us be quite frank with each
other. Rundhia loves you.”
“ So says R u nd h ia ."
“ And I love you.”
There was a chill at Lynn’s heart.
As she walked beside the M aharanee
into the room, that was called
the boudoir but retained the sumptuous,
old-fashioned splendors of a
royal bibi-kana, she felt more selfcritical
than ever before in her life.
Not even Aunty Harding’s crudest
accusations had made her feel as
guilty, and as impotent to undo
wrong.
“ Lynn darling, why are you silent?
I can almost always count on
you for chatter when I feel despondent."
“ Maharanee, did you ever betray
anyone?”
“ Let us sit here by the window,"
said the Maharanee. “ Tell me how
it feels. Perhaps I can help you to
feel differently. You have helped
me in so many ways. There is a
law of compensation. Perhaps
comes now my opportunity to do for
you what you have done for me.”
“ I hate myself,” Lynn answered
“ You can't change that. I don’t
want it changed. If I didn’t hate
myself for what I ’ve done, 1
shouldn’t be fit to live. The dreadful
part is, that I can’t undo what I
did. Oh, my God—” she put her
head between her hands " —I didn t
" I can believe that,” Lynn answered.
“ Why else should you be
so kind? I haven’t influence or money."
“ You have personality," the Maharanee
answered “ You have imagination
and spirit. You can redeem
Rundhia. So that when the
day comes that he shall be Maharajah
of Kadur, he will be a great
man. Rundhia will do anything for
you—anything. Your influence will
persuade him to do good things, of
that I am sure. Even now, having
known you only one day, for your
sake he is willing to save Captain
Norwood. But he makes conditions.”
“ C an’t he tell them to m e ?”
“ He has gone in search of that
creature Gulbaz. Rundhia has taken
it for granted that you will accept
the conditions, since he has accepted,
as a command your wish
that he should help Captain Norwood.”
Lynn almost lost her temper. She
retorted: “ I was treacherous. So
was Rundhia. I don’t believe Captain
Norwood s been! I won’t
believe it until ® e y prove it.”
The Maharanee returned to her
subject: “ Rundhia insists that you
m ustn’t tell Captain Norwood whose
influence it was that saved him. He
demands—and I think that is fair,
isn’t it?—Rundhia can’t afTord to be !
compromised—he demands that if !
Captain Norwood should character- |
istically force his way into your i
presence, you will not answer Nor- '
wood’s questions.”
“ But I have asked Captain Norwood
to come and see m e .”
The Maharanee's sympathy looked
genuine. Lynn didn’t doubt it:
“ Lynn dear, Rundhia thinks that
Captain Norwood probably believes
you told about the diamonds because
you knew that Captain Norwood
was embarrassed by jtour having
seen them, and you wished to
punish him for remarks he had
made, in the garden, last night. Rundhia
thinks that perhaps Captain
Norwood won’t answer your letter.”
Lynn was silent for a long time,
thinking. The Maharanee watched
her, reading, on Lynn’s face, the
course of the struggle between
pride, humiliation, anger—and some
other, western emotion that not even
Lynn could have put into words. It
was too simple. Too elementary.
It escaped analysis. At last Lynn
spoke:
“ I promise. I won’t tell Captain
Norwood that Rundhia is helping
him. But will Rundhia do it?”
“ For you he will do anything,"
the Maharanee answered.

Bicycling Rupidlv Becoming Popular French Pastime
So popular has bicycling become
in France that the French railways
make up entire trains of bicycle
cars, the same as m ail trains, to
handle the more than 7,500,000 bicycles
now running ram pant over
the hills and dales, towns and countryside
of that nation, where one
out of every six of the population
owns a bicycle and stays on it most
of the time from the cradle to the
grave.
Increased production of lowpriced
cars, the vast network of
motor busses, reduced rates on railways,
have all failed to lure the
French, men, women and children,
from their favorite sport, bicycling.
And, where they go, near or far,
with them goes their bicycle, until,
literally, they crowded the passengers
right off the trains during weekends
and vacation seasons.
Bicycle vacationists go directly by
train to the center of the distant
region chosen for the tour and their
bicycles will follow by special train
within 24 hours. Or. by shipping
one day ahead, will be awaiting the
owner. After the holiday is over,
the bicycle can be sent back the
same way.
In Paris the visitor cannot help
but be amazed at the thousands of
bicyclists who weave their blissful
nately our modern up-to-date experimental
food kitchens are constantly
developing for all of us a large num ber
of brand new—good-to-eat, hot or
cold, bread recipes of the broadest
possible variety.
The making of yeast breads the
modern simplified way is certainly
a far cry from some of the difficulties
that our grandmothers or even
our mothers may have experienced
when they made it regularly—years
ago.
In the first place, yeast i i now
readily obtainable both in moist or
dry form. Furthermore we now
know that we can help to regulate
the rapidity with which the whole
bread-making process can proceed
by adding more or less yeast—more
if we wanl to hurry the rising—less
if there is no particular reason for
speed.
Then too, we have learned to
watch the temperature of the dough
a little more carefully
and we
know that if kept
at the just right
temperature, neither
too hot nor
too cold, the
bread can be
trusted to rise as
it should and to
develop, while rising,
the best possible homemade
bread flavor.
Then we have learned some modern
recipe adaptations of those never-
to-be-forgotten butterscotch rolls,
parker house rolls and cofTee kuchens
that our mothers used to make.
All of which brings me to sharing
with you now some of my favorite
yeast and baking powder, hot and
cold bread recipes. Here they are:

CH APT ER X IV
Norwood sat in his tent and
checked Stoddart’s survey figures,
found a couple of mistakes, corrected
them, admonished Stoddart and
gave the sergeant instructions for
the following day. Nervously he
walked the distance between the
horse line and his tent.
After the third of his pacings to
and fro, he sat at the table in his
tent and wrote a letter to Lynn
Harding, tore it up, and made several
more attempts. He tore up
the last one, gathered all the scraps
of paper into one heap, carried
them to a cook-fire and burned the
lot.
He returned to his tent, scraped
out a pipe, wrote another letter to
Lynn Harding and tore up that one.
It was getting on toward dark. The
Kadur River was a splurge of crimson.
He heard the hoof-beats of
O ’Leary's horse at about the hour j
when he had rirst seen Lynn Hard- j
ing in ihe Maharanee’s carriage, j
Norwood’s servant came and lighted
the lam p in the tent.

“ o r r r C on trib uted fit/ S pud
Whether one celebrates “ Frank's
Rivintr” Day on the 23rd or Thanksgiving
Day on the 30th with the Republi
cans is not nearly so important as that
one takes one day for Thanksgiving!
As a nation, how much we have to he
thankful for! Enough for our needs
and a country at Peace. More people
in the world today are hungry and in
distress than are secure and well fed!
But this week we thought we might
point out a few things in our own 1 ittl»
town of Wittenberg for which we can
be thankful; of which we can be proud
Here in Wittenberg we have twi
factories: a pop factory and snow
fence factory. We have had them in
our community for a long time and
are prone to take them for granted
But in winter how thankful we are for
snow fences and in summer — and all
the year for that matter— the refreshing
soft drink- from the Wittenberg
Bottling Works.
Two years ago now Mr. Axel Jacobson
and his son Thurlow turned a storage
plant for frozen fish from Alaskan
waters into a cold storage plant for
preserving meats, fruits, and vegetables.
What a fine thing the cold stor
age plant is and what a benefit to busy
housekeepers who no longer have to
can hundreds of pounds of beef, pork
and chicken each fall.
After the Jacobson’s started th«'
cold storage plant, Adolph Lorenz anil
his wife opened a bakery. Here in a
town numbering between 8 and 9
hundred people we have our own snowfence
factory and bottling works, feed
mills (we omitted to mention that w
have two of them), cold storage plant
and bakery. Personally, we feel the
Lorenz bread tastes better and is better
than any of the commercial brands
and for flaky pie crusts, delicious
cakes, cookies, and rolls, the baker is
in a class by himself.
Our drug store, furntiture store,
jewelry store, dime stores, hardware
stores, butcher shops, our grocery
stores, and our dry goods stores compare
favorably with the stores in
larger places and certainly offer one
as good values for one’s money. But
as if these were not enough, we enjoy
two shops where we can purchase at
very reasonable prices beautiful hand
made articles: The “G ift Shop” run by
Miss Ellenora Loberg, and the "Woodcraft
Shoppe” recently opened by
Clifford Bratz. We feel that we should
patronize these home industries and
encourage these brave and enterprising
individuals by our patronage. And
while we satisfy our practical needs
with the purchase of beautiful home
made articles, we can satisfy our
esthetic sense with beautiful flowers,
supplied by our own Green House!
When we consider the stores, the
home industries, the fine bank, and
improved school we have here in W ittenberg,
we can be proud and extreme
!y thankful. And as our hearts swell
with thankfulness, we have opportunity
to go to our beautiful churches and
there give thanks to the Giver of All
G«M»d Things! Let us not f"i*get that
no Thanksgiving Day is complete until
w«> have given Thanks to tho Lord for
His abundant mercy

By G E O R G E T. E A G E K
WHEN the youngest son of a
retail grocer went to work
as a filling station attendant for
a large oil company the father
little thought that the event
would increase the sales and
profits of his grocery store. The
boy had brought home a company
sales m anual to study in
his spare time and the father
in glancing through it found a
m o n e y - m a k in g id e a for his
own business. “ Keep the service
station clean,” said the sales
manual. “ Motorists avoid dirty, littered,
unkempt
stations. The one
and only reason
we ask you to
keep your station
clean is that it
m a k e s m o r e
sales.’*
The manual
went on to point
out that keeping
a place of business
clean is not
an occasional back breaking job but
more a matter of laying out a regular
schedule of work to be done and
doing a little each day with clocklike
regularity. “ If customers are
attracted by cleanliness when they
just buy gasoline, oil and grease to
go into an automobile,” said the grocer,
“ it’s a better idea for a store
where they come to buy things to
put in their mouths.’’
The next day the following schedule
was posted in the back of the
grocery store:
Monday—Wash and trim display
windows.
Tuesday— Wash and polish candy
and cake cases.
Wednesday — Wash delivery
trucks.
Thursday—Clean and scrub refrigerators.
Friday and Saturday—Busy days;
no cleaning.
First of month—Oil and rub down
floors, inspect delivery trucks.

“ The Color of Death”
He l l o e v e r y b o d y :
Y ou know, if Death can be said to have a color, most
people would say that color was black. Maybe a few of us would
pick red as the most appropriate hue for some of the more violent
forms of the thing. But to E lizabeth M urphy of Queens,
N. Y ., the color associated with death and danger—and adventure—
is khaki. And khaki it will always remain to Elizabeth.
There’s a doggone good reason behind E lizabeth’s way of
thinking, and that reason goes back to the days when she was
a girl in Ireland, living with her mother and dad. Back to Ju ly
6, 1921, when, if you’ll remember, the Black and Tan revolution
was going on in the E m erald Isle!
Maybe you’ll remember, too, that that was a pretty tough
revolution. The Irish fought a guerrilla warfare, and the E nglish
sent some pretty tough customers over to keep order.
All through that mix-up, E lizabeth’s fam ily ran a pub, or bar,
in the little town of Dingle, County Kerry, and on that fateful Ju ly day
two “ Tans,” as the British troopers were called, walked in and called
for drinks.
“ Tans” Start D rinking in Murphy Barroom.
“ We lived in the rooms upstairs over the b ar,” says Eliiab
«th, "a n d each member of the fam ily , from mother and father
on down, did his or her bit behind the bar. On this particular
day mother und I were on duty, mother behind the bar and I 011
the outside handing trays of drinks around. The ‘Tans’ sat
down and drank steadily, and after several ‘small paddies' one
of them begun to get obstreperous and nasty, and poor mother
tried to quiet him down by being extra nice to h im .”
But mother didn’t have much success with the fellow. She had barely
started talking to him when he began to get abusive, and then threatening.
And mother thought it would be best to change the subject. The

“ He grabbed me with his right hand and kept choking and choking.”
surly fellow was wearing a pair of brand new khaki pants and in order
to get his mind on something beside threats and violence she said,
“ You’ve got on a fine new pair of pants. That m ate rial would m ake a
lovely skirt.”
The fellow turned suddenly to Elizabeth. “ Would you like a skirt
made out of this stuff?” he demanded. And without thinking, Elizabeth
said, “ No, I wouldn’t care for it.” And the next minute she knew she
had said the wrong thing!
“ At the time I said It,” she says, “ I had no idea of casting
any aspersion on the king’s khaki, but this brave bucko (lew
into a rage. ‘So you don’t like the color, eh?' he shouted. ‘Well,
I ’ll make you like i t ! ’ ”
And the next thing Elizabeth knew, he had her by the throat!
Crazed Soldier Terrorizes Daughter of Inn Keeper.
“ He grabbed me with his right hand,” she says, “ and he kept choking
and choking, and at the same time shouting over and over again, ‘Do
you like it?—Do you like it? ’ without even giving me a chance to answer.
It would have done hinj no good if he had, for by that time my Irish temper
was up and I'd prefer to choke rather than m ake a sign that I had
given in to h im .”
But all of a sudden Elizabeth heard something that cooled
off that temper of hers. A revolver shot! At the same moment,
the second “ Tan” leaped up from the table where he had been
sitting quietly all the time, caught hold of his partner and made
him let go of Elizabeth’s throat. And then Elizabeth saw the revolver.
It was in the hand of her attacker. While he had choked
her with his right hand he had fired that shot with his left.
He had missed. The bullet had flattened against the hinge of the
door. But now Elizabeth knew she was dealing with a m an
in a mood to com m it actual m urder—and she was scared to death.
The second “ T an” was remonstrating with the first. “ Would you shoot
the g irl? ” he was saying. The first “ T an” roared, “ Yes, I ’ll shoot her.
I don’t care who she is !” Another argument was starting, and Elizabeth,
thoroughly frightened by this time, tried to smooth it over. “ I t ’s all righ t,”
she said. “ He wasn’t aim ing at m e .”
And again the wrong thing had been said. For the surly
“ Tan” whirled on her suddenly, whipped up his revolver again
and cried. “ You think so? Well, this time I won’t m is s !”
Then the battle started in earnest. The second “ Tan” grabbed
his arm and tried to wrest the gun from h im , and at the same time
he shouted to Elizabeth to run. “ And boy,” says Elizabeth, “ I
did run.”

there had heard the shot and wanted to know what was the matter.
Elizabeth didn’t even stop to explain. She dashed through that house
to the back door and out into the yard. And the neighbors, knowing
what sort of thing can happen in a country that is fighting a revolution,
ran along behind her.
There were three of them in that neighbor fam ily. Elizabeth climbed
the fence into the next yard, and they followed. That next yard led to a
carpenter s workshop, and the carpenter, and his workmen, when they
saw four people dash through his place without even a word of explanation,
decided they’d better run, too. Out in the street more people
joined in the panic.
“ There was quite a little bunch of us, all on the run together,”
says Elizabeth, “ by the time things quieted down and
Homebody shouted to us that the ‘Tans’ had left the locality and
we would have no more to fear from them .”
Elizabeth says that now she looks back on it, she can see a certain
amount of humor in the situation of half a town running because one
drunken ‘Tan’ had fired a revolver, but doggone if she could see it then.
“ I have always believed,” she says, “ that I owe my life to that Tan*
who interfered with the other one. And wouldn’t it have been awful to
have died all because of a pair of khaki pants?”

His career, from the start on
down to his present fifty-ninth
year, is a testimonial to occult
guidance, in planting him always
in the highway of Lady
Luck, ln Prague, his birthplace,
his father worked in a hakerv.
One day, his mother gave his
father money to buy wood.
Fates or phantoms guided him
instead to a pawn shop, where
he made a down payment on a
tiny piano. Rudolf's mother was
so angry she wanted to chop it
to pieces, but the boy persuaded
her to let him keep it. One day
the owner of the bakery passed
by, heard the lad playing beautifully
and helped groove him
into his musical career.
At the age of 10, he had published
a barcarolle. In the musical
conservatory of Prague, where he
studied under Antonin Dvorak, he
teamed up with Ja n Kubelik. They
were playing at a concert which
Daniel Frohman happened opportunely
to attend. He took them to
the United States for a tour of 80
cities.
Whether or not Mr. F rim l was just
an amanuensis for spirits, his compositions
streamed along rapidly—
i “ G lorianna,” “ The Firefly,” “ Katink
a,” “ High Jin k s ,” “ Music Hath
Charms,” ‘‘The Vagabond King,”
and a whole album of others, none
of them seeming to be of ghostly
inspiration. Hollywood still keeps

Europe after the war, he asks,
“ What of it? What is the difference
between communism and a society
where a tax takes h alf of the income
and a surtax the other h alf?”
He says the day of initiative
and enterprise is past, lie is
an authority on that subject.
Sixty-two years ago. he swept
out a store in Ripon. Wis. Two
years later, he was an errand
hoy for Marshall Field  Co.
in Chicago, and a partner uhen
he quit, in 1904. Punch ribbed
him mercilessly when lie opened
his store in London, and the
smart salons were full of clever
mots ahout the American invader.
He made them like him. lie
hired as head of his dress department
Lady AfHick, who had
thought up the cleverest jokes
about him.
Here in 1937, he was optimistic
about Europe and the world in general.
Now he says, “ The opportunity
to achieve and to show results
has been eliminated all over the
world.”

of interior, swings on the
French Reds with a spiked club. He
links them with the Germans and
promises to
sweep them i
from all “ vil- I
lages, municipalities,
cities
and towns.” And he means to do
just that.
M. Sarraut, as governor-general of
French Indo-China, was regarded As
a hard-fisted and implacable colonial
administrator. Returning to his
country villa in France, he read
Tolstoy, and renounced all belief in
force. W'hen he became minister of
interior, his enemies, catching him
thus off guard, swarmed all over
him . He resigned from the ministry
and said:
“ I find now that I have no defire
to smite hip and thigh those
who do not think as I do. You
gentlemen take over the job and
tee what you can do with it.”
He again became minister of the
interior, but offered his resignation
when King Alexander was assassinated
in Marseilles. But, taking the
premiership, he again swung his
war club, hotly denouncing obstructionists
and meddlers. Alternately
tough and conciliatory, he is a veteran
of the rough-and-tumble of
French politics. A vacation, in his
garden, where he is given to reading
and meditating, is apt to bring
on the Tolstoyan mood.

Clom Small Schools
A new law effective September 1,
too late to function this year, is exnected
to cause the closing of 600 to
800 small, one-room schoolhouses in
the next year, says the department of
public instruction.
Under the old law every school, regardless
of the number of pupils it
had. received $2o0 from the state and
$250 from the county annuallv. with
$350 equalization aid if the district’s
assessed valuation was low.
The new law. however, amends this
to $25 state aid and $25 county aid for
each pupil if the average daily attendance
at the school is 10 or less, with
no equalization aid provided. I f the
school closes and pupils are sent to
another school, however, the district
with the closed school will receive $25
«tate and $25 county aid per pupil,
plus a $100 bonus and $18 transportation
aid for each nupil. Thus districts
with schools having an average at-
*endance of under 10 would be encouraged
to close the schools because by
so doing they would receive more state
and county aid.
There are 1,234 schools in the state
with enrollments of 12 or less. Enrollment
of 12 means an average attendance
of 10. It is expected that with
the new law about one-half of them
will close next year, with others following
suit in subsequent years.
