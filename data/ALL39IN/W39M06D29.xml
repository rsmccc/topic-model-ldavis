FORTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG. SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN. THURSDAY. JUNE 29. 1939 NUMBER S3
Latest Tax Version
The latest revenue bill to raise the
21 million dollars needed to balance
the budget plus four millions for relief
and another million for Bang’s
disease control was introduced into
the assembly in the form of a substitute
bill to the non-essentials tax bill.
A special order of business before
the lower house this week, the measure
eliminates some of the objections
to the former bill and proposes to
use seven and one-half million dollars
of highway funds.
The revised tax bill was rfrawn up
by the joint committee on finance
with the help of Governor Heil’s
financial advisers after the committee
had pondered protests against the
non-essentials tax and the broadening
of the income tax base.
The substitute bill eliminates the
proposed increased beer tax of $1 to
$1.50 per barrel, the tax on new automobile
sales, the theater and amusement
tax, the tax for tobacco other
than cigarettes, and also the plan of
broadening the income tax base to
include another 100,000 persons by
lowering exemptions.
It is estimated that the diversion of
highway funds will make up most of
the revenue lost by the above eliminations.
Taxes still included in the bill
are as follows:
Cigarette tax of two cents per
package.
Liquor tax increase of $1.00 to
$1.50 a gallon.
Wine tax increase to 25 cents a
gallon.
Reenactment of the privilege dividend
tax, and an increase from two
and one-half to three per cent.
Reenactment of the chain store tax.
Reenactment of the GO per cent surtax
on incomes and reducing the exemptions
under the surtax from $25
to $17.50 for married persona and
$8.00 for single persons.
More Tax Plans?
While the latest plan submitted to
legislators for producing the needed
revenue to meet state expenses for
the next biennium is the thin! that
has been given them, there are still
some legislators who believe they
have not yet seen thc measure that
will ultimately be adopted.
The first Heil proposal called for a
sales tax with rebates to local units of
governments for reduction of property
taxes. This plan was unanimously
rejected by the Republicans in caucus.
Although rejected the sales tax plan
still has a few supporters because of
its possibilities in relieving the burden
on property. *
The second plan, now substituted
by the third with the remaining nonessentials
tax and increases for present
income taxpayers is expected to
encounter stiff opposition. Republicans
would like to meet the budget
without any increased taxes if at all
possible.
It is reported that Senator Peters,
Hartford Republican, will submit a
substitute bill in the senate which will
wipe out all non-essentials taxes except
the cigarette tax and proposes
to take the balance from the highway
fund.
New Appointments
Three important state administrative
positions were filled when Governor
Heil named William J . P. Aberg,
Madison, to the conservation commission;
C. L. Miler, Delavan, to the industrial
commission; and August
Frey, Milwaukee, to the directorship
of the new division of departmental research.
Aberg, a Madison attorney, who received
a six-year term, is a wellknown
conservationist. He is a former
national executive of the Izaak Wal
ton league, a member of the advisory
board for the Great Lakes forest experiment
station at St. Paul, and past
regional director of the National Wild
Life federation. He has assisted in
drafting practically all the state con
servation laws since 1927.
Miler has been employed by the
Bradley Knitting company of Delavan
for the past 22 years, is chairman of
the Walworth County Republican club
and has long been active in party a ffairs.
Frey is secretary to the governor
in charge of purchases and was secretary
of the Heil for Governor club
during the last campaign. The new
department he heads has broad pow
ers to investigate state departments
and make recommendations to the
governor for reorganization or other
changes. William Ashe, former La
Follette appointed director of the now
extinct department of commerce, was
originally offered the directorship of
the division, but he declined.
Milk Price C ontrol
Reenactment of the present fluid
milk control law for another two years
successfully completed its first step
toward passage last week as the assembly
engrossed the bill introduced
by Assemblymen Herzoz, Bichler, and
Ludviffsen. The present milk control
law will expire December 31, 1939.
While the assembly discussed the
bill, the state supreme court handed
down a decision affirming the right of
the department of agriculture and
markets, under the old law, of preventing
farmers from distributing
milk a t lower prices than the established
price in a milk control area.
Two amendments to the bill, one by
Assemblyman Catlin and the other by
Assemblyman Nicol, both adopted,
will considerably change the present
law, if the control bill is reenacted.
Catlin’s amendment will allow farmers
to sell milk on their own farms
at their own prices; in other words,
milk sold at the farm is exempt from
price regulation by the department.
Assemblyman NicoPs amendment
would guarantee the farmer 50 per
cent of the retail price. The amendment
was adopted by a vote of 73 to
22.
Capitol Notes
Governor Heil signed into law bills
which: 1. Permit a maximum moisture
content of 43 per cent in brick cheese.
2. Change the date of the automobile
license deadline from February 1 to
April 1, starting in 1940. 3. Provide
a penalty for the resale of University
of Wisconsin football tickets at more
than face value, a practice known as
“scalping.”
United States Attorney General
Frank Murphy, speaking in Madison
at the memorial exercises of the late
Robert M. La Follette, Sr., said, “ I
think the La Follettes are the best
political stock in the nation.” and conveyed
the impression that President
Roosevelt approved the coming senatorial
candidacy of Bob La Follette.
The senate during the week killed
the administration’s highway reorganization
bill which would replace the 3-
man commission with a single director,
but advanced beyond the amendable
stage a bill which makes the same
change in the public service commissin,
and also engrossed another which
consolidates all pension, welfare, penal
and correctional institutions into one
department. The assembly engrossed

News From Mission Hill
Last Thursday morning Rev. and
Mrs. C. Nestande of Grace Lutheran
Church of Eau Claire, and daughter,
Mary. Miss Peterson. Miss Baker (sister
of our Miss Baker) and Mrs.
Mickelson. all of Eau Claire, w-ere visitors
on the Hill. They enjoyed the
dav visiting classes, especially those of
Miss Garlie and Miss Baker. Rev.
Nestande said that when we have Miss
Garlie and Miss Baker, we have the
best the Eau Claire schools have to
ofjTer; and we are entirely convincc»d
that Rev. Nestande spoke the truth.
The Eau Claire friends came laden
with cookies, cakes, and a bushel of
peanuts. After school, accompanied by
the Misses Garlic and Baker, they visited
the Indian Settlement, Children’s
and Old People’s Homes.
Last Friday we all—children and
staff— enjoyed some of Luella’s “superswellelegant”
short cake topped
with strawberries, a gift from Mrs.
Stevens.
Two of our matrons have left , us:
Miss Doris Berg Friday evening for
Minneapolis where she has been offered
a position at the Veterans’ Hospital:
Mrs. Wold for Chicago on Sunday.
Mrs. Olin Hagen has been assisting
Miss Mathison this week.
The Misses Muus, Lindelien, Berg,
and Garlie drove to Green Bay and
Appleton last Saturday and visited
points of interest. Miss Lindelien
acquired a small marble dog as a souvenir
of the trip. She now has 412
dogs from 40 states.
* Saturday afternoon Miss Mathison.
Miss Anderson, Rev. Sihler, Mr. Wold
and Mr. Hanson took the Indian children
out to Clarence Ix)ken’s grove.
The children and a few of the adults
enjoyed a swrim in the river. After
the swimming all enjoyed the picnic
supper. A freezer of home-made ice
cream and the Eau Claire peanuts
made the picnic a complete success.
Aeeording to Miss Baker the month
on the Hill is not complete this year
until one has had a ride in Evalina II.
Evalina II, according to used-cars, is
a Jaloney (a Jalopy sold with baloney)
nnd the property of Eugene Hanson.
Her predecessor, Evalina I. cracked
her block one cold night when Mr.
Hanson failed to drain her radiator.
She was sold for $3.00 and two pairs
f ' ix. Evalina II takes corners on
two wheels and stops in reverse. As a
group of the teachers were experiencing
(one cannot truthfully say enjoying)
a thriller in Evalina II, Mr. Hanson
laconically remarked as the car
approached a railroad crossing, “ I
hope there are no trains coming. Evalina
II has no brakes.” I guess that’s
pretty funnv. I wouldn’t know.
Rev. Sihler preached in the W'inchester
church at Larson, Wis., Rev.
A. Olson’s charge, Sunday. He took
the train down Sunday morning and
teturned by train Sunday evening.
Sunday morning Mr. and Mrs. Opsat
ta and Mr. and Mrs. Garlie and
daughter Carol of Milwaukee visited
Mi-s Helen Garlie. Mrs. Opsatta and
Mr. Garlie are Helen’s sister and
brother. In the afternoon they also
visited the other institutions in W ittenberg.
Sunday afternoon Mr. and
Mrs. C. Hanson and their two children
of Kau Claire were visitors on the
Hill. Mr. Eugene Hanson’s folks were
visitors for a few minutes Sunday evering.
Sunday evening the children gathered
in front of the school house for an
open air Song Service. They learned
the melody for “ Now I Lay Me Down
to Sleep.” This familiar prayer has
been recently set to music by Dr.
Sihler, Rev. Sihler’s father.
On Tuesday the Soldier children visited
their grandparents in northern
Wisconsin. On Wednesday they visited
their two little sisters who are in
a foster home near Shawano.
Monday afternoon Mrs. Sihler was
honored with a birthday party and
presented with gifts from the staff.
Monday evening the staff from the
M.sHftin, Mrs. Art Larson and the
Slotten family were guests in the

Foreign investment was welcomed
by the expanding America
of 100 years ago. Today, with
domestic money and industry idle,
both Canada and the U. S. have
enough trouble without inviting
more. But one almost imperceptible
result of Europe's dictator m a d ness
has been a knocking on America's
gates by gold, men and industry
from abroad: German Jews
have brought their worldly goods;
Czecho-Slovakia's industrious m anufacturers
have sought refuge for
the plants that once supplied lowpriced
import goods for the American
market. Results:
I ’ nited States. Hit by industrial
lethargy more severely than agricultural
Canada, the U. S. has offered
no refuge to foreign factories,
largely because domestic manufacturers
are sufficiently vocal to protest
successfully. But money influx
is something else. Secretary of
JA N BATA
Workers are not invited.
Commerce H arry Hopkins recently
found foreign investments here rose
from *7.036.000,000 at the end of 1937
to $7,883,000,000 at the end of 1938.
Though much increase came from
rising common stock prices last
year, $49,000,000 represented net
purchases of U. S. securities.
Canada. Several million pairs of
Czech-made Bata shoes have been
sold annually in the U. S. and Canada.

largest industry of its kind in the
world, escaped with his money and

invaded Czecho-Slovakia. Popping
up in Canada, he proposed to
re-establish his plant at Prescott,
Ont., supplying British dominions,
the U. S. and Canadian markets
from a factory manned by skilled
Czech workers. Confidently expected
is a compromise, but Czech
workmen will not be imported. Other
signs-of-the-times:
C One thousand farm families from
Sudetenland are being settled in
western Canada, the first 250 families
having already arrived. Regarding
Jewish refugees, Canada's
immigration department makes no
issue of race or religion, but demands
that applicants either possess
skill and money, or relations
in Canada to support them.
C Foreign currency deposits in
Canadian banks rose from $47,000,-

$71,000,000 this year. In addition,
refugee money is pouring into Canadian
mining and industrial stocks.
Significance. Most observers
agree that a huge transfer of wealth
from Europe to America helps no
one and hurts both continents, Europe
because it reduces that industria
l continent's already meager industrial
resources; America, because
it gluts still more an already
money-and-industry glutted hemisphere.
ASIA:
Crossroads
No mystery to white men in the
Orient is Ja p a n ’s purpose in getting
obstreperous over foreign concessions
in Tientsin and other Chinese
cities. With the rest of coastal
China conquered, Japan finds European
settlements its principal obstacle
to consummation of the “ new
order” program. Thus observers
expect continually expanding pressure
unless Britain protects its
rights in the Tientsin concession
which Ja pa n blockaded recently.
Should Britain capitulate, as she has
done repeatedly the past few years,
Shanghai, Hankow, Amoy, and Canton
concessions will be wiped out
immediately to end a fascinating
chapter in modern Chinese history:
Concessions and settlements date
back almost 100 years, constituting
a special position for occidental
powers which thereby gain importance
far out of proportion to the
individual settlement’s size. Ex am ple:
Though all foreign areas in
China total about 17 square miles
and house only 50,000 white men,
Ja p a n has been forced to divert her
attack around them.
The white m a n ’s star began descending
in the East 40 years ago
when Japan ousted British concessions
from her own insular territory.
At Tientsin, eight settlements
that began in 1860 have dwindled
to three (British, Italian and J a p anese).
Only in Canton have E u ropean
settlements missed trouble.
Minus concessions, the U. S. nevertheless
helps rule Shanghai and
Amoy, also protecting American
residents who live in other large
Chinese cities. American garrisons,
stationed to help maintain order at
Shanghai, Tientsin, and Peking, may
yet be called upon to take their
choice: Resist or bow out of China
with other white men.

TAXATION:
Profit Sharing
Last autumn a special senate
committee inspired by Michigan's
presidency-aspiring Sen. Arthur
Vandenberg began studying profit
sharing as a means of curing capital-
labor trouble. The basic idea:
Industrialists would get tax credits
for sharing their profits or ( if regarded
in another light) would be
penalized if they did not share profits).
Though pointedly socialistic,
the idea caught fire when one witness
after another told how profit
sharing had worked successfully.
Soon Republican Vandenberg's idea
began looking good to his Democratic
colleagues. Iowa's Sen. Clyde
Herring and Colorado's Edwin C.
Johnson, both of whom knew the
administration needed a clever card
trick to soothe tax-irritated business.
By mid-June Mr. Vandenberg had
lost the ball entirely, for Senators
Herring and Johnson issued the
committee's cautiously worded report.
Its gist was that some ‘‘prudent
experiments” in incentive taxation
could be tried “ in the spirit
of exploration.” Points (with critics'
concensus in ita lic s ):
1. Exemption from all income
taxes of the payments industrialists
make to employees from accumulated
profit-sharing retirement funds
or annuities. IGood idea. Although il
uoutd temporarily make tocial security a
duplication, that agency uould eventually
grow smaller oj prmiuon for old age returned
to private handt.J
2. Issuance and sale of government
profit-sharing bonds which
would be available only to profitsharing
funds and would be issued
for the purpose of protecting investments
by employees. (Good and bad.
Uould discourage small private investment
and small hanking, meanuhile providing
neir source of money jor government
spending. May he discriminatory. But
uould also loosen large private capital for
priiate iniestment.)
3. Specific tax credits for increased
employment by companies following
other than capitalexpenditure
work; similarly, reasonable exemption
on such expenditures as plant
expansion. tGtmd and had. ICould
louer business taxes, but places capital in
the position of a child uho u-ill be praised
by a paternalistic got ernment if he does
right and punished if he does wrong. Presupposes
that profit sharing, thus far untried
on a national basis, would be sub.
stantially a cure-all that would permit
drastic reduction in *extraordinary** government
expendituresJ
Essentially a successful idea in
private application, profit sharing
will probably be boosted by both
Democrats and Republicans in the
next campaign. Chief issue (and no
one yet knows which party will take
which side) will be on the application
of government incentive taxation.
Said the report:
"O ne school of thought insists that
the taxing power should never ba
used for either incentive or punitive
purposes, and that one is the
complement of the other. The other
school of thought insists that we already
have the punitive tax and that
—confronting a condition rather
than a theory—we should also have
the incentive tax, either as an offset
or * substitute.”
W A S H IN G T O N - A bit of testimony
before the temporary national
economic comm ttee, put together
with President Roosevelt's enthusiastic
endorsement of the bill of Senator
Jam e s M. Mead of New York
for loans to small business, and then
added to the frequently stated doctrine
of the President that one of
the causes of thc bust of 1929 was
a tremendous increase in overcapacity
by our producers, unaccompanied
by increased spending
power to take up the slack, presents
a curious picture
It almost justities the pessimism
of C hairm an Marriner S. Eccles,
of the federal reserve board, as to
the good that the Mead bill would
do if enacted.
The curious part of the whole
thing is that Mr. Roosevelt, it would
seem, would encourage the same
sort of increase n over-capacity by
means of the Mead bill that he began
deploring in his 1932 acceptance
speech. He spoke then of the
vast profits of the corporations in
the good years, and wanted to know
what had become of them. “ Some
of them ,” he declared, “ have gone
into increases of plant, now standing
stark and idle.”
His theory then, as enunciated
m any times since, was that if this
money, instead of being put into unneeded
additions to plant capacity,
had been paid out in wages, or
even dividends, the discrepancy
between buying power and producing
power would not have zoomed
to the point where it produced the
1929 crash and the depression.
Reference to this testimony leads
to speculation as to whether government
aid to the little fellows may
not work the same havoc that greed
on the part of the big fellows produced
in 1929.
Points Out Inherent
Dangers in Mead B ill
On the stand was T. N. B. Hicks
J r . urging, on behalf of the Wyoming
valley industrial development
fund, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., more
liberal credit. He said there was a
sm all silk throwing company which
would buy additional machines if it
could borrow cheaply.
“ Are you satisfied,” inquired Senator
Joe O'Mahoney of W yoming (no
connection with the Wyoming valley
in question), "th at there is a market
for the product of this company if
it were enabled to acquire the m a chinery.”
“ The company already has the
business, Senator,” replied Mr.
Hicks. “ They are already farm ing
it out under contract."
“ And not doing it themselves,”
said Mr. Hicks. "They want to do
| it in our com m unity ."
"W e ll, if the business is being performed
on contract,” continued
O'Mahoney, “ this financing would
merely mean shifting the production
' from one plant to another p lan t."
"Y e s ,” said Mr. Hicks, “ for all
practical purposes. It means, on
| the other hand, in our particular
community, three hundred jobs.
Senator.”
! “ B u t,” retorted O ’Mahoney, “ three
hundred jobs in your community
taken away from some other com m
u n ity ."
This is not cited by the writer
to demonstrate that the Mead bill
is bad, or would work harm . But it
is cited to show that there are cerj
tain dangers in the Mead bill, just
I as there are inherent dangers in
any government control of credit,
or anything else, for that matter,
which arbitrarily changes the lives
• and habits of people.
I Sometimes There Are
Four Sitles tn a Question
Sometimes there are four sides to
; a question, instead of only two. The
authorization measure for the Ten-
! nessee Valley authority to issue
$100,000,000 in bonds to finance the
purchase of the private utility properties
in Tennessee seems to be such
a case.
Introduced by Senator George W.
Norris, it passed the senate with
little or no discussion,
but since then
for a time has been
stymied in the house
appropriations committee.
Actually it
was held up by the
coal operators. They
pointed out to committee
members
that this was nearly
twice as much money
as TVA needed
for paying the Commonwealth
and Southern and the
Electric Bond and Share for the
properties of their subsidiaries.
“ What,” they demanded, "does
TVA need with the forty odd m illions
in excess of that amount?
The inference taken by the coal
Senator Norris
people of course was that TVA
would build additional hydro electric
plants. That is where the coal
interests come in, for obviously every
time a hydro plant is built just
that much of coal market departs
forever, no matter how the resulting
electricity is used.
Behind the scenes the private utility
folks have been in a quandary.
N aturally they have the same interest
as the coal people in preventing,
if possible, further invasion of
the electric field by the government.
They are especially close to the
coal people in their interests since
most of the private utility executives
now figure that current can be
produced more cheaply from coal,
by using modern methods than it
can be produced by water power, if
due allowance is made in computing
its cost for interest on the cost
of the hydro electric plant, and for
taxes.
Which brings in another angle; for
the state, county and m unicipal governments
in Tennessee were anxious
to force a provision into the bill
which would require the TVA and
the local agencies set-up for public
distribution of electricity to pay
into the state and local treasuries
the same amount of money each
year which they would have paid
had they continued.
Don't Like to Have Public
Power Systems Handicapped
This is a sore point with the public
ownership advocates. They do
not like to have the public power
systems handicapped with this
charge of taxes. Naturally the private
utility people are keen for it,
contending that go "y ard s tick " approaches
fairness unless this is included.
In fact taxes and a comparable
amount of interest are the
two chief advantages which public
electric systems have had over privately
owned systems in fixing low
rates.
David E. Lilienthal pointed out in
the TVA special committee hearings
at Knoxville last summer that the
government could borrow money for
2 per cent while private enterprise
would have to pay much more. But
private utility men have been contending
ever since this is only part
of the story—that in fixing rates the
TVA has made no charge whatever
for the millions of dollars interest
every year the taxpayers have to
pay for the cost of the TVA project.
Also that in local public ownership
systems 45 per cent of the cost
would be a free grant from PWA,
with the other 55 per cent at a low
rate of interest.
But the utility people would like
to see government money actually
paid for the Tennessee properties,
and the stupid possibility of competition
between private and public
ownership systems prevented. So
they would like to see the bill
passed, with certain amendments.
The coal people don’t care much
about the amendments, but want
them written in if the bill is to pass.
Reception of British Rulers
In Canada lolts Dictators
Whether British P rim e Minister
Chamberlain "planned it that way”
may never be known, but the visit
of the king and queen to Canada
m ay easily have stayed the hands
of Mussolini and Hitler for some
tim e to come.
The reports of the tremendous
ovation which their majesties received
from Quebec to Vancouver
and back must have surprised and
startled the foreign offices of Berlin
and Rome as much as they did
the Canadian politicians. There is
no speculation about this. Em inent
political leaders of all parties in
Canada frankly said so to visiting
Am erican newspaper men.
In short, the greeting of the
Canadians, no matter what was the
mother country to their own fathers
and mothers, put an entirely different
face on the probabilities as to
what Canada would do if Great B ritain
should become involved in a
war.
It is a truism in politics, certainly
in the United States and probably
in Canada, that it is not the truth
which is important, but what people
believe. Carrying on the thought
a bit further, it is not what the people
believe which is really important—
in between elections—but what
the politicians they have elccted to
represent them think the people
believe.
It is as simple as that.
Menial Attitude of Crouds
Big Surprise of Visit
British and American newspaper
men on the “ pilot" train which ran
always— until it neared Washington
and developed trouble—a little
ahead of the royal train, were
amazed at thc outpourings. They
would be told, not only by the
Canadian officials, but by their Canadian
newspaper colleagues, that this
particular town would not be worth
while—that it had been kept on the
schedule through a mistake, and
that only a few hundred people
could possibly be there.
Then they would arrive and the
whole surrounding countryside
would have apparently turned out,
for there would be thousands.
Even more important, it was the
m ental attitude of the crowds which
had been appraised even more inaccurately
in advance. Their m a jesties
had been warned not to expect
too much. The people in one
community, they were told, would
be mostly Scotch, and hence dour
and cold, though pleasant, while in
another community most of the people
would be Poles. Germans, Russians,
etc., who could not be expected
to be too enthusiastic.

CH A PT E R V I—Continued
Glovere explained then, watching
these newcomers: **I don't know
anything about—last night. Miss
Leaford had just told me that her
mother was de ad ." His eyes flickered
from one of them to the other;
and when no one spoke, he said in
a sort of swift passion: "Som e one
tell me what has happened. Why
did you come here?”
“ They said Miss Leaford m ight
be here,” Clint answered. " I was
driving past, last night, overtook
her on the road. She was running,
through all that rain. I gave her a
lift as fa r as Doctor Cabler’*
house.”
June was afraid he would say
more than this; she hurried to explain;
"Y o u see, Uncle J im , Mother hated
thunder and lightning. So when
the storm came near, I went in to
see if she was all right. And when
I saw her, I knew she was—dead.
B ut I lost my head, I guess. Calling
the Doctor was the only thing I
could think o f."
"W h at happened?” Uncle J im insisted.
“ She took too many sleeping-tablets,”
June told h im , in a low tone.
‘‘You know, she was sick from doing
that, once before.” Her face suddenly
was stony calm . ‘‘I gave
them to her,” she whispered. " I
gave them to her, and she died.”
Clint caught her hand. "N ow listen,”
he protested. “ You—”
Her head leaned back against the
cabin wall. "She insisted on taking
two,” the girl said. “ I couldn’t persuade
her not to. I was afra id .”
She whispered: "O h , I wish I ’d
spilled them a ll!” And then she explained
:
“ You see, she couldn’t get to
sleep, so she got up and went to
the bathroom and took the rest of
them .”
Tope asked thoughtfully: “ You
spilled some of them, you l a y ? ”
“ While I was getting one for her,”
Ju n e answered. “ I set the bottle
down on the basin, and it fell and
tipped over. They spilled out, and
there was water in the basin, a little.
The tablets in the water dissolved.
There weren’t but three left
in the bottle. And I took one of
them to her, one besides the one I
already had. Then she must have
heard the thunder coming, and she
was afraid of lightning. So she got
up and took the other two. Oh, I
wish I ’d spilled them all.”
"H ow do you know all this?” Uncle
J im asked. There was a rasp
in his tones; something challenging
and angry. “ How does anyone know
what she d id ? ”
“ Why, the other tablets were
gone," said June.
“ Bottle em pty?” Uncle J im Insisted.
The girl hesitated. “ I don't
know,” she said. “ We d idn't And
the bottle. It's probably under the
bed, or in the bed or something.
W* d idn’t look there. She was
there.” H er tone wavered.
C lint held her hand hard.
He said; "N ow you forget It,
Miss Leafordl Don't worry. There's
nothing to be afraid of.”
•*I wasn’t afraid—o f y o u ," ahe
confessed, and saw the leap of
pleasure in his eyes, and was happy
that she had pleased him . But suddenly
she was uneasy; she had
stayed too long. “ I must go back,”
she said.
C lint rose. " I ’ll go with you.”
"W ill you?” she asked gratefully.
They went past the others. “ Miss
Leaford is going home,” C lint explained.
" I ’ll come back here.”
They came within sight of the
houses; and Clint paused.
" I won’t go in,” he said. " R e m
em ber, though, I'm coming again.
Soon.”
He caught her hand and held it.
Incredibly, he kissed her hand, the
backs of her fingers. She saw his
eyes shine.
“ Good-by,” he said.
She loosed her hand and went on
alone, and she held one hand over
the other, to protect and treasure
the spot his lips had touched.
She went on toward the house.
When sh* had gone in, Asa cam *
• tt a r her, quietly, out of th* wood.
C H A PT E R V II
I t was to be Miss Moss who perceived
beyond dispute that Kitty
Leaford had been murdered. She
had stayed behind, in the car, when
the garage m an Thayer, in response
to Tope's inquiry went to point out
the path that led to J im Glovere’s
cabin. Thayer returned, and a girl
came out of the office of the garage
to join him . Thayer called her Lissa;
she was, Miss Moss perceived,
his daughter; and Miss Moss had
some casual talk with them.
After a time she saw Lissa's eyes
suddenly fix on something toward
the house, in an expression of concern;
and Miss Moss looked that
way to see a m an moving secretly
among the trees. Then Lissa without
a word went toward the house
and disappeared indoors. She did
“ Not m uch chance,” h* said.
not reappear, but neither did the
secret m an. Miss Moss thought she
would know his form again. She
fell to talking with Thayer, and
when by and by the Inspector and
C lint returned, she thought her time
here had not been misspent.
Clint said eagerly: "I'v e seen her.
Talked with her. She’s a w o nder!"
Miss Moss said: " I s she, Clint?
That’s flne.” But she looked expectantly
at the older man.
Inspector Tope without a word got
into the car, and Clint took the
wheel. They started back toward
Boston.
"A ccident?” Miss Moss asked
presently.
Tope answered in an abstracted
tone: “ Doctor Derrie says sol He
w ill call it accident, yes.” He
sighed, as though he were tired.
“ The trouble with m e,” he confessed,
“ I ’m a meddling tool.”
"W h a t is it?” she asked. “ What
disturbs you?”
He wagged hia head doubtfully. “ I
don’t know,” he admitted. “ Here’s
a woman dead, and as far as you can
see, there's no mystery about it.
But there are a lot of little things,
strange, unusual—”
Miss Moss asked: “ What are
they? That Miss Leaford should run
for a doctor, without stopping to
dress, for instance?”
The old m an m ade a gesture as
though to brush away an annoying
swarm of mosquitoes. “ Why, that,
yes,” he agreed. "Then the telephone
was out of order, and the electric
light went out at the wrong
time, and the front door of the house
blew open in spite of the fact it was
always bolted at night. And then
this m an that lives up here in the
woods— ”
Miss Moss broke in with a question:
“ What is he like? What did you
think of h im ? ”
“ He’s a strong m an ,” answered
Tope, "doing nothing. Lives up
there alone, writes poetry for fun,
tram ps around the woods, and looks
at Miss Leaford as though she
meant a lot to him. He told me
that now that her mother is dead, he
had a mind to take June away from
here.”
Clint cried angrily; "H e did? That
—tram p ! I 'll—"
Miss Moss asked acutely; " I f h*'s
to fond of M ist Leaford, what do«a
he think of the rest of the Kenesaw
connection?"
Tope chuckled. "H e talked quite
a lot about th em ," he admitted.
“He seemed to know them pretty
well, know a lot about them. He
says old Mrs. Bowdon and her
daughter, Mrs. Taine, have things
their own way up there. He said
they were like people living in the
valley below a big d am . Bowdon is
a wealthy m an, and Hurder too;
and their money is like the water
behind the d am , waiting to flow
down the valley when they die, flow
into new channels. The others all
sit there waiting for the d am to
break, with their buckets ready to
catch the overflow, afraid they'll let
a few drops get aw ay.”
Miss Moss said softly: ‘‘That's
why they’re a fra id !”
Tope looked at her in quick attention.
" E h ? ” he exclaimed. "W hy
should they be afraid? After all,
the money can't get out of the fam ily.”
"H av ing things makes people
afraid ,” she reminded h im . "A man
with nothing to lose has nothing to
fear.”
Tope shook his head. ‘‘I don’t
know,” he demurred. “ I t ’s mighty
easy to be afraid . . . There's one
other thing—probably no connection.
But when Clint and I were on our
way in to Glovere's cabin, we saw
a m an in the woods. He was coming
down the path toward us; but he
spotted us, about as soon as we
saw h im , a hundred yards away or
so. And he ducked to one side, out
of the way, and kept out of sight
while we went b y."
“ Why d id n’t you speak to h im ? ”
"CUnt here was in a hurry to go
o n," the Inspector chuckled.
“ I d id n’t even see this m a n ,”
Clint explained. " I think the In spector
imagined him . He's seeing
things today, anyway.”
Miss Moss sat thoughtful for a
while; but she said at last, smiling:
"H e didn't imagine this. I saw your
m an come out of the woods. The
garage proprietor has a daughter.
He calls her Lissa. I think that was
her young m an. She j a s with me
when he came in sight, but she left
me then, and neither of them reappeared.”
Tope chuckled. “ Trust you to dig
up any romance that's lying
a ro u n d !" he exclaimed. "D o n ’t
know who it was, do you?”
“ No, but I know Lissa Thayer
was troubled by his com ing ," Miss
Moss declared. “ That was plain, in
her eyes.” And she asked: “ This
Mr. Glovere—how old did you think
he was?”
The Inspector watched her. "F o r ty-
five and u p,” he said. “ Maybe
ten years more.”
"O ld enough to be Miss Leaford's
father,” Miss Moss reflected. And
she added, still smiling: “ You see,
I begin to wonder about things too,
Inspector. I've caught the habit
from yo u ." She ceased to smile.
“ I ’m wondering now,” she said
gravely, "how many of these tablets
it would take, to kill a person
so quickly.”
The Inspector looked at Miss Moss
with a sort of wonder. He said at
last:
"M rs. Tope, you m ake me feel
like a m an on crutches. You can
jum p farther, and straighter, than
anyone I ever saw.”
“ I was just wondering,” she protested,
her cheek bright with pleasure
in his praise.
“ I think you've hit it ," he said.
"D e rrie missed it, and Heale, and
so did I. But I think you’ve hit it
on the nose, We'll see.” He looked
ahead. “ Clint, pull in at the first
drug-store,” he said. “ I want to telephone.”
When he came out to them again,
Clint asked quickly: "D id you call
Doctor Derrie?”
" I called Doc Gero,” Tope explained.
This was the Medical E x aminer
with whom the old m an had
worked for so many years. "D o c tor
Gero thinks that it would need
eight or ten tablets, maybe more,
to have killed Mrs. Leaford so soon.
He said if one was a dose, and three
made her pretty sick, four or five
might put her into a coma so that
she would die in twenty-four hours
or so. Specially if she had a weak
heart.
“ But to be dead in three hours,
that would need eight or ten tablets,
and m aybe more.”
His tone had the finality of doom.
“ And there weren't that many tablets
left in the bottle!” he concluded.
Miss Moss said in a low tone:
“ I was afraid so. Then it was m u rder.
What will you do?”
Tope shook his head. "W h y ,” he
said, " I guess we'll have to go
back.” He chuckled in a dry mirth.
“ It looks like I ’d have to annoy
young Doc Derrie again.”
When they came back to headquarters,
Heale was there.
“ Now what ia it. Tope?” he asked
patiently.
Tope hesitated; he said then:
"H e re ’s the sticker, Heale. Miss
Leaford gave her mother two tablets.
There were two more left, in
the bottle in the bathroom cabinet.
And Doctor Derrie figures the dead
woman got up and took thos*
two. That's right, isn’t it? ”
Heale nodded. “ Yes,” he said.
“Now then,” Tope explained, “ two
and two m ake four If Doctor Derrie's
right, she took four tablets.
And two or three hours later she
was dead.”
“ Sure,” Heale repeated.
Tope leaned back in his chair.
“ Then here's the rest of it,” he
said. “ You know Doctor Gero, the
Medical E xaminer in town?”
"O f course.”
“ Well, Doctor Gero says it would
take at least six, and more likely
eight or ten tablets to kill this woman
dead in three hours.”
Inspector Heale looked at Tope,
frowning a little, for a long time. He
started to shake his head; then
abruptly he lifted the telephone beside
him .
"G e t m e Doctor Cabler,” he d irected;
and presently: “ Doctor Cabler?
Inspector Heale speaking. I'd
Uke to consult you on this Leaford
case. Can you come down? . . .
Thanks.” He returned the receiver
to its hook again. “ Doctor Cabler
wiU know,” he told them.
Tope nodded. “The bottle's missing,”
he reminded Inspector Heale.
“ That m ay have significance or not.
Have you been in the house
searched the bedroom?”
Heale shook his head. “ No excuse
to do that,” he protested. “ So
far as we knew officially, it was
an accident. I don't want to antagonize
those people unnecessarUy,
Tope. You can see that.”
" I ’d like to look around in there,”
Tope confessed. “ Unofficially. Without
their knowing.”
Inspector Heale grinned. “ Not
m uch chance,” he said.
Miss Moss spoke for the first time.
“ When is the fu ne ra l?" she inquired.
“ It m ight be managed then,” In spector
Heale agreed. " I f they aU
go. Of course, they'll lock the house.
They have no servants. We'll have
to get someone to arrange it so
we can get in ."
“ Miss Leaford will do that,” Clin*
proposed.
“ I ’d rather try Asa T aine," In spector
Heale decided. "H e might
be reasonable. 1 know h im better
than I know any of the others." He
lifted the telephone. “ I ’ll send one
of the boys to ask h im to com*
down,” he said.

Washington Loved to Ride After Foxes
A nd Attend Cockfights, Diary Reveals
John Peel ia the hero of th* E ng lish
hunting song, but to American
fox hunters George Washington is
almost a patron saint. This fact
is brought to light by Samuel J
Henry in "Foxhunting Is Different,”
a volume on the sport in V irginia
and Maryland, in which Washington’s
diaries are used as background
for many sketches.
"George Washington, many-sided
man, attended a cockfight and a
vestry meeting on the same d ay ,”
writes the author. “ He would go to
church and enter in his diary the
pious duty as performed. But he
said not who the preacher was
nor subject of the sermon. Foxes,
hounds and hunting were matters
that loomed large in his philosophy,
and there is detaU after detail.
"Y o u cannot help loving Washington
when you read his diaries, an
unstudied record of day-to-day happenings.
The m an stands forth alive
. . . Despite the treatment he has
received at the hands of historians,
who have made h im an aloof and
detached god to a fellow-lover of
sport the V irginian seems a departed
friend, a human and responsive
character with whom h* haa spent

m an y happy hours afield; for foxhunters
. . . speak the same language.
“ In the carefree years of 1788-69-
70, the V irginian planted and reaped,
bred horses, experimented with the
soil, ingeniously sought to devise a
better plow . . With meticulous
detail he tells about each hunt, how
long it lasted, whether the quarry
was lost, denned or killed, of hounds
switching from fox to deer, and says
they once got after a bear.”
Washington's huntsman was a little
Negro named Billy Lee, a former
jockey, who, according to this authority,
after his master died,
"d ra n k himself to death, dying of
the D. T.’s ."
Snow and Blue Gees*
Unlike Canada geese, the snows
seldom fly in V-formation. Adult
snow geese have pur* white bodies
with black wingtipa, with pink or
pale purplish bill*. Blue geese,
■bout the same size as snows, have
white heads and necks, grayishbrown
bodies (not blue as the nam*
indicates), dark red bill* and purplish-
red legs. Th* young ar* sootygray
or brown.
When the mercury soars skyward
and appetites are on the wane, nothing
tastes quite so good as a crisp,
cool mixture of fresh greens, or
fruits, or vegetables with a tart,
taste-teasing dressing.
Salads are summer favorites.
There’s hardly a dish that's so simple
yet so satisfying to make, and
there's such a pleasant way of m aking
sure that we get the minerals
and vitamins we need!
Suggestions on Salads.
Salad ingredients must be clean
and cold and crisp. Contrast is im portant,
too—contrast
in textures,
in flavors, and in
colors. Combine
crisp foods with
soft; sharp, pungent-
tasting foods
with m ild - flavored
ones; and
pale, uninteresting looking foods
with foods that are vividly colored.
Make your summer salads as light
or as substantial as you please.
Find a few good basic recipes, and
vary them to suit yourself. Her*
are some of my own favorites—
practical, everyday recipes that are
easy to prepare and serve, yet delicious
enough for almost any social
occasion. ,

Hank Nite— Lottery
“ Bank Nights” do constitute a lottery
and can be stopped by public
officials or any private citizen who
brings an action to abate a nuisance
says the state supreme court.
The court, however, refused to issue
a temporary injunction against
La Crosse theaters because it decided
this action should be left to the dis
cretion of the trial courts.
Usual form of bank night is for
patrons to register at the theaters,
then receive a specified sum of money
or some other prize when numbers are
drawn during the performance.
The state’s highest court decided
that the three elements which consti
tute a lottery—chance, prize and i
consideration or payment — were all
present. Theater attorneys admitted
that the elements of chance and prize
were present, but denied the presence
of the third element because they eontended
that persons could register and
had a chance at the prizes though
they did not buy tickets. Said the
court, however, " . . . a lottery is no
less a lottery because the management
gives away numbers to some persons.
It is only all the more objectionable
because it does not limit the drawees
to the persons buying tickets and
thus lessens the chance of those who
pay for their tickets.”
Theater attorneys had also contended
that even if the bank night
was a lottery, the only action that
could be taken was a criminal action,
and not an injunctive action to abate
a nuisance. But the court declared
that even though the statutes did not
mention lotteries as nuisances, they
could be declared such by the courts.

Pilots Defeat Birnamwood
The Pilots journeyed to Birnamood
Sunday and took a rejuvenated B lineup
into camp to the tune of 10 to 5.
There was nothing spectacular
about the game, the Pilots took an
early lead and held it throughout the
game.
Henry Wolff and John Arnold broke
into the lineup and showed the fans
what it takes. Henry came through
with two hits and John turned in some
wonderful defensive work at second.
Next Sunday Wittenberg will play
at Eland. This game should be a
pitcher’s battle between Krull and
Strong, the two leading pitchers of
the league.
Last Sunday’s score:
THE FOURTH O F JU L Y
Another Fourth is almost here—
the 163rd since that memorable July
4, 1776, when the Declaration of
Independence was adopted. Strange
as it may seem, the Fourth of Ju ly is
not a National legal holiday, for no
legislation declaring it to be such has
ever been enacted by Congress. However,
the day is celebrated throughout
the Union; and in all states but Kansas,
Kentucky, Mississippi, and South
Carolina it has been designated a legal
holiday by statute. In these four
states it is observed by consent
When we were young, Independence
Day was a community celebration. In
the morning there were divine services
in which the whole community participated.
The service was followed by
a “SW E L L” picnic dinner! In the a fternoon
there was a program with
drills, recitations, and songs by the
children, and a fine speech by some
able orator. The program was follow
ed by athletic games and contests for
men, women, and children from the
toddlers up and there were prizes.
(We were practising three-legged
races, sack races, wheel-barrow races,
et cetera for weeks before the 4th.)
After a simple supper which we took
at home, we congregated at the tennis
courts or sought some high point from
where we could get full benefit of the
fire works which the committee-onarrangements
had provided.
The expense entailed for ice cream,
lemonade for the picnic lunch, for
prizes for the race, and the fire works
in the evening was met by subscription.
Every family in the community
was solicited and gave a dollar or more
which we all considered cheap for the
fun we had, the prizes we carried
home, the lemonade and ice cream we
consumed, and the fire works we enjoyed.
Individually we were satisfied
not to buy any fire crackers with
which to frazzle the nerves of the oldsters.
Those old Fourths were some
of the happiest days of our childhood.
We went to bed »*ach Fourth of July
tremendously proud to be Americans
intensely loyal to our country and
determined in our hearts to he a credit
to such a wonderful land.
Children of today will also have
their memories of the Fourth: a long
trip in a car to visit folks, a picnic by
a lake or a family reunion. With their
Fourth they will perhaps associate
program in the park and a base ball
game, ice cream cones, pop, and fire
works.
Whatever our memories and however
we celebrate the day I hope not one of
us forgets that on the Fourth of July
1776, this country became an independent
nation. Let us try to rear our
children to be American citizens who
will share our pride in this the great
est and most richly blessed of all tia
tions.

Strelow Writes From Annapolis
United States Naval Academy,
Annapolis, Maryland, June 23, 1939.
My dear Mr. Englund:
I have been successful in my physical
examination for entrance into the
Naval Academy.
I had a wonderful trip from Wisconsin
to the eastern coast and I must
say that Wisconsin is far more beautiful
than any of the other states I have
seen. However, to a boy from the
middle west the mountainous region is
very spectacular.
The beauty and the facilities of the
Academy amazes me more than anything
I have ever seen. One of the
largest dormitories in the world, one
of the largest indoor swimming pools,
a million dollar museum which has
miniature models of many of the
famous ships and many more interesting
things are located on the grounds
of the Academy. They have seaplanes,
submarines, and every other
type of water craft for the training of
the midshipmen. They have everything
to make a young man want to
go to the Academy.
The young fellows who come here
are from every walk of life. Most of
them are sincere in their desire to be
officers of the navy. They are obedient
and ambitious; they are determined
to live up to the rigid regulations of
the Navy.
The Academy takes care of the
needs of the midshipmen. They receive
good shoes, clothing and food.
Medical and dental service is also fu rnished.
I t is a complete little town in
itself.
Sincerely, Reuben Strelow.

D IF F E R E N T METHODS
Hotel Clerk—In the old days this
cove was famous.
Guest—Your methods m ay be a
little different but keep ’em up an .
you'll soon be just as famous.
Throw the Book Away
Two old settlers, confirmed bachelors,
sat in the backwoods. The
conversation drifted from politics
and finally got around to cooking.
“ I got one o' them cookery books
once, but I never could do nothing
with it.”
"Too much fency work in it, e h ? "
" Y o u ’ve said it I Every one o’
them recipes began the same way:
‘Take a clean dish—' and that settled
m e .”
NO T IIK ILLS
Moth—Confound these new fangled
candles anyway. There’s no chance
of getting sinned at all!
CAN DID
The Inspector was paying his
monthly visit to the village school.
He examined the children in reading
and general knowledge, and
was very pleased with the answers
he received.
After the last question had been
asked and answered satisfactorily
he rose to his feet and, looking at
the upturned faces, remarked genially:
“ I wish 1 were a little boy at
school again I”
He allowed a few minutes for this
to sink in and then added: “ Do you
know why I wish that?”
For a m om e nt or two there was
silence. Then came a childish voice
from the back of the room: "Cos
you’ve forgot all you ever knowed.”
Ah, That's It
A housewife found a pleasant arom
atic odor pervading her home one
morning recently and, on investigation,
discovered that it emanated
from the kitchen, where a m aid had
treated the linoleum on the kitchen
floor with wax.
Complimenting the girl on her industry,
the housewife nevertheless
wondered the reason for it all.
“ O h,” said the m aid blandly, “ I
always likes my kitchen floor
waxed. It absolves the spots and
then it smells so sanitoriously.”
WHAT P R IC E BEAU TY ?
M a ria n—A g irl can’t be too careful
of her skin; I hold m y complexion
very dear.
Maud—Isn’t it, though? Mine costt
me every cent I can get.
Alex Was Lost
Teacher was telling the class
about the conquest of Alexander the
Great.
"When Alexander had conquered
In d ia ," she said, "w h at do you think
he did? Do you think he gave a
great feast to celebrate his triumph?
No, he sat down and wept.”
"N ow why do you think Alexander
w ept?" she asked.
Up shot a hand.
"Please, miss,” said Freddie,
"perhaps he didn't know the way
b ac k."
Anxious
"A re you anxious to have school
begin a g a in ?” asked little Jane's
aunt, who was visiting the fam ily
on vacation.
“ Oh, yes” responded the child.
“ I think it would be swell if school
would begin tomorrow and then end
the next day, and vacation could
start all over again.”
Competition
Employer—You can have the position
m y lad, but you would nol
have got it if I had had any choice.
Fancy coming after a situation with
a dirty collar, a torn coat, and a
black eye.
Boy—That’s nothing; you should
have seen the other three chapi
who were after the job.
Vivid Description
F a t Man—Well, what do you think
of m y boy?
Friend—Well, I'd say he is e stave
oS the old barrel.
S B E SHOULD KNOW
Mr. Mugg—This lawn party ia
horribly dull. I guess I'll go home.
Miss Nice—That would remove
some of the dullness, I ’m sure.
Agreed
Her Father—Young m an, I dem
and an explanation. What was the
idea of your kissing m y daughter
in that dark hallway?
Young Man—Now that I ’ve seen
her by daylight I wonder myself.
Distinctive Architecture
New Uncle (by m a rria g e )—Well,
Tommy, I've met all your brothers
except the oldest, George. Whst side
of the nouse does he look like?

AMERICANS

^ I N C E the dawn of mmlern history men have sought vengeance and
nature has been violent in July. Ilo t. sultry, Ju ly has tried men's
souls and found them wanting. Above: White flag of truce floats over
a hut in the “Holy City” of Adowa during the Ethiopian war which
Mussolini began in July of 1935. R igh t: One month after Austrian
Archduke Ferdinand was
assassinated at Sarajevo, M B
Germany was in the midst - >53*%
of its attack against Belgium
and France. The exact
date was July 28, 1914,
which was 125 years to the
month after the “ Bastille
Day” coup that started the
French revolution. This
Ju ly France is celebrating
the 150th anniversary of
Bastille incident.

Francisco Franco came out
of exile to begin the civil
war which tore that country
asunder for more than
two years. Photo shows
the general dispatching a
message to one of his d ivisions
as he directed the
advance to Barcelona.
One year later, on Ju ly 7, 1937, occurred the notorious Marco Polo
bridge incident marking the official beginning of Japan's war against
China, now two years old and still undeclared. Photo above shows
rescue workers removing victims after one of the horrible bombings
to which civilians have been subjected. Left: The funeral of Austria's
martyred chancellor, E ngelbert
Dollfuss, who tins
assassinated on July 25,
1934, in an unsuccessful
Nazi coup to gain control
of the country. In a way
the uprising accomplished
its purpose, for Austria
immediately began the
metamorphosis which led
to “anschluss" last year.
July is a month of violence
on the highways and elsewhere.
I n Ju ly 1934-36, the daily average
death toll in the V. S. was
381. compared with 284 for thc
two years as a whole. Drownings
alone average 52 daily in
July. In the first 30 years of
this century. July Fourth fireworks
killed 4.290, compared
with 4,044 killed in the Revolutionary
war. Likewise the 30-
year record showed far more
non-fatal injuries than during
the Revolution.
Hero of Shimonoseki
WH IL E the sloop Natchez was in
the harbor at Pensacola. F la.,
more than a hundred years ago, a
cry of "M a n o verbo ard!" rang
throughout the vessel with unusual
frenzy because sharks had been
swarm ing around the ship in hungry
schools.
While others prepared to launch a
boat, David Stockton McDougal, a
young midshipm an, dived into the
water, swam to the foundering man
and kept him afloat. He churned
the water and was able to frighten
off the sharks until the rescue boat
arrived.
This incident shows the fearless
courage that ruled his adventurous
career in the United States navy.
His exploits came to a climax while
he was commander of the steam
frigate Wyoming during the Civil
war.
Ordered to patrol Asiatic waters
in search of Confederate vessels
preying upon Union commerce, he
found that a greater threat to United
States shipping came from the
Japanese. The Mikado had ordered
all foreigners expelled from Ja pa n
and the surrounding waters. Fanatical
Japanese had already made
several attacks on American vessels
when Commander McDougal
arrived at the Straits of Shimonoseki.
Along the shore were high bluffs
fortified with several batteries ol
heavy artillery. Ahead of him were
three Japanese war vessels. In
spite of the heavy opposition, he
steamed into the straits past the
blazing shore batteries and engaged
the three vessels.
The first fire of the Wyoming sank
two of the ships and then silenced
the third. This allowed McDougal
to turn his attention to the batteries
along the shore. Reversing his
course through the straits, he deliberately
invited continued fire, but silenced
all the Japanese guns.
Had this incident occurred at any
other time than when attention was
centered on Gettysburg and Vicksburg,
the fame of this dauntless
navy officer who fought a good-sized
naval engagement with one ship,
would have rung 'round the world.

‘Brings ’Em Back Alive’
Nl OT so many years ago a mother
' punished her son for trying to
capture a buzzing rattlesnake near
their home in the outskirts of Dallas,
Texas. He wanted it to sell to
a m an in Minneapolis, Minn., who
made snake oil.
When the fam ily moved to Chicago
this young fellow was no longer able
to catch anim als and birds as he
could in Texas. But he often went
to the Lincoln Park zoo to satisfy
his desire to own strange animals.
That was years ago. Now he can
go into almost any zoo or circus
menagerie in the United States and
greet those behind the bars as past
acquaintances. His name is Frank
Buck and wherever there are wild
anim als in captivity in this country,
some of them are there because
"B uck brought ’em back alive.”
Some of the rarest anim als Buck
has ever brought back were obtained,
not only with courage, but
with this friendly diplomacy. His
skill in handling the native people
of the jungle nnd his ability to make
friends with Oriental potentates account
for his opportunities to go
where anim als are to be had.
Among thc strange people with
whom he deals, he is a great “ tuan”
or chief—both to the coolies of the
Malay peninsula and to the rajahs
of India. But more important of
all, perhaps, is that he no longer
has any fear of his mother punishing
h im for catching snakes.

Emperor Norton
IN 1858 Joshua A. Norton, wearing
a poorly fitting navy officer's u niform
set off with gold braid, and
with a saber at his belt, rode a bicycle
up Market street in San F rancisco.
He stopped at a m ain corner
and said to the crowd: " I proclaim
myself Norton I, Emperor of the
United States and Protector of Mexico."
There was no doubt that he was
crazy. But for the next 22 years,
until he died in 1880, the people of
San Francisco paid respect to the
•'Em peror," who was a fam iliar figure
in the streets.
Even the straight-laced bankers
of the day cashed the small notes
the self-styled ruler issued. He
passed them out in restaurants and
stores but none of them ever was
for more than SO cents.
Not only were his requests for
money small, but all the demands
he made as a result of his wide
"a uth ority ” were reasonable — so
reasonable that the people of San
Francisco had no trouble giving in
to them and thus humoring him.
When he died of heart disease on
the cobblestones of Kearny street,
30,000 people heard prominent citizens
praise him for his good character.

not a parvenu nation without a past.
In the California badlands, when
Lawrence Tibbett was 7 years old,
his father, a deputy sheriff, cornered
the bandit, wild Jim McKinney, in a
Chinese joss house in Bakersfield.
At that time, McKinney ranked Billy
the Kid, previously the leading bad
m an in those parts. Shooting his way
out, he killed Tibbett. Tibbett's
brother, Bert, then sheriff of Bakersfield,
stepped in in time to land a
load of buckshot between the bandit's
eyes.
Just the other day, Lawrence
Tibbett's t'nrle Bert gave him
the shotgun which had dropped
McKinney. The boy had a hard
scramble, getting an education
and helping support his widowed
mother and. at long last—speaking
ln the manner of the house
• f Windsor—here's another distinctive
American touch—Lawrence
Tibbett is the first American
singer to gain fame without
European training.
Betty Lee Tibbett, his sister,
taught h im his flrst songs, and how
to play the piano. Joseph Dupuy,
the southern California tenor, was
_ , his first profes-
I a Res on a I sional teacher.
And Lack Doe* Hc knew he had
A Happy Turn a voice, but was
determined to
be a Shakespearian actor. However,
his fame as a singer grew in Los
Angeles, and hc began studying with
F rank LaForge in New York. On
Ja n u a ry 2, 1925, he stole the show
from Scotti, in Verdi’s “ Falstaff.”
The record shows one score for the
numerologists. His luck wasn’t so
good until he added another “ t " to
his name—it is properly Tibbet.
There's still another touch ot
quaint Americana in Mr. Tibbett's
story. Whenever he has a
headache, he walks around on
his hands. He says that sluices
the blood out of his head and
stops the pain. Many a time, just
before he was to sing a specially
exacting role, members of the
Metropolitan cast have seen him
off stage, running around upside
down. Our reception to the king
and queen was necessarily routined,
hut they would have
learned much of interest if they
could have circulated in disguise
like good King Alfred who

LOCAL FARMERS
CAN EARN MORE
ACP PAYMENTS
Lists Practices Eligible for Benefit
Checks
$46,804.05 were earned by Shawano
county farmers as aid in carrying out
soil building practices in 1938, reports
O. B. Hagen, county chairman. The
principal practices on which payments
were earned were seedings of 34,742.3
acres of grasses and legumes and applications
of 5,294.2 tons of limestone,
marl, or other substitutes.
There is one figure in the county report
for 1938 that is considered as bad
news to those interested in building up
our Shawano county soils. Officials of
the AAA report that $15,991.82 that
was available to aid participating
farmers in Shawano county in seeding,
liming, fertilization, and other soil
building practices was lost because
aome farmers failed to carry out the
necessary practices. On a great many
farms, it ia aaid, there was no soil
practicea carried out and hence the
entire soil building allowance for such
farms was lost.
In 1939, there will be approximately
$62,800 available in the county as
assistance in the soil building program.
All farm operators and farm
owners are being urged to make every
effort to qualify for their maximum
soil building payment by carrying out
sufficient practicea.
The principal practices listed by
County Agent G. F. Baumeister as
qualifying for payment are (1) appli
cations of ground limestone, marl, a
other substitutes for limestone; (2)
seedings of practically all biennial and
perennial grasses and legumes
(3) pasture improvement by reseeding
or by non-grazing until after seed
ripens; (4) erosion control practices
of constructing terraces, soil and
water saving dams and reservoirs,
strip cropping and contour planting
and cultivation; and (5) planting trees
for windbreak, shelterbelt or forests.
For further information on soil
building practices or earnings for
carrying them out, loca^ farmers are
being asked to see local conservation
committeemen or visit the county
office at Shawano.
A searching, human document
painted in bold strokes against a
unique background, RKO Radio’s “ Boy
Slaves,” is interpreted by a memorable
cast of youthful players. Anne
Shirley and Roger Daniel, a fourteenyear-
old newcomer, have featured
roles, with seven talented youngsters
from the New York stage prominently
cast. The picture presents them all
as homeless, penniless outcasts who
are rehabilitated only after sharing
the horrors of a viciously run turpentine
camp and virtual slavery.
Added attraction is “The Oklahoma
Kid," W’arner Bros.’ stirring calvacade
of America’s westward march, starring
James Cagney. Also featured in
the cast are Humphrey Bogard, Rosemary
Lane, Donald Crisp and Harvey
Stephens. It is against an altogether
different type of background than is
