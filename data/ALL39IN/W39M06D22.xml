FORTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG. SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN. THURSDAY. JUNE 22. 19.19 NUMBER 31
Reorganization Stalled
Republican reorganization of state
government appears to have stalled in
mid-stream. Months ago bills which
proposed drastic changes in important
state boards and commissions were introduced
and have had public hearings.
To date none but a few minor changes,
and most of those reenactments of La
Follette orders, have been effected.
The transformation to one-man commissions
of the present three-man
boards of the tax commission, public
service commission, and highway commission
still lacks engrossment by
either house of the legislature.
The senate, upper branch of the legislature,
has been stalled for two
weeks on matters of reorganization
and pensions, and has accomplished
nothing. Last week in lfi hours of
session only two bills were passed—
one liberalizing unemployment insurance
laws and the other appropriating
$ 15,000 for fur and mink research at
the university.
The strong Republican-Democrat
coalition in the senate, which functioned
so well on labor legislation and
the budget, has crumpled because
Democrats are cautious over the highway
commission reorganization now
headed by Chairman Wm. E. O ’Brien,
a Democrat. In fact. Republican floor
leaders have had to use every parliamentary
maneuver at their command
in order to postpone final vote on public
service commission and highway
commission bills because they lack the
necessary votes for passage.
In the assembly where Republicans
hold a majority the bill by Speaker
Thomson which proposes to revamp
the present tax commission is expected
to come up for a vote this week.
Asks Legislature to Recess
The state legislature was asked
Tuesday by Senator Marry W. Bolens,
Democrat, to recess until September
15 “so that the governor and the members
of the legislature ‘may take the
advice and get the consent of. the
governed’ before we put an additional
burden of 22 million dollars on the
employable group.” He also asked
that a bill fixing all state taxes as
they are now until November 1, 1939,
and prohibiting further commitments
by the highway commission until fu rther
action by the legislature be
passed.
Making known his intentions in a
16-page pamphlet addressed to the
governor and members of the legislature,
Bolens criticized the levying of
22 million dollars in new taxes. He
also asked that the 34 million dollars
annually collected in automobile license
fees and gas taxes be used by
the state for whatever purposes it
sees fit rather than ju st for highway
construction and improvement.
Public hearings on thc newly proposed
tax measures are expected to
be concluded this week. The first
hearing last week brought strong protests
from liquor, beer and wine interests.
New Bureau Begins
The state securities division, created
in 1919 and recently shuffled back and
forth from the public service commission
to the banking commission, has
been succeeded by a new independent
department of securities.
From the time of its creation in
1919 until January 10, 1938, the securities
division was under the public
service commission. On that date it
was transferred to the banking commission
by executive order of Governor
La Follette under powers granted
by the 1937 legislature. The 1939
legislature, however, vetoed La Follette’s
executive order and on January
14 of this year the division returned
to the public service commission.
Shortly after a law was passed which
made the division a new department.
Governor Heil has appointed Vernon
Zeller of Milwaukee department director.
Job Insurance Changes
Both houses of the legislature this
week passed and sent on to Governor
Heil for signature a bill which will extend
the maximum period of benefit
payments to 17 13 weeks instead of
the 13 week period now in effect. The
bill will also reduce the waiting period
for job insurance benefits from three
weeks, the present waiting period, to
two weeks.
Another provision of the law, which
sought to cover all employers of four
or more persons by 1941, was stricken
from the bill by an amendment offered
by Senator Peters, Hartford Republican.
An amendment by Senator Coller,
Necedah Republican, which proposed
to make the law conform to the
federal act and cover only those employers
who have eight or more employes,
was defeated. The law now
applies to employers of 6 or more persons.
Changes in the law were recommended
to the legislature by the advisory
committee of the unemployment
commission. The committee is
made up of representatives of employers,
labor and the industrial commission.
Farmers Approve AAA
From Harry O. Wells, chairman of
the Wisconsin A A A , last week came
the news that 88 per cent of the 193,-
000 farmers in Wisconsin have voted
to comply with the agricultural adjustment
act for the new year. As a
result, 92 per cent of the state’s crop
acres will be covered by this year's
program, and Wisconsin will have one
of the best compliance records in the
north central tier of states, according
to the state A A A chief.
New AG Board
After confirmation of Chairman
Herman Ihde and his colleagues on
the new board of agriculture by the
state senate, the state’s farm department
began functioning last week
under new generalship.
The first act of the new Heil appointed
board was the retention of

Seriously Injured
in Auto Accident
William Schnableger, of Green Bay,
was brought to the hospital in Shawano
Monday afternoon with serious
injuries from an accident which traffic
officers said occurred when his car left
the road in the curve on highway 29
near the Bernarde place about six
miles east of Wittenberg.
Schnableger, a young man employed
as a window trimmer by the Gateway
Liquor company of Green Bay, was on
his way to Wausau. Overdue for an
appointment in Wausau, he was driving
his car at great speed when it got
out of control at the curve. The car
turned over many times and was badly
wrecked.
Confirmation Services at
Local Churches Sunday
Beautiful and impressive confirmation
services were held on Sunday at
St. Paul’s Lutheran church and at the
Methodist church. It was a fitting
tribute to the fathers that such services
should be held on that day—
Fathers’ Day.
A t St. Paul’s church, the pastor,
Rev. G. F. Fierke, officiating, the following
adults were confirmed: Henry
Schoepke, Ed. Schoepke, Mrs. Guy
Vance, Al Neerdaels and Mrs. Byron
Koeppen. Two adults, Mrs. Arthur
Kersten and Guy Vance, were baptized.
Besides these two adults three
infants were baptized during these
services: Daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Guy Vance, named Patricia Louise;
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Ed. Liskow,
named La Vonne May; son of Mr. and
Mrs. Reinert Albrecht, named Allen
John.
At the Methodist church, the following
eight boys and girls were confirmed
by the pastor, Rev. Ralph W.
Hawkins: Robert Cappel, Ann Evenson,
Barbara Farmer, Darrel Farmer,
Johnnie Larson, Richard Netzel,
Roland Rothman ami James Sensenbrenner.
Rev. Hawkins’ sermon was based
upun the text: “I am come that ye may
have life and that ye may have it
abundantly.” His thought was that to
have an abundant life one must practice
the principles of Jesus and that in
trying to do His will one will never
be out of date or old-fashioned.
Many Attend Festival
The summer school festival at Bethany
Mission Sunday was an enjoyable
affair for many people, local and
from a distance, who had the pleasure
of hearing an excellent sermon by the
Rev. R. W. Peterson, of Glenwood
City, the songs by the Oneida Indian
Choir, the dinner served at the noon
hour and the afternoon program with
its Scripture reading and prayers,
songs and recitations by Indian children,
catechization of the confirmation
class, and remarks by the Rev. E. W.
Sihler.
The Rev. P. A. Wahl was the liturgist
at the forenoon services. Following
the sermon by the Rev. Peterson
(a son of the late Rev. Peterson, for
many years pastor in Green Bay and
ofttimes a visitor in Wittenberg many
years ago) and the singing of a hymn,
a substantial offering was made by
those present to support the Christian
summer school for the Indians now
being conducted here.
Those in charge of the afternoon
program, besides the Rev. Sihler, were
Miss Olga Baker, of Eau Claire, Miss
Edna Berg, of Reeder, North Dakota,
Eugene Hanson, of Iola, Miss Helen
Garlie, of Eau Claire, Rev. Waldo
Wold, of Little Falls, Minnesota, and
David Doxtator, of this -community.
The visiting teachers are giving four
weeks of their time here, serving
without pay, out of a genuine interest
in mission work among the Indians.
COUNTY WHEAT ALLOTMENT
IS 2,164 ACRES
Shawano county’s wheat allotment
for 1940 will be 2,054 acres, announces
O. B. Hagen, chairman of the county
agricultural conservation committee.
Because the county allotments are
available nearly two months earlier
this year farmers, it is explained, will
have their farm allotments well in advance
of the winter planting season.
Participation in all phases of the
national wheat program is based on
the farm wheat allotment. By receiving
his allotment before planting time,
a farmer, it is pointed out, can plan
his farm operations so that he will
become eligible for conservation payments
and wheat loans when they are
made. He can also take out crop insurance
upon as much wheat acreage
as his allotment provides.
The state allotment has been set at
99,128 acres which is 9.9 percent
larger than the 1939 allotment of
90,203 acres, Mr. Hagen reported.
Nearly 38,000 farmers in Wisconsin
are expected to participate in this
year's program.
Mission Hill News
Rev. E. W. Sihler went to Manitowoc
last Tuesday and gave an address
on the Indian Mission at a Mothers
and Daughters Banquet of the Valders
congregation, Rev. Fretheim’s charge.
He returned Wednesday morning.
Mrs. Sihler and Susan went to
Chicago last Thursday night and re
turned to Wittenberg on the 9:53
train Friday evening. Mrs. Sihler
spoke at the Summer Luncheon of the
Chicago Circuit of the Women’s Missionary
Federation of the Norwegian
Lutheran Church of America. The
luncheon was given at the Medina
Club.
In spite of overcast skies, the Bethany
church was well filled Sunday
morning and afternoon. Here at the
Mission we felt well satisfied with the
day and were thankful to the Lord and
to the friends of the Mission for the
happy fellowship.
Miss Esther Lindelien, play ground
supervisor, is called by most of the
children, “The Red-Headed Woman”,
although one girl called her “ Red
Hairs.” Miss Lindelien is collecting
dogs as a hobby. She now has 403
dogs from 33 states. Wherever she
goes, she buys a dog— none with barks
and none with pants. They are all
sizes, shapes and kinds, from those of
fur to those of cloth, from fragile
blown glass to heavy pottery and
clay. About 2 years ago she heard of
someone who had over 60 elephants.
She had a number of dogs; and so
gathering them into one place she set
about making a collection.
Mr. and Mrs. Waldo Wold attended
the installation of Rev. Hill in his
parish at Amherst Sunday evening.
Rev. Hill completed his Seminary
training this spring.
The school boys are the wood carriers.
Little Hershel Hill is a very
faithful worker and comes trudging
into the kitchen with one stick of wood
in each hand—if the sticks are small.
If a stick is large, he carries one stick
with both hands.
Chinese checkers is the attraction
each evening for our teachers and it
seems Miss Garlie carries off the
laurels most frequently.
Miss Mathison and Miss Berg report
that the girls who have been 111
with colds are improving.
Thc B. I. M. Circle met at the Girls’
Building Tuesday afternoon and
mended clothes. The ladies decided to
have a picnic in July in the Elderon
Park and invite their husbands.
Mrs. Swenson is wondering how she
can make breakfast menus sufficiently
tempting to rouse the heavy-eyed
teachers in the morning. Now, I ’m
sure Mrs. Swenson reads the breakfast
food ads and listens to the radio,
but so far she hasn’t found the magic
combination. We have suggested that
she adopt Paul Bunyan’s method. He
ran a pipe from cook shack to bunk
shack. When the coffee began to boil
and the bacon to sizzle, the tempting
aroma of the food brought the men to
breakfast more promptly than a dozen
alarm clocks could have.
This week the children are studying
“The Sacrament of the A ltar” and
“Our Responsibilities as Children of
God.” In a couple of rooms each child
has a kite with a long tail. When a
child memorizes a scripture passage
he copies it on a slip of paper and
attaches the paper to the tail. One
little girl said she had memorized 1C
Scripture passages.
Rev. and Mrs. Midtlien, Mrs. Long
and Miss Hagen of Stanley were visitors
at the Mission Monday. They
brought with them two large cheeses
from two ladies’ aids in the country
near Stanley and some canned fruit.
This is the third year Stanley folks
have sent cheeses to the school.
The Bethany Indian Mission Committee
met Monday morning with Rev.
R. W. Peterson, Rev. Midtlien, Rev.
Johnson and Rev. Sihler present. Mrs.
G. A. Sundby was unable to be present
because of the death of Rev. Sundby’s
father Sunday, June 18. As the board
was about to meet, Rev. Johnson was
taken ill. Dr. Evenson recommended
that he take a vacation as soon as
possible since he is exhausted by his
heavy duties. Rev. Johnson has four
congregations and serves on two of
the boards of the Wittenberg Institutions.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA:
Rebellion
Last March Adolf Hitler marched
into Prague while stolid Czechs
lined the streets and booed hatefully.
Unnoticed were thousands of
Bohemians and Moravians who
slipped silently across the borders.
Unconsidered were 12 Czech legations
and some 70 consulates which
remained open throughout the world
in defiance of German orders. Forgotten
was the national assembly’s
failure to dissolve. These thing3
might well have remained unnoticed,
unconsidered and forgotten were it
not for the indomitable Czech will.
Symbolically, a few days after
Nazi occupation, spiteful Czechs
painted on a rock overlooking
Prague: “ We don’t want your pfennigs!
We want Benes!” The reference
was to Eduard Benes, cofounder
of the Czech republic 25
years ago with immortalized Thomas
G. Masaryk; later the nation’s
president until he resigned after the
Munich crisis; now a lecturer at the
University of Chicago who wonders
if the Czech saga will repeat itself.
Recalled today is Czecho-Slov
a k ia’s constitution, written in Chicago,
and its declaration of inde-
BARON VON N E IR A T H
The question: To slap or pvt?
pendence, adopted in Philadelphia.
Born first outside its own borders
by idealistic exiles, will Thomas
Masaryk’s land be re-born in Chicago?
Three months after Czechoslovakia
fell, such a development
seemed possible. At Prague, Germ
an Konstantin von Neurath lost
sleep over a maddening passive resistance
on the part of his subjects.
Rushing to Berlin, he consulted
with Fuehrer Hitler over two
methods of fighting back. Germany
could either dominate Bohemia and
Moravia by force, or try to reconcile
the Czechs by encouraging
more intimate cultural and political
relations with Germany.
W'hat he cannot reconcile, however,
is the patriotic fervor of
Czechs outside the Reich. In
France are a reported 30,000 exiles
waiting to enlist for The Cause.
Other thousands are in Poland,
planning a swift military seizure of
Bohemia-Moravia should Germany
become involved in war.
At her consulates and legations
the defunct Czech government maintains
a semblance of official contact
with other lands, an advantage not
possessed during the flrst nationalistic
struggle. And from Chicago Dr.
Benes is directing a world-wide
mobilization of Czech moral and
financial support, carefully avoiding
open commitments which would
“ add to the difficulties of the (U
S.) President and department of
state.”
DOMESTIC:
Inromp
President Roosevelt’s goal for total
U. S. income is $80,000,000,000 a
year, which critics say would not
necessarily guarantee prosperity
since living costs might rise correspondingly.
In 1929 the national
income was $82,000,000,000, by 1932
it had dropped to $40,000,000,000,
and returning prosperity brought it
to $72,000,000,000 in 1937. Just released
is thc figure for 1938, showing
an 11 per cent drop to $64,000,000,-
000.
Best explanation of the drop, said
Secretary of Commerce Harry Hopkins,
was declining prices, coupled
with reduced volume of production.
More significant, however, were
1938's results of 1937's capital-labor
battle, during which John Lewis' C.
I. O. squeezed out higher salaries
and expanded unionism. Net result:
Labor gamed and capital lost.
One index was the fact that compensation
to employees for 1938
was off only 7 per cent from the
previous year, while dividend payments
to stockholders in corporations
dropped approximately onethird
from the $5,400,000,000 level
of 1937. An even better index, however,
was that income distribution
in wages set a new high m ark of
87.3 per cent in 1938.
Another significant feature:
The construction industry, which
has suffered severely since 1929,
showed very little decline in
1938, indicating that U. S. housing
requirements have reached so critical
a stage that not even recession
can stop new building.
AGRICULTURE:
Netv Uses
One major reason for today’s
U. S. crop surpluses was the World
war. Then, and before, both the
agriculture department and farm ers
bent their energies to establishing
a production level that would
accommodate an export market
which annually took from 150 to 200
million bushels of wheat, eight to
nine million bales of cotton, almost
a billion pounds of pork, plus
large quantities of tobacco and fruit.
Since then three factors have conspired
to upset farm economy. First,
U. S. export requirements were cut
drastically as other nations became
self-sufficient; second, agriculture
became mechanized, cutting farm
employment and making it easier
to raise large crops; third, unscientifically
tilled land "burned out”
from too much repetition of the
same crop.
No cure-all, but an encouraging
move in the right direction will be
underway by next summer when
four regional laboratories begin
seeking ways to make the farm a
source of raw materials for factories.
Authorized by congress and
operating under the department of
agriculture will be laboratories at:
Peoria. III., researching on corn,
wheat and agricultural wastes,
much of which is already used for
such purposes as industrial alcohol.
New Orleans, where new uses will
be sought for cotton, sweet potatoes
and peanuts
Wyndmoor, Pa., centering its activities
on tobacco, m ilk products,
apples, Irish potatoes and vegetables.
San Francisco, studying wheat,
potatoes, alfalfa, vegetables and
fruits.
COURTS:
Offsetting Factor
Vacationing from their Washington
temple nowadays are the Supreme
court's nine young and old
men, as unique a mixture of legal
talent as ever donned the traditional
black robes. Abed with a doudenal
ulcer is Chief Justice Hughes; visiting
his old Kentucky home is Ju s tice
McReynolds; still in Washington,
close to such friends as S E C ’s
Jerome Frank and Brain Truster
Tommy Corcoran is the court’s
youngest and most un-traditional
member, 44-year-old Bill Douglas.
Gloating, meanwhile, is Solicitor
General Robert H. Jackson, whom
observers credit with winning 12 out
of 14 bouts with the high bench this
past term. Yet in retrospect the
session just ended was neither a
capitulation by the Supreme court
POLITICS:
Plan?
Whatever his reasoning, President
Roosevelt has shown political
wisdom in refusing to announce his
intentions for 1940. But campaigns
and conventions must eventually
settle the Democratic party’s political
stew, and by early June cam paign
time was so near that thirdterm
talk was definitely in the picture.
Enough other Democrats had
talked to give the voting public their
choice of two probable reasons why
the White H o u m continued to rem
ain silent:
Resolution. West Virginia’i Sen.
Rush D. Holt began demanding that
the senate vote on his resolution forbidding
a third term. Until that
vote was made, Mr. Roosevelt could
hardly be expected to declare h im self;
if the resolution were passed
after he announced his candidacy,
the President would go down in
history as a villain, not a hero.
Contrariwise, it the resolution were

nor a victory for the New Deal. A
better guess is that the once notorious
poles of court conservatism
and New Deal liberalism have
grown less far apart.
Four Roosevelt appointees (Black,
Reed, Frankfurter, and Douglas)
have given the court liberalized color
and today only two conservatives
(Butler and McReynolds) remain.
Middle-grounders are Hughes, Stone
and Roberts, and Mr. Jackson had
to convince only one of these to
assure victory in any given case.
Yet, paradoxically, the recent term
brought a new high in dissents and
divisions of opinions, a condition
which proves that New Dealish justices
have merely added zest to
court arguments, and that they have
not yet settled into a rut which perm
its observers to classify them in
advance.
While the court grows more liberal,
an important offsetting factor
too often overlooked is the lesson
Mr. Roosevelt’s administration
learned through disastrous defeats
of the past. Today’s legislation is
drafted more carefully and with
greater respect for constitutional
precedent.
SE C R ET A R Y ICKES
He doesn’t Uke Mr. Corner.
rejected, Mr. Roosevelt knew the
public would regard the rejection
as a vote of confidence from the senate,
thus paving the way for renomination.
Confusion. F ar more pertinent,
however, is another reason. While
Mr. Roosevelt keeps quiet, all other
Democratic hopefuls are scrambling
into the exciting political dogfight,
knifing each other in a way that can
never bring party harmony.
First (and b£st liked) hopeful to
speak was Vice President John N.
Garner, whose friends announced he
would be “ available.” Within 48
hours he was pounced on by: (1)
Secretary of the Interior Harold L.
Ickes, who called him by inference
a “ know nothing, say nothing, do
nothing” ; (2) Workers Alliance, ,
which adopted a resolution condemning
Mr. Garner as representing
a poverty-stricken mass of people;
(3) San Antonio’s Mayor Maury
Maverick, former congressman,
who objected chiefly to Mr. G a rner's
age (70).
Meanwhile Secretary of Agriculture
Henry Wallace had his name
added to a list of second choices
already cluttered with those of Postmaster
General Jam es A. Farley,
In dian a’s former Gov. P aul V. McNutt
and aging Secretary of State
Cordell Hull, who has long been
mentioned as a possibility.
Immediate result was probably
just what the President wanted, a
recognition by many Democrats
that the Garner-Hull-Farley-Wallace-
McNutt candidacies merely produced
an utter confusion which
could have but one logical solution
at convention tim e: Ju nk them all
and nominate Franklin Roosevelt
again.
If this was not the case, observers
at least saw something significant
in Mr. Ickes’ article in Look m ag azine,
in which he plumped for a
third term. Extremely close to the
White House, the vitriolic secretary
of the interior was not likely to
make such a statement unless he
knew the President was at least
toying with the idea of running
again.
FAIRS:
Attendance
Closer to large populations. New
York’s World’s fair would naturally
draw larger attendance than its rival
at San Francisco. By June 1,
after running 3 4 months, the Gold
en Gate exposition reported attendance
of 3,284,329. In one month,
from April 30 to June 1. New Y ork’s
turnstiles spun to the tune of 5,594,-
770.
More interesting to executives of
both fairs was the source of attendance,
for local visitors add little
to the prosperity of either San F rancisco
or New York. At the Golden
Gate, a checkup of parking lots revealed
85 per cent of visitors were
from California. Of out-of-state visitors,
55 per cent came from nearby
Washington, Oregon, Arizona, Nevada,
etc.
Closest comparable estimate at
New York came from the Goodrich
exhibit, which offered replica auto
tags to the estimated 20 per cent
total attendance which visited the
Transportation area. Judging from
auto tag sales, 49 per cent of the
fair's visitors were from New York.
Others: New Jersey, 15 per cent;
Pennsylvania, 6.5 per cent; Massachusetts,
4.5 per cent; Connecticut,
4.5 per cent. Only states not registered
on June I : North and South
Dakota.
Though both surveys showed early
attendance was localized, both
fairs also predicted mid-summer
vacation season would bring visitors
from afar.
WASHINGTON.—It is now obvious
that John Nance Garner is a
real candidate for the Democratic
nomination for President next year
whether President Roosevelt chooses
to run for a third term or not.
Incidentally, there is one mystery
about Garner* which ought to be
cleared up right now. He is far
from being a sphinx, just as Calvin
Coolidge was far from being a
sphinx. But Garner is and Coolidge
was protected from quotation by a
simple rule governing his relations
with newspaper men Coolidge
would talk to them, and let his views
be stated, but under no circum stances
could quotation marks be
used.
It was to get around this difficulty
that the newspaper men, while Coolidge
was President, invented the
m ythical “ White House Spokesm
a n .” Lots of people throughout
the country assumed that there really
was a “ Spokesman.” They were
right. It was Calvin Coolidge.
Ju s t so, in the present instance,
when newspaper men hear that G a rner
is advocating something, or doing
something, and ask him about
it, they cannot put quotation marks
around what Garner says in reply.
But they can print the answers, and
they can say that Garner said them.
In fact sometimes they stretch it a
bit, for Garner very obviously has
another political rule in addition to
avoiding direct quotations, which
is that he denies nothing.
There was a slip-up on this, incidentally,
a few days ago in connection
with the Hatch bill to outlaw
participation in the election of government
workers in the elections of
federal officers (the original bill
would have made possible participation
in primaries and the election of
delegates to national conventions
as well). A ycung reporter assumed
because Garner did not say
he could not be quoted as saying
this bill would be “ law before we
quit” that it was all right to quote
him . So he did.
Neter Any Difficulty in
Finding How (lamer Stands
But while the old New York World
attacked Coolidge bitterly for putting
out propaganda under quotation
marks assigned to the “ White
House Spokesman” present critics
of Garner, in magazine articles and
elsewhere, are attacking the vice
president on the other flank. They
are assuming that he really never
says anything. Naturally G arner’s
other rule, about no denials, protects
them in this inaccuracy. A
denial would sound sort of silly anyhow.
But the truth is that any reputable
newspaper man in Washington has
very little difficulty in finding out
where Garner stands on anything,
though he will come home without
the bacon if his editor insists on
quotation marks.
Another type of comment from
New Deal sources which Garner has
had to take, or break his rule by
denying, is that he is really in full
j sympathy with the New Deal, and
! that all the newspaper stories about
{ his being the brains behind some of
the anti-New Deal strategy on Capitol
Hill are the bunk.
This has about ended, however,
for the simple reason that it has
been so obvious what Garner did
in the court fight, his attitude about
| “ letting the cattle get a little fat
on them,” referring to business,
| (this was said to the President face
to face by Garner more than a
| year ago and was quoted to newspaper
men by others present) and
his known views and activities in
j other controversies, that to write
! any more about his being a 100 per
I cent New Dealer would merely
! make the writer absurd.
I Try to Prevent Opening Up
O f General Tax Situation
Democratic leaders in congress
are doing their utmost to prevent
any further opening up of the gen-
I eral tax situation. For instance,
; Chairman Robert Doughton of the
i house ways and means committee
! has been flooded with requests for
l a brief hearing from various indusi
tries which are being subjected to
special taxation, ju st as radios (5
per cent), Doughton has crisply told
one and all that there is no desire
to hear testimony on this, and has
refused requests even, for as brief
a period as 10 minutes. (This happens
to be the time the radio industry
requested.)
The average person who buys a
radio, of course, does not realize
that he or she is paying any tax at
; all. The radio people would like to
• have a partial exemption. They
claim that they find a certain competition
in other house furnishings
and appliances. Thus, they contend,
they would like to have the
cabinet containing the radio exempted,
because as an article of furniture
it is, in a sort of a way, competing
in the housewife's mind with
a fancy table to occupy a particular
corner.
They also com plain of another
type of competition. The family
budget may be such that it is a question
of whether to buy a radio or
a washing machine. O f course, the
latter is not taxed, while the radio
is taxed 5 per cent.
“ Now w hat’s the use of taking up
the committee’s tim e with an argument
like tha t?” an old member
said to a young radio man. “ You
know perfectly well you could not
get anywhere. All we could do
would be to decide that as between
the purchase of an article to save
the good wife’s back and a radio
the government had no choice but to
encourage the washing m achine.”
Business Interests Hold
Their Fire for the Senate
As a matter of fact, however,
most business interests having an
idea that they m igh t get somewhere
in the tax changes are not figuring
on the house at all. They are holding
their fire for the senate. There
are two reasons for this. One is
that the house is determined to rush
some sort of tax bill through. Until
that is done the business interests
won’t know exactly what they have
to fight against, and what to fight
for.
For example, if their proposition
is contained in the house bill as it
is passed, then all they have to do
is to watch to see that the senate
does not strike it out. Anyway, they
would have a chance in conference
when the drafts of the bills as
passed by the house and senate are
adjusted by the conferees.
If their proposition is not contained
in the house draft, then they
will have more time, and more opportunity,
to work for a change by
the senators. Almost any industry
can count on active support from a
few senators—if from no one else
than from the senators from the
states in which their industries are
active. Besides, one senator can
often force changes in any bill. For
one thing he can discuss the matter
on the floor, taking up the senate's
time, until the cows come home, a
privilege which the individual m em ber
of the house does not have. The
representative’s time is doled out
to h im in very sm all doses and
with even the subject matter restricted.
Important Facts Gleaned
At /. C. C. Freight Hearing
Nobody paid much attention to
hearings conducted by the interstate
commerce commission in which the
operators on the old E rie canal—
the New York Barge canal to be
exact — protested against the cut
in freight rates on grain by the railroads
from New York to BufTalo.
Actually the hearings brought out
some facts which are not only highly
im portant to everybody in this
country who pays taxes, but have a
very definite bearing on several m a jor
proposals in the offing, including
the St. Lawrence seaway, TVA, river
development all over the country,
public power, etc.
What the railroads did was to reduce
the rate per bushel on grain
from Buffalo to New York from 6.7
cents to 5 cents flat. The canal
operators claimed that this would
ruin them—that they had to have a
differential under the railroad rates
because of the longer time required,
higher insurance, etc.
The funny part of the whole business
is that the railroads didn't
make that cut in grain rates this
sum m er in order to take business
from the Barge canal. They did it
to get some of the business back
which the Canadians have been taking
from them, and taking, incidentally,
without the aid of a St. Lawrence
seaway, for which Uncle Sam
would ppy half the cost.
Canadians Grab Shipment
Of American-Grown Wheat
Last year, it was testified, 77,000,-
000 bushels of American wheat were
shipped abroad through Canadian
ports, as against only 30,000,000
bushels shipped via United States
ports. The percentage of wheat
which moved through the United
States ports to export in 1932 was
76. In 1938 this had shrunk to 28
per cent. Bear in m ind that in all
instances these quantities and percentages
of wheat refer exclusively
to wheat grown in the United States.
Canadian wheat moved, of course,
almost exclusively through Canadian
ports.
The American city most interested
in all this, of course, is Buffalo.
The big idea of the Barge canal
was to make commerce through
Buffalo. New York state has spent
untold millions with this objective,
first to build the original Erie canal,
before it was realized that the ra ilroads
were to become the big
freight movers of the country, and
before trucks were conceived, and
then later to make the waterway a
big modern development, when it
was rechristened the Barge canal.
Like so many other waterways,
however, the results have never
justified the expectations. It is not
fair to criticize the original concept,
because that was before anyone
realized what the railroads would
become. It seemed then that wheat
and other goods from the Great
Lakes region and westward, moving
by water to BufTalo, and then
trans-shipped to barges for New
York, would provide a growing tide
of commerce ample to justify the
expenditure.

bandit who mumbled his words
through a white handkerchief he
held over his face held up two M ilwaukee
drug stores and escaped with
$600. Victims told police that he gave
the impression that he was seeking
relief for a nose bleed when he entered
their stores. A pistol in one

Band B ill is Rejected — Even
though Gov. Heil personally is in terested
in the Murray bill to appropriate
$25,000 to send the 75-piece
University of Wisconsin band to the
New York and San Francisco fairs,
the joint finance ®ommittee refused
to introduce the bill. Heil had
planned to have the bandsmen toot
for Wisconsin products at the fairs
as well as at stops en route.
Storm Causes Heavy Damage —
A terrific gale swept Barron county
causing property damage that may
reach more than $100,000. It was
estimated that the wind caused d am age
to more than three-fourths of
the county’s farms. About 100 barns
and sheds were blown down, and
chimneys were toppled from homes.
Many cattle were reported killed.
O nly one person was slightly injured.
Milwaukee Utility Gets Award —
Setting a world’s record in producing
electricity at low cost and
achieving distinctive progress in
sales promotion, financing and employe
relations, the Electric Co. of
Milwaukee was named the outstanding
company in 1938 in the
electric utility industry in the United
States. The company was awarded
the Charles A. Coffin gold medal
and $1,000, the highest honor in the
industry.
Governor Signs Budget B ill—Gov.
Heil signed the biennial budget bill
enacted by the legislature, vetoing
one small item, which left the state
budget at $67,672,307 for the two
years starting June 1, 1939. The governor
struck from the budget bill a
$7,125 appropriation for flood control
planning on the Milwaukee river.
While falling far below the more
than $90,000,000 asked by the various
state departments and institutions,
the budget nevertheless increases
charitable, pension and educational
aids over the last biennium.
Sales Tax Abandoned — Gov. Heil,
with his proposal for a general sales
tax discarded, is working on a new
tax measure calling for drastic in creases
in income taxes and new
levies on “nonessentials.” Republican
legislators who met with the
governor voted unanimously against
the general sales tax proposal. The
new bill would increase taxes on
liquor, beer and wines: new taxes
on cigarettes, tobacco, amusements,
soft drink syrups, automobile sales;
and reduction of exemptions so as
to broaden the base of the normal
tax on incomes, the 60 per cent surtax
on incomes for old age assistance
and the teachers’ fund surtax
on inc mes; and re-enactment of expiring
taxes on dividends and chain
stores at higher rates.

C H A P T E R V—Continued
Someone knocked on the door, and
he called an invitation. “ Hello,
D o c !” he exclaimed then, rising to
m ake introductions. “ Tope, this is
Doctor Derrie, our medical examiner
out here. And this is Mr.
Jervies, Doc. He gave Miss Leaford
a lift, on her way to get Doctor
Cabler, last night.”
Doctor Derrie looked at C lint with
a sidelong eye. “ I'v e just been talking
to Miss Leaford.” he remarked.
He was not m uch older than Clint.
“ Where?” C lint asked, on his feet
instantly.
“ At the house,” the Medical Exam
ine r explained. “ I went up with
Doctor Cabler. She was the last one
to see her mother alive, and she
was the one to And Mrs. Leaford
dead. So I had to talk to her.”
The others nodded, and Inspector
Heale asked: “ F ind out anything,
Doc? What do you th in k ?”
Doctor Derrie replied, ■ little
pompously. “ Mrs. Leaford had a
headache when she went to bed, and
took some tablets,” he explained.
“ One of the barbituric acids,” he
added, like one who m ust be discreet
to protect his hearers. “ Doctor
Cabler had furnished them to her
for a number of years. Once before
she took three, and was very
ill. Last night she took two. Miss
Leaford prepared them for her. Mrs.
Leaford was afraid of thunder, and
Doctor Cabler thinks that when she
d id n ’t go to sleep as quickly as
she expected, even with a double
dose, she got up and took the rest
of her store of the tablets. Certainly
the bottle they were in is gone.”
They listened soberly; and Inspector
Heale asked: “ Then you say it
was an accident; her own doing?”
Doctor Derrie hesitated, and he
lowered his eyelid wisely. “ Accident,
yes,” he said then. “ I shall
agree with Doctor Cabler that it
was an accidental overdose.” He
added: “ She had been dead for
some time before her daughter
found h e r."
“ Miss Leaford?” C lint prompted;
and Doctor Derrie explained:
“ Y e s." He smiled condescendingly.
“ When the storm broke, she
went in to make sure her mother
was asleep, and found her dead. She
tried to telephone and couldn't raise
anyone, and then the lights went
off and she lost her head, ran down
the road to get Cabler. That was
foolish, and unnecessary, of course,
as long as her mother was already
dead, but she claim s she d id n ’t stop
to think of th a t."
“ Maybe she d idn’t know Mrs.
Leaford was d e ad ," Tope suggested;
but Derrie confidently shook his
head.
"She knew, a ll right,” he explained.
“ That was the flrst thing
she said to Doctor Cabler, that her
mother was dead. He and Mrs.
Cabler got some clothes on her,
gave her some whisky, took her
home in the c a r.” He snapped his
fingers in a sort of amazement.
"M r . and Mrs Hurder hadn’t even
waked u p .” he explained. “ When
Cabler got there, the front door was
open, the hall flooded with ra in ."
“ I saw the light in the hall as I
passed,” C lint remembered.
Doctor Derrie assented. “ Miss
Leaford said the front door blew
open, and the light went out, while
she was trying to telephone. The
light must have come on again after
she left the house.” He rose. “ I ’ll
give them an accident verdict,” he
said, a little complacently. “ Even
if she m eant it, an accident verdict
will be easier on Mr. and Mrs.
H urder.”
C lint came to his feet impatiently.
“ I'd like to see Miss Leaford," he
(a id . " I s she up there now?”
Doctor Derrie shook his head.
“ She went out before I left,” he
(old them. "N o t a bad-looking giri.
I saw her walking off through the
woods behind the house, a t I came
away.”
Inspector Heale volunteered:
"She does a lot of that, walking
around alone. Then there’s a m an
lives in there by the pond, and she’*
pretty friendly with h im .”
Tope asked quickly: “ Where? By
what pond? Who is this m a n ? ”
“ Why, there's a good-sized pond
on the Kenesaw land,” Heale explained.
“ It's pretty, in there. There
was some talk awhile back of opening
it up for house lots, but they
won’t sell the land. This fellow—
name's Glovere—has built himself
a cabin in there.”
"H ow do w'e get to his p lace?"
Tope asked.
Heale explained: “ You go back
toward town till you come to Thayer’s
garage, about two miles from
here. There’s a path just this side
of the garage goes right into the
pond. Thayer will show it to you.”
He moved with them toward the
“ Mother's dead,” the aaid
simply.
door: and he asked uneasily: "W h at
are you after, Tope? I t all looks
plain enough to m e.”
Tope answered m ild ly : “ Well, I
don't like questions unless I know
the answers to them. For instance,
did something happen to the telephone
circuit over the hill last
night? Did something happen to the
electric current? Did the Hurders
most generally bolt their front door
when they went to bed? And why
do folks like those people on the hill
let some one squat on their land the
way you say this Glovere does? And
how does it happen he’s so friendly
with Miss Leaford when she hasn't
got any other friends? And where
did that bottle go?”
Heale grinned and scratched his
head; and Doctor Derrie said, in a
sardonic anger:
“ If you're trying to make a m u rder
out of this, I can tell you where
to start. Miss Leaford put her
mother to bed, gave her the dose.
She was the last one to see Mrs.
Leaford alive and the first to see
her dead. Begin with the g irl!
That’s the place to begin!”
C H A PT E R V I
June Leaford loved her mother,
patiently and tenderly; but there
was something more, an intangible.
Kitty Leaford, whose latter days
were such sad and dreary ones,
had once been gay, once she had
known romance; once for the sake
of love she had dared greatly. Even
June had seen sometimes the glint
of shining arm or in her eyes. A
single valorous action, though it
may fail, and be punished endlessly,
does nevertheless in degree ennoble
the soul; and Kitty Leaford had once
done valiantly.
But now Kitty Leaford was dead,
and June moved like a person in a
nightmare. Doctor Cabler had
brought her home, wrapped in his
greatcoat but drenched and shivering
still; and they found the door
open, the hall half-flooded. They
crept up the stairs like conspirators,
and so came into the room where the
pitiless illum ination of an unshaded
electric bulb revealed this upon the
bed. Dr. Cabler made his brief
examination.
"She is dead, yes,” he said. "B u t
I don’t think we'll wake the old people
just now. The middle of the
night is a cruel time for bad news.
I ’ll go next door and get Kab or Asa
to help me—”
But June said in a cool voice:
"Mother wouldn't like that.”
And without weakness or wavering,
she helped Doctor Cabler do
what was required; not till this was
done would she perm it h im to sum mon
anyone.
She did not know how long It was
before Asa came to her.
"G o to bed, Ju n e ,” he said.
"There's nothing to do here. I can
do that nothing as well as you.”
“ I won't aleep,” she told him .
"G o alo ng ," he insisted. "To
bed."
And she obeyed in a silent submission.
In her own room she realized
that she was still drenched,
wet, cold. She changed into a dry
nightgown and lay down. She expected
to stay sleepless till dawn;
and in fact she did lie long enough
awake to hear the Doctor return,
and hear Aunt Evie in the hall.
Then she fell asleep; and when
she woke, the sun was shining. She
opened her door and saw a strange
m an in a black coat go quietly into
her mother's room and shut the
door behind him.
Below-stairs, when she descended,
a ll these kin of hers were gathered
together. G randm a Hurder was crying
quietly, tears glistening on her
gray cheeks. She sat erectly in
her chair. June as she came downstairs
heard G ra ndm a Bowdon say
in a heavy anger: “ Utterly inconsiderate.
No other word describes
it." And as June entered the room,
Aunt Evie remarked, in her gentle,
whispering voice:
“ I was concerned about Kitty last
night. You remember, she had a
headache. I know what it is to have
headaches. I have suffered myself;
and Kitty was sick with them, really
sick sometimes.”
She continued, in her pitiless soft
tones: “ Kitty resented life so deeply.
And there was always a rebel
in her. She would never be happy.
I am not surprised.”
June stopped in the doorway, Incredulous
and bewildered, trying to
understand the implication in their
words. R a b and Asa were in the
room, but they did not see June.
Grandpa H urder was here in the
hall, walking ceaselessly up and
down. Then Uncle Justus came in
through the kitchen, and said something
about breakfast, in the hollow
voice of the deaf; and G randpa H urder
shouted into his ear:
"K itty ’s d e ad !”
" E h ? ” said Uncle Justus.
Aunt Evie came swiftly past June
and went to silence h im ; and G randm
a Bowdon repeated in a grim anger:
“ She was always selfish. No consideration.”
June cried in passionate stifled
anger: " O h ! ” she strode swiftly
into the room. "W h a t do you
m e an?” she demanded. "W h a t do
you m e a n ? ”
" J u n e ,” said G ra n dm a Bowdon
severely. "M in d how you speak to
m e.”
But Grandpa H urder said sternly
in the doorway: “ Kitty was crucifie
d !" There was the dignity of anger
in h im in this moment. “ Crucified,”
he said. “ Long ago.”
June pressed her hands to her
lips, understanding what it was they
thought. "She d idn’t! She d idn’t ! ”
she cried. She turned to escape;
she went out through the front door.
But there was a garland of ribbons
on the doorknob, so she returned
indoors again. Later she
slipped out of the house, this time
by the side door so as not to see
that garland; she moved directly
away from the house, into the tract
of wooded land behind. Here she
could be alone.
There was a sound at some distance;
and she raised her head,
without other movement, to see
what it was. She saw Asa go quietly
past, a little way off among the
trees, and without seeing her, along
a path that led to the bluff above
the pond, where Uncle J im Glovere
had his cabin; it passed beyond,
down to the highway near Thayer's
filling-station. And of course this
was the way she took when she
went to see Uncle J im .
He would know how to comfort
her. She was deeply fond of Uncle
J im . He was a big. chuckling man,
with an amusing eye. He lived alone
in the cabin by the pond, stayed
there sometimes for months on end,
disappeared sometimes for as long.
He wrote, absurdly, poems.
When she came to the top of tha
knoll, he was still asleep. His cabin
door was open; and he woke when
she darkened the doorway—woka
and looked up and said: "H ullo ,
there, youngster!"
"H ello, Uncle J im ," she said.
He sat up, in yellow pajamas,
and rubbed his eyi's. “ You caught
me napping.” he chuckled. " I was
awake till dawn. Writing a poem
about a thunder-storm.”
She stood beside the cabin door,
her back against the logs, looking
dowo toward the pond while he
dressed hurriedly in the cabin behind
her. He talked steadily, cheerfully;
but she spoke not at all, until
Uncle J im , remarking her long silence,
said behind her:
“ Tongue-tied this morning, June.
What's the m atte r?”
“ Mother’s dead,” she said simply.
Something dropped to the floor, in
the cabin, and silence trembled
there. Then Uncle J im cleared his
throat. “ D e ad ?” he whispered.
"Y e s ,” she told him.
He came close to her shoulder.
"K itty Leaford d ead?" he repeated,
in an incredulous tone.
She turned her head alertly. There
was a sound in the wood; the sound
of voices, then footsteps.
"Someone’s coming,” she said.
He started to speak, then stood silently
beside her in the doorway;
and thus they faced the two men
who climbed the trail.
A young m an came in front; and
now the color flowed across Ju n e ’s
cheek and burned there, for she
knew him . She looked past h im
quickly, at his companion. This was
a plum p, white-haired old m an who
walked with a surprisingly alert
step, his hands swinging at his sides.
Uncle J im passed her and interposed
himself between her and these
newcomers; and he said casually:
" H u llo !”
The young man extended hia
hand. “ I ’m Clint Jervies,” he explained.
“ This is Mr. Tope.” He
turned to the girl. “ You're Miss
Leaford, aren't you?”
She nodded slowly, without words.
She was trembling.
Uncle J im asked with narrowing
eyes: "A ll right. What of it?”
And C lint said, in swift, friendly
fashion: “ Why, you see, I happened
to be passing, last night, in
time to give Miss Leaford a lift. And
I wanted to—to make sure she was
a ll right this morning . . . I heard
about your mother,” he added, turning
toward June. " I 'm awfully sorr
y ."
June felt the strength go out of
her. There was a bench built
against the cabin front, and she
sat down as though her knees gave
way.
Uncle J im turned to her with a
quick solicitude. “ Ju ne ! Are you
ill? " he whispered. “ Are you all
rig h t?”
"Q u ite ,” she said, and tried to
smile. “ Let me rest a m inute .”
Her cheeks were drained white;
she seemed to droop forward. He
held her; and Tope said:
“ She's fainting, Mr. Glovere. Put
her head down—"
But the girl recovered, straightened
up again; and Glovere said:
"W a it a minute. I can do better.”
He disappeared, came out with a
flask and tumbler. She choked and
gasped and sputtered, but her color
did return.

Monument Absolves Indians of ‘Guilt’
Once Attributed to Prank of Youth
Grandsons of the first settlers
near Hudson, Mich., have paid, as
best they can, a debt to the Pottawatomie
Indians incurred because
of what apparently was merely a
prank of a Pottawatomie stripling.
For three years, residents at Llckley
Corners have worked on a monument
near thc land once called
Squawfield, last Michigan camping
place of the Pottawatomies. The
m onument recently has been dedicated.
The history has been handed down
from one generation to the next.
More than a century ago, thc accounts
relate, a Pottawatomie boy,
playing with white boys, brandished
his knife around the head of a white
playmate.
The whites were incensed at what
they thought was an attempted
scalping. But Bawbeese, chief of
the tribe, explained that the boy
was merely joking.
Most of the whites apparently took
Bawbeese's explanation at face value;
a few others, covetous of land
held by the Indians, used the incident
as an excuse to have them
moved to a western reservation as
dangerous and not to be trusted.
R. M. Lickley, spokesman for the
group which built the monument to
tha Pottawatomiea and Bawbeeaa.
flrst such honor for the tribe, asserts:
“ We have yet to find a historical
record where Bawbeese or any of
his tribe ever committed an atrocity.
We have thought for some time
that the Pottawatomies should be
publicly exonerated and should have
recognition for their m any kindnesses
to our forefathers."
Lickley’s grandfather was one of
Bawbeese’s white friends in the early
settlement.
The Twelve Caesars
The twelve Caesars were Ju lius
Caesar and the eleven emperors following
him , most of whom were
from his family. Nerva was chosen
by the senate, and was the first to
select a successor without regard to
fam ily . Following are the names
and dates of the reigns of the
twelve: Ju liu s Caesar, 44 B. C . ;
Augustus, 31 B. C. to 14 A. D .; Tiberius,
14-37; Caius, 37-41; Claudius.
41-54; Nero. 54-68; Galba, 68-69;
Otho, 69; Vitellius, 69; Vespasian,
69-79; Titus. 79-81; Domltian, 81-96
The title Caesar was given to all of
the Roman emperori, until the time
of H adrian, after whom Caesar was
th t title of the heir of the throne,
and the titla of tha emperor waa
Augustus.

State Capital Letter
(Run-over from first page.)
Director Ralph E. Ammon of the department,
originally chosen by the
earlier La Follette-chosen board, as
temporary director.
By the terms of the agricultural
department reorganization act, the
board is authorized to hire a director,
while all of the present division heads
of the department may be removed
and replaced if the Republican administration
desires. There was no indication
of policy in that direction, although
Senator William FreehofT of
Waukesha, Republican, chairman of
the legislative committee which has
investigated the department, told the
senate recently that Harry Klueter,
chief of the division of standards of
the farm department, would soon retire
from his job voluntarily.
Capitol Notes
Possibility of a revised code bill for
cities with more than 5,000 population
and counties with more than 30,000
vanished last week as Speaker Thomson,
Richland Center Republican, declared
out of order a substitute bill
which would have set up codes for
barbers, cleaners and dyers, shoe-repairers
and beauty operators.
The proposal to send the University
of Wisconsin band on tour to the New
York W'orld’s Fair and the San Francisco
Exposition as an advertisement
of Wisconsin failed as the senate by
a 23-4 vote opposed a $25,000 appropriation
for the trip.
Cities will be permitted to set up
pension systems for school employes,
such as janitors, clerks and maintenance
workers under a bill concurred in
by the assembly. The bill now goes to
Governor Heil for signature.

The Portrait of a Lady
As I leaped through the last issue
of a current magazine, I came across
the picture of a girl with voluptuous
lips and heavy-lidded, smoldering eyes.
On the opposite page was the title,
“ Portrait of a Lady!”
Being a fond parent, methought it
might be well to know what TODAY
demands of the Daughters of Eve if
they are be classified as LADIES.
Are you interested ?
I quote:
“ SHE L I K E S ............
1. “TO PLEASE the MEN. So her
aim is to look pretty. Her clothes, her
hairdo, her makeup are chosen not to
startle but to charm. She knows,
however, that masculine eyes soon
weary of monotony, so she never permits
herself to settle lazily into a
stereotyped pattern.” [A first rate
suggestion for a beauty who “wantsin”
in a sheik’s harem, but no LADY
tries to sell herself in the mart of
eligible men purely on her “eyeappeal.”
After all. a LADY is interested
in an intelligent man. Every
picture has its price; and, me thinks,
the girl whose prettiness and charm
depend on “clothes, hairdo, and makeup”
(important as they are) has hers.
The bird-of-paradise is beautiful. So
are some snakes, but both are cruel
and snakes are full of venom. There
is much more to being beautiful than
external habiliments.]
2. “ A ROSY COMPLEXION. She
specializes in cleansers...........” [Yea,
verily, cleansers for the skin but no
mention is made of cleansers for the
mind. She cannot be a LA DY and
have a muddy complexion, but she can
be a lady, we presume, and have a
muddy mind. She is merely broadminded
when she reads salacious magazines,
looks at suggestive movies, and
listens to ribald stories! Don’t kid
yourselves, girls. No matter how rosy
your complexion, if your mind is evil,
you have only to speak to betray that
you an- no LADY!]
3. “CLEAR, CA N D ID EYES. She
knows all the tricks that make hers
worth gazing into. She washes them
with eye-lotion, darkens her lashes,
keep* her eyebrows neatly brushed
into line and covers any scantiness in
them with mascara. . .”
[Eyes, we are told, are the windows
o f the soul. When there is no soul,
the windows look pretty blank no matter
how beautiful the frame. I saw a
snake charm a bird once— hold the terrified
w ingH creature with the power
of its eye. I ’ve seen eyes in women
that reminded me of that snake’s.
No matter how skillful the makeup,
no eyes are “worth gazing into” unless
they reflect worthy motives and
ideals.]
4. “ P ERFUM E with CH ARACTER.”
[A skunk has “perfume with character”,
but he isn’t popular. He has a
bad reputation. Concentrate on a
good character. Your reputation is
the public’s opinion of your character.
The perfume you use won’t be important
unless you use too much.]
5. “ A LOW-PITCHED, A P P E A L IN
G VOICE . . . ” [A cat may have
a low-pitched, appealing voice when it
is begging to get in out of the cold,
but one would soon weary of its monotonous
meowing. Unless one’s “lowpitched,
appealing voice can be entertaining,
intelligent, sympathetic, and
humorous in its expression, its music
will shortly cease to charm even the
dumbest man!]
“ D E LIC A C Y IS THE CHARM of
H ER MAKE-UP. Her cheeks are
flushed and her lips deepened with the
pastel tone called SKY-BLUE PINK.
Her powder is rosy.”
[And, may I add, DECENCY, IN T
ELL IG EN C E. and a SENSE of
H UM OR are the qualities which will
give her permanent charm with or
without makeup.]

W’ittenberg Defeats Aniwa
The W'ittenberg Pilots downed Aniwa
Sunday on the local diamond in a
game of ball in which the locals took
the lead and held it throughout the
game.
The game was well played and enjoyed
by the fans. A beautiful peg
by Schoepke in the second inning to
catch Malchowski napping at second.
Vance’s running catch of Meidl’s fly
ball in the fifth, and Gunderson’s allaround
playing at short were highlights
of the game.
Lefty Krull demonstrated that he’s
got the stuff it takes to win and in the
pinches had the Aniwa batters practically
tied in knots.
Next Sunday the Pilots play Birnamwood
on the Birnamwood diamond,
and though the B’s have yet to win
their first game this season, they
should not be taken too lightly, because
Manager Krubsack promises to
have a strong lineup to face the
Pilots.

Kland Bests Kelly
The Badgers, at Eland Sunday,
vanquished the Kellyites by virtue of
all around better play. However,
despite their lowly position in the
league standings Kelly is not a set up
for any of the other teams.
Strong allowed the visitors only 3
hits and struck out 17. Gowell’s brief
tenure on the mound resulted in 3 hits
and 2 runs, in the 8th, Strong being
recalled to finish the game.

The Worst ‘Bad Man’
'T ''H E life of Alexander Harvey,
* one of the worst " b a d m e n" of
the fur trading days of more than a
century ago, was just one murder
after another. That isn’t the kind of
career to glorify, but there is no
denying that if you can get away
with it, there is adventure in it.
His first murder was in 1840 at
Fort McKenzie when he shot a mildmannered
employee after first m a k ing
him kneel down before him. He
reported that a Blackfoot Indian did
the killing and no one had the courage
to contradict him.
Later that year, while traveling to
Fort Union, he quarreled with his
companion and shot h im through the
, head. While at the fort, he was
bitterly hated, especially by a Spaniard,
Isodoro. In the presence of a
ijroup of people including the com mander
of the f>rt, he killed Isodoro
and then challenged those present
to do something about it. None
would dare.
Back at F o rt McKenzie a short
while later, the commander was ordered
away and a friend of Harvey's
was left in charge. The two
of them adm itted □ group of Indians
to the fort and then discharged a
cannon into the crowd as they were
coming in the gate. Three Indians
were killed and three wounded, including
a chief. Harvey killed the
wounded chief with his knife and
scalped him.
Although Harvey was responsible
for many other murders, all of them
brutal, and although he was thoroughly
hated, he was never punished
for a single one of them. But there
were so m any plotting his death that
he had to spend his last years skulking
in the Missouri river bottoms.
Laundering Tip. — Sorting and
stain removal are preliminaries to
the actual washing. The backsaving
way is to sort from hamper
or clothes bin (placed at nonstooping
height) onto a large table.

Colorado’s Mystery Man
I N THE early sixties an intellectu-
* al gentleman with strong bearded
features arrived at Georgetown,
Colo., and im mediately became a
celebrity of the local mountain
country. He called himself Commodore
Stephen Decatur and since
there had been two previous Stephen
Decaturs in American history, both
of whom were commodores, his
identity was looked upon with suspicion.
Georgetown residents soon found
that the commodore seemed to get
a great deal of fun out of living. He
got along well with everyone, especially
the ladies. He was the town’s
greatest booster, an advocate of
good roads and the development of
mines.
He became associate editor of the
Georgetown Miner, local paper, in
1869, and thenceforth increased his
popularity. He was a flowery writer
and a first-rate drinker. At odd
moments, also, he would rattle off
Indian language—that of the Sioux,
Om ah a, Ponca or Pottawatomie. Because
of his ability to speak with
them, he was delegated the task of
settling all disputes with the In dians.
In 1876 he was appointed Colorado’s
commissioner to the P h iladelphia
exposition and he was cock
of the walk there, too. He was so
entertaining that he was followed by
crowds wherever he went.
But he was recognized at the exposition
as Stephen Decatur Bross,
brother of the lieutenant-governor of
Illinois. He had disappeared from
Illinois and deserted his wife and
children. The publicity of his discovery
in Philadelphia ruined his
popularity in Colorado and he had to
retire to obscurity.

ocean.

keep right on going after 30. Ben
O. Howard, who skippers the Douglas
DC-4, the largest land plane in
the world, across the country, left
his right leg behind him, on his
way on and up; as did Alexander
P. de Seversky, a marvelous stunt
flier with a wooden leg. And Wiley
Post was served adequately by one
eye in his breathtaking hazards.
They carry on far beyond the one
score and ten which weighted Max
Baer helplessly against Lou Nova.
Ben Howard was flying his
■elf-made plane in the Bendix
Transcontinental Trophy race in
September, 1936, when he
crashed in New Mexico. He and
his wife, Mrs. Olive Howard,
also a flier, were critically injured.
He was unconscious 36
days and his leg was am p u tated.
“ Research pilot,” which is now
Mr. Howard’s rating with the United
Air lines, appears to be a bit upgrade
from the test pilot job, and
implies engineering and technical
(k ill as well as coolness and courage.
AU this Mr. Howard gained
in designing, building and racing
planes for m any years as the “ ride-

In 1930, he was flying the night

Louis. Losing daytime sleep at
times, he built a slick little 100-
horsepower racer which made
h im the star of the National Air
races at Chicago in 1930. His
small-engined planes kept on
snatching prizes from ships
with twice as much power.
After his accident, he was out
for 15 months, and then back
with United Air lines in experim
ental work.
He is dark, slender, reserved,

sensitive and intuitive fingers of a

He was • very young policeman
and new to the job, but he was also
very keen, and quite determined
that all should be well on his beat.
While patroling the quiet suburban
streets, he noticed a sm art car pull
into the curb and its owner prepare
to alight.
"N ow then, sir, no parking here,”
said the alert young policeman.
“ But, officer, it's a cul-de-sac,”
expostulated the owner of the car.
“ C a n ’t help it if it’s a Rolls-Royce,
you a in ’t allowed to leave it here,”
was the firm retort.
Hat Was O. K.
She was arrayed for the theater.
"Sorry to have kept you waiting so
long,” she said, "b u t it has taken
me longer than usual to get ready.
I look like a fright in this hat, too.”
He was vaguely desirous of saying
something complimentary. “ It isn’t

blundered.
They’ll Get Sunburned
A Missouri farmer was trying to
waken his new hired m an at 4 a. m.
“ What are we going to do today,
Boss?” he yawned.
“ Harvest oats,” the farm er replied.
“ Are they wild?”
"N othing wild about ’em that I
know of. Why do you ask th a t? "
The hired man was puzzled. “ If
they're not wild,” he inquired, “ why
do we have to sneak up on ’em in
the d a rk ? ”

padded head to match her spread.
Ingenuity would have to substitute

considering this and that when the
plumber was called to fix a leaky
pipe.
As a tiny tot Betsy always said,
“ Let me watch,” when workmen
were coming and at 16 she hadn’t
grown up much. The plumber took
a fine saw out of his tool bag and
sawed a pipe in two just as if it
were wood. Right then something
clicked for Betsy. That old iron
bed in the attic! It could be cut
down. It was cut down, as shown
in the sketch.
Tne top of this bed is padded
with cotton basted to muslin.
j Betsy used an old comforter for
padding. Her mind seems to jum p

The original of Rebecca was Rebecca
Grantz, daughter of Michael
Grantz of LangeidortT in upper
Silesia. Born on March 4, 1781, as
a child and young woman she lived
in Philadelphia, where she was
known as “ the good Jewess” and
“ the beautiful Jewess.” Her portrait
was painted by Malbone and
by Sully.
It was Washington Irving who
called her to the attention of Walter
Scott. Miss Grantz had been a
cherished friend of Irving's fiancee.
She died August 27, 1869.
