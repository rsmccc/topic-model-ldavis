WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY. WISCONSIN. THURSDAY. NOVEMBER 2, 1939 NUMBER 51
Heil-Zimmerman Fight
Governor Julius P. Heil and Secretary
of State Fred R. Zimmerman, two
high state officers who reporters and
politicians said have had political differences
since they took office last
January, this week were involved in a
significant controversy, the outcome
of which will have a direct effect on
more than 100,000 persons as recipients
of public funds and hundreds of
thousands of others as taxpayers.
Whatever may have been the nature
of their reported disagreements earlier,
the present dispute is open for all
to see. It involves the interpretation
of the governor’s legislative power in
the exercise of his right to veto. The
umpire in the fight will be the state
supreme court which a few days ago,
on the petition of the state, decided to
take original jurisdiction in the matter.
The fight arose when Governor Heil
after the final adjournment of the
state legislature vetoed certain appropriation
sections of what was regarded
as the administration’s old age pension
bill. Although the bill passed the
legislature easily, contained broad
liberalizations in pension policy, and
appropriated $2,500,000 to make such
liberalizations possible, the legislature,
despite the almost-barren state treasury,
failed to raise new revenue to
meet the appropriation.
Because of the failure of the legislature
to provide the funds with which
to pay the higher pensions contem
plated in the bill, Governor Heil decided
upon the partial veto. The bill
as it remained after it left his hands
and was sent to Zimmerman as secre
tary of state, contained, as principal
features, only the technical permission
to increase pensions from $30 to $40
and a requirement that county pen
sion personnel be selected on a merit
basis.
Zimmerman Protects
Mr. Zimmerman, whose long previous
political career includes two
earlier terms as secretary of state,
and two years as governor, has in
recent years frequently endorsed the
claims of the organized old age
pension advocates. Two weeks ago
when pension spokesmen announced
the formation of a new “liberal Republican
party” , he volunteered to pay
the $5 fee which is required for legal
incorporation of the organization.
When Heil sent Zimmerman the
partially vetoed old age pension bill
to be published in the official state
newspaper, a preliminary to the effectiveness
of a new statute, Zimmerman
refused to comply, asserting his
belief that an appropriation measure
partly disapproved by the governor
after legislative adjournment is unconstitutional.
I t was pointed out that
the power of partial veto during a
session is undisputed. The secretary
of state invited the governor to start
a mandamus action to compel him to
publish the measure. This Governor
Heil promptly did, with the result
that the matter was before the court
last week. The case will be argued
November 10, the court announced.
Important Decision
The opinion of the state high court
will be a significant one, for a number
of far-reaching reasons:
1. Lawyers assert that the precedent
thus established is one for which
there has been a long felt need
2. On the decision hangs the question
of increasing the benefits of Wisconsin’s
47,000 old age pension beneficiaries
and participation in the increased
federal aids which are available
only on a matching basis.
3. On the decision also hangs the
validity of the governor's veto of the
$5,000,000 relief bill which orginally
provided that localities would be reimbursed
for a tenth of their relief costs
by the state.
4. The possibility of a special session
of the legislature will largely be
determined by the court’s action
Should the governor be sustained, and
the appropriations invalidated, a
special session to raise new taxes may
be avoided, capitol officials and observers
believe. Should he lose, and
should the pension appropriation become
law, the state would either defa
u lt on many of its obligations, including
pension payments, or the Heil
administration would find no alternative
to a special tax-raising session of
the legislature.
Highway Investigation
While a large part of the capitol
and the public watched with interest
the developments in thc legal fight,
over the pension appropriation, an;
almost equal degree of interest was
bureau of research in its investigation
of the affairs of the state highway
commission.
The bureau of research was authorized
by the 1939 legislature about six
months ago at the personal request of
Governor Julius P. Heil, the businessman,
who explained that he wanted an
agency which would help him to institute
means of improving the business
management of state capitol departments,
and thus lead the way to operating
economies. He put in charge of
the brand new agency, which got an
elastic appropriation from the lawmakers,
August Frey, former Milwaukee
industrial purchasing agent,
and one of the governor’s oldest
friends.
The highway commission is one of
the big state departments which
Governor Heil and the Republican administration
tried unsuccessfully to
reorganize during the last year. Two
separate bills designed to abolish the
present commission, and to replace it
with a single director to be appointed
by and responsible to the governor,
were introduced. The first was decisively
killed in the senate. The
second was allowed to die without a
vote in the assembly.

By a vote of 77 to 16, the electors
of the local school district in Wednesday’s
election signified approval of
the proposition to bond the district
for the purpose of liquidating debts
contracted in the construction of the
gym and new school rooms addition
and the agricultural building.
The authorized bond issue of $15,000
will be taken by the Citizens State
Bank at the interest rate of 3 Vi per
cent. Some over $12,000.00 of the indebtedness
is now bearing interest at
6 per cent. The action of the electors
on Wednesday will therefore mean
quite an annual saving in the matter
of interest.
The Enterprise on October 12 contained
a complete report of the expenditures
made in the recently completed
high school improvements.

Thus the highway commission,
which has a greater power and influence
and has command of a greater
amount of public mboney than any
other single state department, continues
to be under the control of men
who were appointed by Heil’i predecessors
in the governor's office. Its
chairman is William E. O’Brien, who
was appointed in 1933 by Governor
Schmedeman and reappointed this
year by Governor Heil in what was
generally regarded as a concession to
the Democrats in the legislative Coalition.
Other members are Thomas
Pattison of Durand, appointed by
Governor I^a Follette in the latter’s
first term in 1931, and subsequently
reappointed by La Follette, and
Thomas Davlin of Berlin, who was
also twice appointed by I,a Follette
and is a prominent Progressive.
First hearings in the investigation
were conducted by Elmer Barlow of
Arcadia, during the legislative session
legal counsel to Governor Heil and recently
named tax commissioner by the
governor. Barlow conducted the questioning,
with Frey presiding, most in
silence.
Questioning resolved around the
department’s financial policies, the expenditure
of its $32,00(1.000 annua)
revenues from the gasoline tax and
motor vehicle license fees in addition
to other millions in federal highway
aids, and particularly the department’s
experience in cement purchases
for state highway construction jobs in
1938.
Testimony showed that the commission
in 1938 for the first time in several
years, decided to purchase 100,000
barrels of cement, but that the policy
was discontinued in 1930.
Barlow maintained that private purchasers
during the sam*' period were
able to buy cement from the same
companies which submitted bids to the
state from 10 cents to 65 cents a bar
rel cheaper than the amounts paid for
the same product as purchased by the
state. Questioning brought the statement
from commission members that
they had heard of cement price wars
after the state purajiases were made,
but that the reports were so intangible
that no investigation was attempted.
O’Brien, the commission chairman,
offered the opinion that the state’s
purchase from certain companies angered
some companies who did not
place state orders to the extent that
they began price cuts.
Much attention was given to commission
statements, and other evidence,
that state officials knew before
they called for bids that bidding would
be uniform, and that therefore competition
would not be possible as a
basis for awards. It was shown that
contracts were awarded at the discretion
of the commission. Moreover,
the state director of purchases. F. X.
Ritger, told Frey that in his experience
private purchasers have generally
been able to obtain more favorable!
terms than the state and other public i
units on similar materials and com-1
modities.
SCHOOL NEWS
Carnival a Success
The school carnival held last Friday
night from all reports was a success
in every way. The gross receipts were
$122.00 and after expenses are deducted
about $100.00 will be credited
to the school activity fund. This
amount is about $10.00 more than was
netted from the 1937 carnival.
The people of Wittenberg were very
generous in their support of the Carnival.
It is a pleasure to sponsor such
an event when people respond so well.
The committee in charge wishes to
express particular appreciation to the
Wittenberg Enterprise for space
allotted in its news columns, Charles
Huebner and Ronald Hempel for all
their work, merchants for their donation
of merchandise and every one else
that contributed financially and otherwise
to make the affair complete.

Net result: Hitler’s position was uncomfortable.
Europe in Brief:
Turkey’s pact with Britain and
France to m aintain the Mediterranean
status quo established Turkey
as the key balance-of-power nation
in Europe’s struggle for power. Italy,
unperturbed, viewed the pact as a
bar to Russian expansion in the Balkans,
where Mussolini hopes to develop
Italian influence. As a gesture
of renewed confidence, Italian-
French trade restrictions were removed.
Russia and Germany both howled
over the diplomatic defeat, but Hitler
could expect little assistance
from Italy by way of re-establishing
Nazi influence in the Balkans.
Vowing a “ fight to the finish” on
France and Britain, Hitler appealed
stunned by Turkey’s move, warily
sidestepped m ilitary assistance to
the Reich because all Europe
seemed conspiring against G erm any.
Soviet demands on Finland
were reportedly eased.
Fighting on the western front continued
lazily, Hitler ordering his
troops to remain on their own side
of the French border. Observers
thought this was a peace gesture,
but he meanwhile summoned party
leaders to sound out German sentiment
on a m ajo r offensive. At sea
and over England, German planes
remained active.
Net result for the week: Anti-
H itler forces gained considerable
strength. Russia, having won all
she wanted from Germany and being
unwilling to play ball with a
to Russia for aid. The Soviet, loser, watched from the sidelines.

the most prolific oratorical

unabated. Congressmen, senators.
bystanders and men with axes

why the arms embargo should

Col. Charles A. Lindbergh thought
we might soon have to forbid any
American nation from sending
troops abroad or giving bases to
foreign battleships. Michigan’s Sen.
Prentiss Brown took him to task for

of nationalistic imperialism.

as usual, blamed Germany.)
While Repealists Key Pittmnn and
Alben Barkley fought to lim it debate
and bring the neutrality issue to a
vote, U. S. public opinion was undeniably
waxing wary. Repealists
had already made some concessions,
abandoning the 90-day credit
clause and proposed restrictions on
U. S. shipping. Whereas 44 per
cent of the nation (in a Gallup) poll
had earlier favored U. S. participation
in the war should the allies lose,
the percentage now dropped to 29.
Observers thought the measure
would get senate approval, but there
were indications it had a majority
of only 15 votes in the house.
M A R I N E :
Opportunity?
At Washington the U. S. maritim
e commission learned its 5.000-
ton freighter City of Flint had been
seized by Germany for carrying contraband
of war to Britain. Reports
said the boat was taken flrst to
Tromsoe, Norway, where a Nazi
prize crew manned her. Two days
later the Soviet news agency announced
the boat was at Kol bay,
north of Murmansk. This startling
incident, first U. S. involvement in
t h t war of 1939, fascinated Princeton’s
Dr. Edward S. Corwin, professor
of jurisprudence. He figured
it this way: The U. S. can now ask
Russia to state her position as regards
the warring nation. If Russia
m aintains she is neutral, the
U. S. can demand return of the interned
ship; if Russia indicates she
is a belligerent, then Britain and
France can go to work on Soviet
shipping. In any case, Dr. Corwin
thought it would clarify Russia’s position
with Germany.

Forgotten under the stress of war
has been Am erica’s mounting public
debt, which supplied a No. 1 political
argument before anti-administration
forces turned their attention
to neutrality (See CONGRESS).
j But one fine October day Secretary
of the Treasury Morgenthau called
reporters for a story that set the opposition
campaigning again. The
story: The treasury was borrowing
$150,000,000 in 91-day discount notes,
although slightly less than $100,000,-
000 in s im ilar obligations were due.
Thus the public debt was hiked $58,-
000,000 in one day, the extra borrowing
being a precaution against
financing at a time when war news
might make it difficult.
Thus the total debt reached $40,-
963,392,881 and seemed a cinch to
cross the $41,000,000,000 m ark within
the week. Figures on public debt
growth were discouraging: It was
about 2H billions greater than a
year ago, and a deficit of $1,291,-
509,406 had piled up since the cur-

Browder testified he had traveled

hence it became a political
issue. Through the national Republican
office, New Jersey's Rep. J.
Parnell Thomas (a Dies prober),
charged Democratic Attorney General
F rank Murphy with being
“ strangely indifferent and listless.”
Upshot was Frank Murphy’s announcement
that a secret investigation
had been under way for some

secret indictments. Next day, as if
a long-forgotten m atter were suddenly

Browder was indicted. The question:

WASHINGTON.—What’s become
of that 300-mile neutral zone around
the Americas? There are several answers,
but Latin-American diplomats
do not find them amusing.
Cynically minded observers insist
that the whole thing was a beautiful
plan to aid Britain and France, un-
Oer the guise of keeping the war
away from the Western hemisphere.
The 116 reconditioned World war destroyers
were to patrol this zone,
with assistance from other naval
vessels, and at once protect inter-
American shipping and prevent the
war zone from spreading to this side
of the Atlantic. It was to be an
answer to G e rm a ny’s reported longrange
submarines, to her mysterious
tankers which could supply undersea
boats in the South Atlo^ ic
or Pacific, and an assurance t iat
at least part of the long trail over
which supplies from the Americas
to B ritain and France would have to
pass would be safe.
But apparently the notion was
born without benefit of British and
French consultation.
They paid no attention
to it, apparently,
u ntil the Latins,
reluctantly d ragooned
into session
away in advance of
the date they thought
necessary, formally
adopted the neutrality-
zone idea on the
urgent pleas of Sumner
Welles, under
secretary of state.
Then, and not till
then, they spoke. They d id n ’t like
it. How could the thing be adjusted
to perm it free m ilitary access by
the Allies to their own possessions in
the Americas. Particularly to J a maica,
British and French Guiana,
British Honduras, Martinique, etc.?
T h is C o u n t r y Is N e u t r a l
A n d W o u l d S ta y T h a t W a y
Well, it Seemed like a good idea
at the time, but after all this country
is neutral. The other members
of the Pan American Union are all
neutral, and certainly we don’t want
to do anything to get ourselves em broiled:
O f course the cynics in the
L atin diplomatic corps have more to
say, unofficially. They wonder why
it was that this was a good idea so
long as it seemed aimed only at
Germany, but has virtually been forgotten
since Britain and France expressed
doubts as to its workability.
If you will dig back into the debates
on the Versailles treaty in the
United States senate, and particularly
the discussions of the League
of Nations covenant, it m ay throw
some interesting light on what is
going on in Washington now. Especially
if you remember that F ran klin
D. Roosevelt, as a candidate for
vice president in 1920, approved the
policy of Woodrow Wilson wholeheartedly.
Wilson had said that Article X , of
the league covenant, was the
“ heart” of the covenant. This is
the article which provided that the
members of the League of Nations
should use force to prevent aggressions
by one nation on another. This
article has never been observed,
even by the nations which did join
the league. It was fiever even seriously
proposed in the league assembly
at Geneva, though there
were two notable occasions when
member nations were attacked, notably
China and Ethiopia.

Despite all the war-boom talk
there is a tremendous under-thesurface
movement in Washington for
a big new lending and spending bill.
A considerable group of New Dealers
is pushing it quietly, but determinedly.
Apparently they are not
discouraged by the bad beating the
lend-spend idea took in the last session
of congress, when that $3,000,-
000.000 program for public works,
express highways, rural electrification
and whatnot was thrown in the
ashpile by a combination of conservative
Democrats and Republicans.
Industry, the New Dealers are
saying, is still lagging because not
enough of the nation’s savings go
into investment to lift its purchasing
power ond keep production equipment
in full operation.
The war boom, say the New Dealers,
is just a palliative. Advocates
of the lend-spend theory insist that
if private industry can’t absorb all
our savings, the government must
take a hand—must divert savings
into productive investment by measures
more far-reaching than any
which have been taken to date. A
few of the more cautious fear that
if the government starts speeding
up and manipulating the flow of investment
funds, private capital may
get another case of jitters and loy
down absolutely. These fraid cats
say that it would scarcely be possible
for the government to take up
the slack if it threw that sor» cf
paralyzing scare into private capitalists.
But there have always been a few
cautious folks hanging round the
borders of the New Deal, and it is
not of record that they managed to
do much besides utter gloomy forebodings.
Usually the left wingers
have won out before the battle became
too gory. And generally there
were a few political casualties on
the tim id side. “ Not reprisals,"
you understand, " ju s t increased efficiency
through personnel changes."
S p e n d - L e n d E n th u s ia s t s A r e
P e r f e c t ly S in c e re T h e o ris ts
So far there is no concrete plan.
As a m atter of fact most of the
spend-lend enthusiasts are perfectly
sincere theorists—they are not try*
ing to win adoption of their plan
because they want to include some
pet projects. This makes them all
the more effective because they can
always win a lot of strength by
parceling out fat projects, thus winning
support for the whole scheme
from people who have no sympathy
whatever with the m a in idea.
However, one of the notions being
advocated by influential members
of the spend-lend group proposes the
setting up of a new government departm
ent for the purpose of investing
in industry. At the beginning,
the idea would be to confine this
investment of government funds to
the railroads and utilities. Drastic
rules governing this investment
would be written into the law.
One of these, which is arousing
considerable interest, is that there
m ust be a complete reorganization
of the privately owned railroad or
electric company accepting government
funds. New stock, based on a
valuation of the property, would be
issued for all outstanding securities.
More stock would be issued to cover
new expenditures, the government
taking all the investment bankers
do not sell to the public.
E u r o p e a n W a r s E ffe c t o n
P r e s id e n t ia l A s p ir a tio n s
The late Jo h n J. Mahon, for many
years Democratic organization boss
o t Baltimore, used to observe that
“ 24 hours is a lifetime in politics."
Numerous presidential aspirants are
learning that there is a whole lot of
truth in that statement.
Last spring, for instance, Thomas
E . Dewey was fa r and away ahead
of a ll other Republican aspirants, if
one believes the polls. But H itler’s
invasion of Poland changed that far
more effectively th ro the Frank
Murphy “ overshadowing” operations
so elaborately planned by the
administration.
Now consider the im mediate beneficiary,
Sen. Arthur H. Vandenberg.
The Michigan senator
has virtually
staked his chances
on a set of time elements
over none of
w'hich he has the
slightest control. He
has become the leader
of the “ peace
bloc,” the spearhead
of the fight to prevent
repeal of the
arm s embargo.
But suppose, as
m an y people still believe
w'ill happen, that eventually
the United States gets into the war,
on the side of B ritain and France.
Is it not possible that the reaction
will be decidedly unfavorable to
Vandenberg for some tim e thereafter?
Is it not even possible that
m any will think, had no such fight
been made as Vandenberg is m a k ing,
that Hitler m ight have seen the
h andwriting on the wall and thus
m ade unnecessary the sending of
American boys to France?
Far-fetched? Yes, but no more
strange than m any political reactions
which followed the last World
war.
P ro - E m b a rg o S e n a to rs B ase
H o p e o n A c t io n o f H o u s e
Then again, suppose Vandenberg
wins his fight. It is not likely that
he could win in the senate. It seems
inevitable, as this is written, that
when the roll call is reached a substantial
m ajo rity of the senate will
vote to repeal the embargo against
shipping “ arms, am m unition and
implements of w ar” to belligerents.
But there are wild rumors of what
the house m ight do. In fact proembargo
senators, from Vandenberg
down, privately a dm it their
real hope is that the public opinion
they are expecting to arouse by
their speeches in the senate will
have its real effect on the house.
So suppose Vandenberg wins, in
the house, and then that next spring
and sum m er the war seems to be
going very badly for B ritain and
France. What will be the public
reaction? Is it not hum an to expect
that those of the American voters
who sympathize with B ritain and
France, little as they m ay want
their husbands and sons and brothers
to get in the firing line, will
hold resentment against the men
who deprived Britain and France of
an arm s supply?
But there are other tim e elements.
From the very first day of the war
everyone expected Hitler to launch
fearful air attacks on France and
Britain, especially Britain. For reasons
which the international experts
have explained at length, he has delayed.
But every day he has delayed
has been of advantage to Britain
and France so far as getting
ready is concerned. It has increased
their inadequate supply of guns and
am m unitio n; it has permitted their
arms factories and explosives works
to run 24 hours a day.

He warned the world many

else matters—not even money
and fame.
The late R alph Blakelock lost his

critical or popular interest in his
work. He was hailed as a great
painter, and his pictures were
bought by great galleries when he
no longer knew or cared about money
or recognition. There is an interesting
parallel between his career
and that of Mr. Eilshemius, although
the latter is still bright and sm art

But be won't even look out of

wants no outlook on a world
turning itself into a madhouse.
Pictures on the Boor, covered

worth a fortune, pictures of
moods, dreams and memories,
but that doesn't interest him .
He had renounced the “ pomps
and vanities of this wicked

sical composi- j
tion. Eilshemius has composed a j
sm all library of songs, operas and
etudes and used to give piano concerts
in his youth. He painted fe- j
verishly for 46 years, quitting in 1922
when none would buy his pictures
and ,no galleries hang them. But,
in his varied abilities, he far outshone
Blakelock. Here are a few
of his achievements:
When he was a student at Cornell
university, he discovered a new species
of ichneumon fly. Later he announced
a new law governing the
"ram ification of trees.”
He wrote somewhat more than 50
volumes of plays, novels, novelettes,
essays and verse. The verse, Byronic
in tone, was written in English,
French, Germ an, Ita lia n and
Spanish. He published them h im self
and, like his pictures, they gathered
only cobwebs and dust.
He invented a new kind of "m a g ic
" indelible ink and several studio j
devices for artists.
He explored various diseases and
offered methods of therapy.
He was born in Laurel H ill, N. J .,
near Newark, the son of a wealthy
glove manufacturer. He attended
Cornell two years and was a roommate
of Robert W. Chambers in
Paris when they were studying art
under Bougereau.
His is a blue-book fam ily of
Dutch antecedents, and his name
is there inscribed, but that interests
him no more than the hanging
of his pictures in the Metropolitan,
the Luxembourg and the
Whitney galleries.

“ Rundhia, you are talking dangerously,”
said the Resident.
“ Yes. Whose danger? It would
smell sweet, wouldn’t it! I was riding
early this morning. I saw Norwood
on his way to the river—overheard
him say that priests were
waiting for him near the river. And
I happen to know he was down by
the river after midnight last night.
Now he carries diamonds in his
tunic pocket.”
“ Have you seen them ?”
“ No.”
“ Who d id ?”
“ I am well informed about it.”
“ Look here, Rundhia. You don’t
expect me, do you, to credit an unsupported
charge, based on hearsay,
against an officer who has a
perfectly clean record?”
“ Would you prefer that I take my
information elsewhere?”
“ Who was your info rm ant?"
“ I refuse to tell you.”
The Resident rose from his chair:
“ I hope the drive home won’t affect
you disagreeably!”
Rundhia actually started for the
door. As he drew abreast, the Resident
said:
“ Hello, I notice your nose is bleeding.
Have you been in an accident?”
“ Ask Norwood!”
“ You mean to tell me—? Do you
know where Norwood is now?”
“ At the palace, in conference, perhaps
fishing for a larger bribe from
someone else.”
“ Now, now, Rundhia! Who was
your informant about those diam
onds?”
“ I might tell you in strict confidence.”
“ I promise nothing. But I will
believe nothing unless you tell me
your informant’s nam e.”
“ Between you and me, it was
Miss Lynn H arding.”
“ How should she know?”
“ She saw them. Norwood is in
love with her.”
“ You know tha t?”
"A ny fool could guess it. I think
Norwood casually let her see them
to impress her. He is m ad about
her. Don’t quote me. I t ’s up to you
now.”
C H A PT ER IX
The Maharanee’s m aid, who
changed Lynn’s frock, was one of
those who had been loaned to Aunty
Harding, because she knew English.
I t was impossible not to believe that
the Maharanee already knew more
than the facts about Lynn’s break
with her aunt. The maid left the
bedroom. The Maharanee sat by
the veranda window, staring past
the edge of the sun-blind into the
garden. There was hardly a sound
except the purring of the two electric
fans.
Meanwhile, she smoked a cigarette
and watched the Maharanee,
who seemed to Lynn to be considering,
not what to say, but how to say
what was crowding her thought.
“ Maharanee dear, I wish you
wouldn’t feel so upset.”
“ How you must despise us.”
“ Please! I don’t. To go away
leaving you thinking anything as untrue
as that would be dreadful. I
am not even angry with R u ndhia.”
“ I am more than angry with
h im ,” said the Maharanee. “ I am
ashamed. Lynn, is it true—-it has
been told to me—that Mrs. Harding
saw Rundhia kiss you in the gard
e n?”
“ Yes. That, too, was my fault.
* 1 could have prevented it. I knew
Aunty was looking. I did it to annoy
her.’’
“ Not because you like R u nd h ia ?”
“Oh, I like him. He is the handsomest
thing 1 have ever seen, and
amusing. 1 was playing with fire,
I knew that.”
The Maharanee’s worried face relaxed
into a wise smile: “ My dear,
you don’t know Rundhia if you think
he won’t try it again! Unless—is it
true—it has been told to me—that
Mrs. Harding has decided not to
•ta y here any longer?”
“ First train, and first steamer for
home,” Lynn answered. “ Marching
orders. At the moment, it hurts
her to move and she can’t keep
food down. But th t doctor can probably
fix that. And she’s brave. She
has an iron will. She told me to
pack m y things.”
“ And will you do it? ”
“ What in the world else can I
do? I haven’t a sous marquis to
my name. Aunty gives me pocket
money—no more.”
The Maharanee smiled: “ Yes.
Lack of money can make even R u ndhia
obey. But it is a limited power.
It can be broken.”
“ So I think. But it remains to be
seen,” Lynn answered.
“ You are of age? You don’t look
it, but you are, are you not? If I
invite you to remain in the palace
as m y guest, will you accept?”
“ How can I ? ”
“ It would give me very great
pleasure to provide you with more
than pocket money. I can easily invent
a salaried position. You have
been such a comfort, such a joy to
me, that your companionship would
more than justify a requisition on
'Well, perhaps I was mistaken.'*
His Highness my husband’s exchequer.
Is it true— it has been told to
me—that Mrs. Harding threatened
to—m y informant did not clearly understand—
I think the word was disinherit?”
“ Aunty has threatened that several
times. Today I took her at her
W’ord,” Lynn answered. “ She will
pay my fare home. After that, I
go on my own way—earn a living. It
was final.”
“ Can you legally be left without
m oney?”
“ I suppose so.”
“ You say you will earn a living.
How? What can you do?”
“ I don’t know yet.”
“ For such a beautiful girl as you
are there is always marriage to look
forward to. Is Mrs. Harding not
afraid of what people may say if
she should leave you penniless until
you m a rry ?”
“ She isn’t afraid of people. Other
people are afraid of her. She
will simply say I was impossible.
But I won’t accept another cent
from her. Maharanee dear, you
can’t guess. Perhaps I'm as ungrateful
and bad as she says. But
I know what I have had to endure.
No more humiliation from Aunty
H arding! I am through.”
“ Lynn darling, say nothing until
you have thought. You haven't had
time to think. And you are naturally
prejudiced at the moment, even
though you are so magnanimous and
don’t admit it. A greater magnanim
ity than yours I have seldom
heard of. Lynn, the offer of a throne
is not contemptible. Shall I write a
note to Mrs. Harding saying you
have accepted my invitation to stay
with us?”
“ Better let me tell her that,” said
Lynn. “ Aunty would blow up. She
isn’t one bit pleasant when she’s
angry. Say you’ve invited me. How
would that be?”
ted artfully evasive perjury. Norwood
sat at the foot of the long table,
looked, listened, and made endless
notes.
They weren’t half through by
lunch-time. They gave him tiffin in
the palace, all by himself, in a silent
room, where a clock ticked as
loud as fork against plate and he
caught himself eating in time to the
hypnotic beat, thinking of diamonds.
Curried mutton and rice. Whiskey
and soda. Sweet cakes. Fruit. Coffee.
A cigar. And then back to the
Council room to listen to more arguments
that were interrupted by the
arrival of Rundhia’s Bengali physician,
shepherding a servant who
carried a big blue goblet on a plate.
The M aharajah swallowed his tonic
and immediately became less
nervous. Then he asked, in E nglish,
presumably for Norwood’s benefit:
“ How is Mrs. H arding?”
Norwood cared less than nothing
about Mrs. H arding's feelings at the
moment, but he couldn’t help hearing
the doctor’s answer:
“ She is not well. But I cannot
persuade her to take medicine. She
is petulant—very.”
The M aharajah tried to seem incredulous
of any lady’s petulance:
“ Convey my solicitude.”
Norwood managed to escape from
the conference soon after that. He
was aw’ay on the horse before the
sais woke up. He cantered to the
Residency, where he had to wait in
the office an exasperating fifteen
minutes, until the Resident could be
awakened from his afternoon snooze
and could get tubbed and come
downstairs.
“ May I see you alone, sir?”
The Resident nodded. He didn't
appear to enjoy the prospect. They
went into the darkened library, and
Norwood sat in the same chair that
Rundhia had occupied. He laid the
black paper package of diamonds on
the table:
“ Take a look at those, sir. I
want to turn them over to you. I
would like to get a receipt, and to
make a statement in writing.”
The Resident opened the envelope
and poured the diamonds into his
hand. He made a wry face and
poured them back again:
“ Nine?”
“ I haven’t counted them.”
“ They look valuable. WTiere did
you get them ?”
“ I am not absolutely certain. I
think they must have been slipped
into my pocket, early this morning,
by one of the unofficial representatives
of the temple authorities, who
met me by appointment, near the
w aterfall.”
“ What were you doing?”
“ Inviting myself for a visit of inspection
of the mine. They met me
to discuss it.”
“ And you say they dropped these
in your pocket?”
“ I believe so. I t ’s a pretty obvious
attempt to bribe me to write
a report in their favor.”
“ But they said nothing? Not even
a h int?”
“ One of them, I remember, did
say he hoped m y judgment wouldn’t
be affected by worthless arguments.
He rather dwelt on the word worthless,
but it made no special impression
on me at the tim e .”
“ Very well, Captain Norwood, I
will take your statement.” The Resident
glanced at his watch. “ You’re
rather late with it. There seems to
me to be needed some explanation
when you called this morning.”
“ I didn’t know, at that time, that
I had them in my pocket.”
The Resident’s face was expressionless.
“ You had better be sure
to include that in your statement.
I t ’s credible, of course, in view of
your record. But people might draw
inferences. Don’t you think so?”
“ You suggest, sir?”
“ Nothing. 1 am offering advice.
It might be inferred that you accepted
these diamonds and said
nothing aboi|t them until you
learned, let us say at the palace,
that someone knew about it; and
that then you hurried to me in •
rather belated attempt to establish
innocence. I am simply pointing out
to you what might be inferred if
you are not particularly careful.”
Norwood stared at the package of
diamonds. He thought a minute.
Then he looked straight in the Resident’s
eyes and spoke quite calmly:
“ You appear to me to be hinting.
Had you heard about these before I
brought them to you?”
“ Yes.”
“ Who was your informant?”
“ It was confidential.”
“ You suspect me of having accepted
a bribe?”
“ I reserve my opinion.”
“ Very well, sir, you adm it that
someone accused me. I want the
name of the informant. Otherwise
I demand my a n est and a court
m a r tia l.”
“ Keep your temper. You have already
been reported to me for punching
someone’s nose.”
“ Whose?”
“ My inform ant’s nose was bleeding.”
“ Very well, who was he? I have
punched no one’s nose. Someone
has been lying to you about me.
Surely I have the right to know who
he is.”
“ Captain Norwood, on your word
of honor, are you telling the truth ?”
“ Yes.”
“ Well, perhaps I was mistaken.
Perhaps I inferred it. I forget the
exact words. Prince Rundhia certainly
intended me to understand
that you had made his nose bleed.”
“ Oh. So it was Rundhia. I wonder
how the devil Rundhia knew I
had those diamonds.”
“ Well, did you call on Miss Harding
this m o rning ?’’
Norwood stared. He looked almost
as if he had been punched in
the jaw.
“ Yes,” he said, after a moment.
“ I called on Mrs. Harding to take
her a bottle of fresh iodine. Miss
Harding saw the diamonds when
they fell from my pocket.”
“ Is it true that you have been
paying her a lot of attention?”
“ No.”
“ You have not had words with
Rundhia about her?”
“ Yes. I did tell Rundhia, last
night after midnight, that if anything
should happen to Lynn Harding, I
would hold him answ’erable.”
“ Why should you have said that?”
“ Because I like her. I suspected
Rundhia’s intentions.”
“ Are you sure she is nice? Why
should she have told Rundhia?”
“ I don’t believe she did. Rundhia
lied, if you ask me. Perhaps a servant
told h im .”
“ Just a moment, sir. This occurs
to me. Is Rundhia exactly in
good standing? ”
“ No. Confidentially, speaking off
the record, I took a recent occasion
to warn him that one more indiscretion
might endanger his succession
to the throne."
“ I suppose,” said Norwood, “ it
would be a great deal easier, and
would cause a lot less trouble, to
veto him now than to have to depose
him later on, after he had
come to the throne?”
“ Why, yes, certainly. Even the
right of veto isn’t anything we like
to exercise. To depose a ruling
prince, after once having recognized
his right to the throne—well, it has
been done. But it isn’t good policy,
if it can be avoided. You see, the
alternative to Rundhia is Jodha, who
is an invalid and likely to be childless.
We might be accused of deposing
Rundhia in order to grab
Kadur. No. If Rundhia should succeed
to the throne, his position
would be fairly secure.”

The “ biggest rain” that might fall
on a river or creek watershed is one
of the things that engineers need to
know in building a dam for flood
control. This hypothetical rain
must be at m ax im um intensity and
duration. The run-off from such a
rain determines the size of the
dam and—more especially—the size
of the spillway. Huge losses may
be avoided if the dam and spillway
are big enough to withstand any
flood that may develop. Huge savings
result when construction does
not exceed needs for which the dam
is built.
Rainfall records and hydrometeorological
specialists of the United
States weather bureau provide the
corps of engineers, United Stsftes
army, with essential information on
possible m ax im um precipitation
in a number of watersheds or basins
where flood-control projects are under
way. The figures turned over
to the engineers by the river and
flood division of the weather bureau,
represent the m ax im um in rain
intensity and duration that may be
expected. The biggest ram that
may be expected would equal any
big rains that have fallen, or might
i fall, on the river basin in question.
The Arkansas river basin above
Caddoa, Colo., where a dam is to
be built, is a good example. In
checking its records, the weather bureau
considered all big rains in that
part of the United States and determined
whether or not they might
have fallen on the upper Arkansas
watershed. The probability of a bigger
rain than the hypothetical rain
is a virtual impossibility, says the |
weather bureau.
The weather bureau has figures
on the m axim um rainfall for other
such watersheds. Among them, the
Arkansas river basin above Caddoa, 1
Colo., the St Francis river above
Wapapello, Mo., the White river
above the Mud Mountain damsite
in Washington, Wolf creek above
Fort Supply in Oklahoma, and Mill
creek in Cincinnati. It is planned
to make a similar study of all prin- i
cipal river basins in the country.
Something to Reflect On
It takes more than ^.O OO ^’orkers
to make the plate glass mirrors sold !
in this country every year. This big

wages, buys $41,000,000 worth of raw
m aterial and sells mirrors valued
at $80,000,000. I
What a feeling, of satisfaction it
creates to be able to confront the
fam ily with an attractive and substantial
meal, even after a long afternoon
of shopping or of bridge. It
takes a bit of planning to accomplish
that!
A selection of “ Hurry-Up-Menus,”
planned to economize on time, without
sacrificing quality, is the answer
to that problem. Choose foods
which can be prepared for cooking
several hours in advance. A
casserole dish requiring little
cooking is a wise selection for the
m ain dish of your meal; or, if you
like, plan a broiler dinner or “ grill”
which can be cooked in little more
time than it takes to set the table.
Appetite teasing meals, and meals
that can be put together in only a
few minutes’ time, can be built
around these popular and satisfying
m am dishes. In most instances
all that’s required to complete them
is bread, a beverage, and a sim ple
fresh fruit dessert.

What is the first thought that
comes to your mind when you
think of “ entertaining” ? Hard
work? Expense? Formality? It
should mean none of these!
Rather, that word “ entertaining”
stands for friendliness, and
warmth, and sociability. Eleanor
Howe will tell you next week how
to make entertaining easy. Be
sure to look for the article, “ Let’s
All Have Tea.”

It is saying, “ No, I don’t want it.”

tightly closed lips and a shake of
the head mean an emphatic “no.”

TODAY ONLY: $5
M ANY times, on a wager, men
have tried to sell $5 bills to
strangers for as little as $1.98—legitimate
$5 bills worth $5 anywhere.
They have usually failed.
The reason is simple to see: Lack
of confidence.
Their proposition sounded too
good to be true, failed to arouse the
confidence of the prospects, who
were afraid to buy.
No one trusted the seller because
no one knew h im . He m igh t be a
counterfeiter. Who
knows? He might
have some trick up
his sleeve. Who
knows? Better have
nothing at all to do
with him.
Confidence is the
mainspring of business.
Without it no
business can succeed
and no product can
be sold, because before
any one of us is
willing to part with
a penny, we m ust have confidence |
that that which we are going to buy j
will give us value received.
Confidence is not a matter which j
can be bought. It must be earned. I
It is a process of growth. The idea |
of confidence grows from one customer
to the next one. It gives vi- !
tality to everything about a busi- ;
ness.
When confidence enters into a
Charles Roth
BILLS FOR $1.98
business transaction, everything
about it becomes pleasant. But
whenever confidence is absent, no
amount of any other qualities can
take its place.
You have often bought something
from someone you did not know, say
a solicitor who succeeded in taking
away your money at the door. Will
you ever see him again? Will you
get the goods you have paid for?
Was it a miniature swindle? You
wonder and worry.
You spend hours in painful doubt.
Perhaps everything turned out all
right. Even so, the protit went out
of the transaction when you had to
worry about getting your money s
worth. Buy goods that are advertised
from merchants who advertise.
There lies confidence.
One of the chief services of newspaper
advertising to consumers is
that it denotes which merchants or
products are worthy of confidence.
Because newspaper publishers are
so jealous of their advertising colunts
and are quick to reject anything
which does not live up to their
standards, readers know that if a
thing is regularly advertised in the
newspaper it is worthy of their confidence.
As a matter of fact, the appearance
of an advertisement in a newspaper
is recommendation nf the
character and quality of thc goods
being advertised.

How are plant diseases spread?
There is little mystery in the answer
to that question, though plant
scientists, entomologists, and others
are constantly adding to our k n ow ledge
of the subject. Man, domestic
animals, rodents, slugs, snails,
birds, insects, wind and water are
among the more common agencies
that spread plant diseases. Insects
are the most important spreaders
of certain types of diseases, according
to the results of tests conducted
at the Idaho college of agriculture.
Perhaps you have wondered just
what causes plant diseases. Plant
diseases have about the same
causes as diseases of animals and
humans. Fungi and bacteria cause
many plant diseases. Others are
caused by a group of organisms
known as viruses, which are too
small to be detected with the most
powerful microscope.
Wind and rain act as agencies
for spreading many plant diseases.
In some of the winter wheat growing
areas of the country the sppres
of the stinking ant are blown in
such quantities that “ smut showers”
occur and many thousands of
spores fall on every square foot of
ground. Birds may also carry fungus
spores. In one case a single
downy woodpecker was found to be
carrying over 750,000 spores of the
chestnut blight fungus.
The secret of control for many
virus diseases lies in the control of
insects, which are the principal
means of spreading these diseases
in the field. Much can be done to
prevent the spread of plant diseases
in general by seed treatment and
by general sanitary practices
around the farm . Burning of diseased
plants and disinfection of
pruning tools and various containers
are examples of proper sanitary
practices.
“77ie Babe in the Blazing House”
H e l l o e v e r y b o d y :
These adventures provide a cross-section of life, and if
they didn’t show its grimmer side occasionally, they wouldn’t
show a faithful picture. That’s why I chose for this time a story
I found unusually gripping because it demonstrates so clearly
how close we may be at any time to tragedy. Mary Ann Grob
of New York City, who tells this adventure, was only a child of
nine when it happened, and this, for me, added particular
poignancy to the tale.
Imagine running back into a blazing house to rescue your
eight-months’-old baby brother only to find the smoke so dense
you couldn’t see what you were doing.
That’s what happened to Mary. The time was the fall of
1921, around September, and at that time Mary’s father and
mother and Mary's three brothers lived in Thayer, a sm all m ining town
in the lower part of West Virginia.
Thayer is a valley, situated between two large hills. To get out of
the valley, Mary tells us. you had to ride on a sort of incline. It was a
box-shaped affair, the car, let up and down the side of the hill by
means of a cable.
On this fateful morning M ary’s mother and dad had to go to town,
where mother was going to have her teeth fixed. Before she left she
called Mary, who was the eldest child, aside and warned her to watch
the three younger children, her brothers, while her parents were away,
Mary had occasion later, as you will see, to recall that warning.
Of the three John was the oldest brother, then came six-yearold
Pete, and last of all little Eddie, who rould show only a scant
eight months. Mary had her hands full keeping them all out
of mischief, and when night began to fall she began to glance
nervously out the window, wondering why mother and dad d idn’t
come. The younger children grew frightened with the approach
of darkness, and. at their urging, not to mention her own uneasiness,
Mary finally bolted all the doors and windows.
Children Were Locked Inside House.
To set the scene for this story it is necessary to explain that
next to the house they had a little wash-house, where M a ry ’s
dad used to wash when he came home from work. This washhouse
had a little coal stove in it. On this particular afternoon
the stove was lighted, but with the children locked inside the
house there was no one to tend it or check tbe dampers.
And so it came to pass that as the children sat huddled in the darkness,
queer red shadows, ghostly and lengthening, began to dance on
the walls of the children's room. Alarmed, the children began to w him per,
and at length, unable to stand the strain any longer, Mary went to

This historic York river of Virginia
is an example of the way in
which too m uch land in clean cultivated
crops, and land worn out and
abandoned because of too much
row cropping, m ay increase sedimentation
in a stream. Sediment
has been accumulating in the York
river during the last 27 years at a
rate five tim e s' as great as during
the preceding 57-year period, the
soil conservation service finds.
Carl Brown, geologist in charge of
the studies, says this sedimentation
is the result of increased erosion on
the slopes draining into the headwaters
of the river—slopes on which
in recent years there has been an
increase in land either in cleancultivated
crops or abandoned because
of too much row-crop fa rm ing.
A comparison of navigation charts
prepared by the coast and geodetic
survey indicating water depths on
the stream in 1857 and 1911 shows
that during that 54-year period approximately
5,600 acre-feet of the
soil from the watershed settled as
sediment in the York river estuary.
Sediment accumulated at the rate of
more than 100 acre-feet a year.
From 1911 to 1938, when scientists
of the service made soundings to
determine the extent of accumulation,
15,293 acre-feet—566 acre-feet
a year—lodged in the river bed.
In determining the amount and
rate of accumulation, the surveyors
took water depths at the same points
along the river at which measurements
were made in 1911.

Of all commodities retailed in the
United States, agricultural equipment
bears the lowest advertising
expense. In other words, when a
farmer buys farm machinery less
of his money goes to defray the
cost of advertising that commodity
than it does in the purchase of
many other advertised products.
This is the finding of the Twentieth
Century fund.
An advertising analysis recently
conducted by the fund discloses that
out of each dollar spent on farm
machinery but 1.6 cents goes to advertising.
This compared to 8.2
cents by tobacco manufacturers; 6.7
I cents for confectionery and bottled
goods; 6 2 cents for groceries; 6.1
for furniture; 4 cents for automo-
! biles; 3.7 for clothing; approximatej
ly 3 cents for home furnishings;
i and 2.2 for hardware.
“ In the black pall she stumbled against something—the crib—she
thought.”
the window and looked out to see what was causing the strange play of
lights on the wall. Then she understood—the wash-house was on fire!
Remember, this was no grown-up. This was a nine-year-old child
with the care and responsibility of three younger brothers on her shouli
ders. And now, as the fire spread to the m ain house, igniting the old,
dry wood like tinder, the children fled from the blazing wall into the
j open air, Mary as scared as any.
This will explain, perhaps, how it happened that on looking
around, they discovered that eight-months-old Eddie was missing.
Mary, who was frantic by this tim e, berated John for leaving
the baby behind, aa she had understood he had taken Eddie from
his crib while she was looking after getting Pete out. But John
protested that he had thought Mary was taking Eddie, and so
hadn't bothered to go after him .
Meanwhile, inside the burning house, little Eddie lay asleep
in his crib. The thought of her beloved little brother in that
blazing inferno was too much for Mary. With no sager heads
to dissuade her, she rushed back inside the burning house, groped
her way through dark, smoke-filled halls to the room where the
baby lay asleep.
Smoke Was So Thick She Could Hardly See.
By this time, Mary says, the smoke was getting so thick that she
could hardly see. Reaching the bedroom she found herself in the center
of a dense, rolling fog, choking her, blinding her so that she could
not see her hand before her face. Heat seared her eyeballs, tore at her
air-famished lungs. But the nine-year-old girl had made a promise—a
promise to a mother who trusted her to care for the younger ones. Mary
could hear her mother’s last words echoing in her ears as she groped
her way to where she thought the crib should be. “ Look after them
while I'm gone, Mary. I ’m trusting you.”
The flames were searing hot now, but Mary had but one thought:
She must get Eddie out. In the black pall she stumbled against something—“
the crib” —she thought. Hurriedly she reached down, grabbed
what she thought to be Eddie and almost delirious now with the desire
to escape from those hungry flames she rushed out of the house into the
open air.
Outside, safe under the open sky again, she thought of the
bundle in her arms. In the smoke-suffused house, Mary says
herself, “ I did not know for sure whether I had him or not.”
Now. obsessed by a horrible premonition of possible disaster she
dared not put into words, she forced herself to look down.
When you contemplate how easy it would be for a nearly hysterical
child of Mary's age to mistake her precious burden in a fog of rolling
smoke you will understand how close is the line between happiness
and tragedy. F or had Mary's eyes met, not what they did see. but
something else, this story would not have the happy ending it now has.
Yes, it was Kddie, crying for all he was worth. And was Mary glad?
You answer that one. I'll just go on to add that when Mary's mother
and dad got home all that was left of the house was the standing chimney.

Appendicitis Fatalities Show Increased Ratt
A g r i c u l t u r a l N e w s
Close observers of conditions in
the farm implement industry now
believe that sales for the year will
probably run about 10 per cent under
the 1938 dollar totals.

The oldest horse of which England
h t* any record died at the age of
60 years. In this country, so far as
we know at the moment, the oldest
> horse lived to be 52 years old.
The depression is responsible for
an increasing death rate among victims
of acute appendicitis, according
to two Cleveland doctors.
Drs. F. H. Kelly and R M Watkins,
observing the mounting death
rate in a study of 2.000 consecutive
cases at Women's hospital here, report
that appendicitis victims without
funds hesitate to summon medical
aid when an attack occurs and
trv to treat themselves.
H alf of the victims studied were
hospitalized in the more prosperous
years of 1930 to 1935; the rest between
1931 and 1936 The death
rate among the first 1,000 was 9 per
cent; among the second 1,000, 23
per cent. The doctors reported their
study in the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
“ During the depression years.”
they wrote, "patients delayed operation
29 per cent longer than in better
times. This surely increased the
m ortality rate.
“ If economic conditions improve,
this delay on the patient’s part wi.i
be lessened, but in the meantime
persons should be told to pocket
their pride and seek medical aid re
gardless of their circumstances, ii
they notice pain anywhere in the
abdom inal region.”

Milk Control B ill Signed — Gov.
Heil signed the FreehofT bill modifying
and extending for two years the

have expired Dec. 31. The law authorizes
the department of agriculture

Lobbyists Report Pay—Thirty-five
legislative lobbyists filed reports with
the secretary of state showing they
received $4,909 from clients for their

Gov’t to Store Grain—Officials of
agricultural conservation associations

have purchased 15 circular steel
bins which w ill be used for corn
storage under the ever-normal granary
program of the Agricultural A djustment
Administration. O t h e r
available storage facilities in these |
areas, it was found, are in use. Each
bin w ill hold 1,950 bushels of corn.
Revenue May Be Sufficient—Gov.
Heil’s financial strategists have been
making a close study of anticipated
state revenues for next year in the
hope that the chief executive might
find it unnecessary to call the legislature
back in special session to pass
a tax bill. A possibility that receipts
from the revenue laws already
on the statute books might yield
more money than was expected and
also that business conditions might
be much improved was weighed.
High School Pupils Increase— An
increase of 2.500 pupils in state high
school enrollments for 1939 was noted
by the Wisconsin Education association.
Preliminary reports indicated
that 158,000 children were now
attending Wisconsin high schools.
The association pointed out that d u ring
the last five years state high
school enrollments have increased
20.000 with most of the new enrollments
attributed to pupils from rural
areas now transported to district
schools by bus.
Service Code Law Renewed—A
bill authorizing codes of fair practice
for four service trades was signed
by Gov. Heil. The bill, passed on
the final day of the legislative session,
replaces the former trade practices
law which expired in July.
The new law does not apply to
counties with a population of under
30.000, thus exempting 41 of Wisconsin's
71 counties, or to locations
of under 5.200 except in Milwaukee
county. The code law effects barbers.

in markets long held by established

well advertised in local newspapers.
But under instructions from a president
who knew the power of underselling,
salesmen sold each grocer
one or two loaves less than the
store’s normal demand. Grocers
were soon telling late afternoon
customers, “ I ’m sorry we are all
sold out of that bread.” It was not
very long before storekeepers as
well as customers unconsciously
thought of it as the fastest selling
brand and therefore the best bread.
Grocers unconsciously recommended
it to customers and customers
soon began demanding it of grocers
and its success was assured.

I French masses cried for bread and
failing to get it brought on the
j French revolution. But when a present
day advocate of revolution in
this country recently made a speech
he said: “ Why should the citizens—
at least 90 per cent of them—be
| imprisoned behind the cruel bars of
want when within
their grasp there
are plenty of
shoes, of clothes,
of motor cars, of
refrigerators to
which they are
entitled?”
From this point
of view it is the
salesmen who sell
modern conveniences
who are
our most im portant national asset
for the prevention of revolutions. We
have 7 per cent of the world's popu*
lation and starting with a wilderness
have created and own today
more than half of the world's wealth.
Intelligent salesmanship and mass
production have distributed this
wealth so widely that stringent im migration
laws are required.
The new industries created and
developed in this country in the past
50 years now give employment to
10,000.000 men and women. Each
new industry, whether it be automobiles,
radio or rayon represents
a new idea that has had to be first
sold to the American people. It is
significant that in this same period
foreign countries, that have not developed
their newspapers and publications
as advertising vehicles for
the dissemination of new ideas about
things to buy, have not developed a
single great new industry. If the
United States has reached the point
when revolutionists must cry for
motor cars and refrigerators to get
attention, it would seem that we are
well on our way to prosperity.

lemons. At a meeting of the New
York Zoological society, Mr.
Christopher Coates, an official of
the aquarium, recently demonstrated
that an entire battery of
neon lamps could be run by fixing
the terminals to a large live eel
from South American waters
which is known to give off a tremendous
discharge. He clamped
two flexible metal bands round its
body, connected these to the neon
lamps, and tickled the eel into activity.
The bulbs flashed brilliantly.
When a small electric motor
was attached to the bands and
the eel again tickled into action,
the audience saw the flywheel
spinning violently.

JOSEPH W. L a R IX E
TH E war in Europe is the
one subject of interest to
all our readers, but the moves
on the checkerboards of the
battlefields and diplomacy are
not easily understood.
America is being flooded
from every war-torn nation
with vast quantities of propaganda
for the purpose of influencing
public opinion m this
country. Reports of actual
events are so severely censored,
and so m any false reports
are 1 sued, that it is hard
to get a fair account of actual
happenings.
Scare headlines appear in
the daily papers of the world,
only to be contradicted or forgotten
in the next edition because
there was no actual
foundation for the statements
covered by such headings.
In the Weekly News Analysis
we are printing each week, our
readers find a concise factual
statement of events in Europe,
with such interpretation, explanation
and comment as will
make the report of these actual
happenings easily understood.
It provides the most
valuable coverage of the war
to be found in any publication.
Weekly News Analysis is
prepared for us each week by
Mr. Joseph W. La Bine, a careful
observer and talented writer,
who has made a thorough
study of European history of
modern times and of European
armaments.
Mr. La Bine is a product of
rural America. He was born
and raised in a small town
and completed his education
at a mid-western university,
where he majored in journalism.
Following his completion
of the journalism course, he
worked on a weekly newspaper,
before going into the metropolitan
field. He has specialized
as a commentator and is
recognized as having unusual
ability in that line. His Weekly
News Analysis, as it appears
in our columns, presents
evidence of that ability.
Our readers can confidently
accept Mr. La Bine’s statements
of war happenings, and
his comments, as the basis of
their discussions of the war.
evening. Miss Kragenbrink and pupils
had the school room decorated in true,
Hallowe’en spirit. The room was
trimmed with a ceiling of orange and
black streamers. Shocks of corn were
placed around the room anti on the
stage. At first part of evening pumpkin
jack o’ lanterns were the only litfht
and made the room so pleasant with
their soft yellow glow. The candy
sale was a success in every way, donated
by parents, and all sold out.
Parents brought sandwiches and cake,
which were served by Mrs. Ed. Peterson
and Mrs. Herman Hanke who
made cocoa and coffee. Games »»f all
kinds were played and many players
received nice prizes which were made
by Miss Kragenbrink. Pupils and
Miss Eleanor Peterson assisted Miss
Kragenbrink during the evening.
Miss Eleanor Peterson returned to
Wilmette Tuesday after a month’s vacation
at her home.
Mrs. Matelski and daughter Patricia
Anne and son Donald made a visit
Mr. and Mrs. A rt Aanonsen and
Irma visited at the August Borchardt
