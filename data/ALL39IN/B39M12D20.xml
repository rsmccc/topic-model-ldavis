should read the statement by National
Chairman Davis 
I have examined the papers o f Mr 
Jas Staszak R R 1 Merrillan who
has done considerable soliciting in this
county and find that he is authorized
to solicit and receive money for Polish
War Relief under Permit No 38
granted by the Department o f State 
Washington D C All funds collected
by Mr Staszak are sent to the
Polish Red Cross and are expended
by that organization Such funds do
not pass through any branch o f the
American Red Cross 
Unless otherwise specified all contributions
to authorized solicitors for
the American Red Cross go through
the regular channels o f that organization
and are apportioned as needs
may require Thus during the past
week $100 000 was apportioned by
headquarters for both Polish and Finnish
war relief 
If you wish to contribute for the
relief o f any country in which you
are particularly interested give your
money to John R Bolger at the
Jackson County Bank stating which
country

The Finns have double reason for
their stubborn resistance against the
attempt o f Russia to force a puppit
government upon them Russia for
many years has been endeavoring to
Russianize Finland and are now using
armed force in an attempt to force
communism upon them 
Ten year sago a Finn even then a
self imposed exile from Finland directed
an unsuccessful attempt o f the
Communist Party to capture or destroy
the co operative movement he
narrowly escaped from Finland after
the civil war o f 1918 and has been
in Russia ever since So have the
other members o f his cabinet namely
Mauri Rosenberg finance minister 
Thure Lehen minister o f interior 
Inkeri Lehtinen education Armas
Irkin agriculture and others Today 
that same man Otto Kunsinen is
prime minister o f the puppet government
set up by the Russians to transform
Finland into a Soviet State 
Since more than half the families of
Finland are members o f co operatives
which handle between 35 per cent
and 40 per cent o f the business o f
the country the Kunsinen government
is a serious threat to a major
part o f the Finnish economy 
To show how the Cmmunists have
been at work in our own state trying
to wreck our co operatives the following
is taken from the Co operative
League News Service In the early
days o f the Co operative movement in
America the Finns were the largest
single section o f its membership and
it was logical that the Communists
should use a Finn to direct the attempt
to rule or ruin the movement 
In 1930 the American Communist
Party at the command o f the Communist
International made extravagant
demands upon the Central Cooperative
Wholesale pioneer co op
wholesale o f Superior Wis which
now serves 140 co operative stores in
Minnesota Wisconsin and Northern
Michigan They demanded large sums
o f money and proposed that such
contributions be concealed from the
rank and file membership o f the societies
making up the Wholesale 
These demands were flatly refused 
reports Oscar Cooley editor o f the
 Co operative Builder Thereupon
the Party launched a virulent propagandist
attack upon the Wholesale
and its executives and tried to persuade
the membership to desert the organization 
This attack too stemmed
from the Comintern 
Otto Kunsinen at that time was
leader o f the Communist Party of
Finland residing in Russia and also
a secretary o f the Comintern Kunsinen
took the leading part among the
officials o f the Comintern in pressing
the attack upon the Central Co operative
Wholesale and its affiliated societies 
Early in 1931) Kunsinen wrote
a lengthy open letter from the Communist
Party o f Finland to the Finnish
workers o f America urging them
to desert the Central Co operative
Wholesale in favor o f the Communist
Party and reviling by name the executives
o f the Wholesale This open
letter was published in the Daily
Worker in March 1930 Kunsinen
also sent a telegram demanding that
George Halonen and Eskel Ronn 
leading executives o f the Wholesale 
be deposed and that Communists be
given their positions 
It even went so far that in the summer
o f 1930 Kunsinen sent his wife
and K Manner to Superior bearing
the credentials o f the Comintern to
take control o f the Wholesale for the
Party 
All o f these efforts were an utter
failure The Communist influence
was completely rooted out o f the
Wholesale The Communists continue
to attack and revile the Wholesale
to this day Thwarted in their
attempt to capture what was then the
largest single organization in The Cooperative
League o f the U S A the
Communists set up their own co operatives
and established a co operative
wholesale to serve them but
all o f these organizations have since
disappeared 
Co operative leaders in both Finland
and the United States have taken
a definite stand against totalitarian
dictatorship whether Communist
or Fascist for they realize that only
by the use o f democratic methods can
economic democracy be built and
preserved 
So with Russia s determination to
Russianize Finland and set up a communist
government the Finns are
desperately fighting to preserve their
social and political democracy the
war rages on 
The Jackson County Co operative
Advancement Association composed
o f delegates from 15 co operatives in
the county join in wishing you a

by G eorge Malcolm Smith
On one day in the year time stand still It is the one day when
men find respite from the turmoil and the trumpery o f modern
life the one day when men renounce routine and d o ff the
mask o f modern efficien cy to return to the simple enjoym ents
o f years gone by 
Christmas thank heaven can never be modernized It remains
unalterably and blessedly old fashioned A t Christmas all the
chromium plated gimcracks o f modern Interior Decoration surrender
to the pristine simplicity o f holly wreaths and spruce
boughs The oil burner fo r all its convenience suddenly seems
a shabby substitute for a brisk blaze in a fireplace and the
autom obile becomes a clumsy contraption that any man o f
spirit would gladly swap for an open sleigh The highball and
the cocktail are disdained as hasty makeshifts while more appropriate
libations are concocted with meticulous care The
Month s Best Seller stands neglected on the drugstore shelf 
while sentimentalists revel shamelessly in the timeless tale o f
Ebenezer Scrooge and the intricate point and counterpoint o f
modern music seem tiresome in contrast with the ingenuous
melodies o f ancient carols 
At Christmas all that is good and true transcends all that is
mean and false At Christmas artificial values crumble before
ancient verities Neglected friends take precedence over business
contacts The gratitude o f a child becomes more desirable
than approbation from the most im poitsnt man in the com munity 
A happy home comes to mean more than all the honors
that a man can achieve And all the vainglorious struttings
and rantings o f the w orld s dictators and the little tin gods o f
y our  Yn and mine seem in effably silly compared with the
simple dignity o f One who many centuries ago walked quietly
among His people imparting with infinite patience and calm 
a phi osophy that will live forever in the hearts o f honest men 
And so we wish you a very happy and very old fashioned

As the time approaches for the revocation
o f our trade treaty with Japan
the propaganda from its press
agencies is becoming very noticeable 
It is so different in tone from the insolent
and impudent stuff which the
same agencies flooded the newspapers
o f the world before o u t State department
eerved notice that the treaty
would be set aside at the end o f the
six months period When that notice
was given the Japanese press was
quite strong in its warnings that our
country was endangering peace The
same newspapers now are asserting
the unfailing brotherly love o f the
Japanese people toward our nation 
it is not the holiday season which
has so suddenly inspired the Japs
toward peace on Earth good will
toward men Its motives are no different
now than when its war makers
were breathing death and destruction
in our direction Were the treaty to
be renewed instead o f abrogated the
same cocky bullies who are whining
now would be assuring their own
people that this country was scared
into the renewal afraid o f the might
o f Japan if we failed to heed its demands 
The Russian onslaught upon
Finland may be blinding some folks
to the even more brutal and devastating
attack o f Japan upon China but
not a sufficient number o f them to
change the sentiment held before
Europe started its eruption Japan
is just as like Japan as Russia is like
Russia and the difference in their
forms o f brutality and barbarism is
about as great as that between tweedle 
dee and tweedle dum 
Not all the influence toward our
trucking to Japan comes from that
country nor is it necessarily inspired
by it Japan industry and commerce
have built as many great fortunes
here as they have at home Much o f
our importations from there such as
silks porcelain and pottery have been
o f luxury goods upon which both importers 
wholesalers and retailers reap
great profits Our treasury department
reports the extent o f importations
upon the Japanese invoices
rather than upon the sale price here 
Were it possible to obtain it the selling
price would be interesting Go
into any o f the big city department
stores in the present season where
Japanese goods are piled high and
sold at prices many times the valuations
in the figures indicating importations
and it is easy to realize why
the importer crowd are as busy as
the Japs in urging our Department o f
State not to provoke Japan There
is a profit reason for their great interest
in renewing the treaty The
fact that thousands are idle in this
country because o f such Japanese
competition does not concern them 
A former diplomat o f our State
department is particularly loud in asserting
that unless the State department
backs down and renews the
treaty we may run the risk o f a
war with Japan This country wants
no war with Japan or any other country 
but if the time has come that
our country is obliged to fix its trade
policy and form its sentiment subject
to dictation by the Japanese it
would be well to discover that fact 
There are measures short o f war 
which would be even more effective 
and one o f them would be to stop all
imports from that country and let
that country have the idle labor instead
o f our own Another would be
to stop shipping raw materials for its
industries and equipment material for
its baby killers in China Our Secretary
o f State knows that and so
do the Importers who are hounding
him to reverse his policy 
A full column appears in the daily
press coming from one o f the Jap
war lords seeking to pacify the hostile
sentiment aroused by the atrocities
o f his armies in China He explains
that the killing o f nnnocent
men women and children by bombing
is accidental and not intentional He
would have us believe that dropping
bombs upon American missions hospitals
and homes is merely an accident 
o f war One way to stop such 
accidents is to stop skipping the cotton 
metals and plane parts which
make the bombing possible Fortunately 
congress will be in session
when the time for ending the treaty
arrives and the Japs and their sympathizers
may learn that our Department
o f State is still functioning
without the dictation nor wheedling
they are attempting 
There are predictions that the approaching
session o f congress will be
a do nothing session with but little
going on except oratorical outbursts
about Russian and Japan and upon
domestic issues the passage o f appropriation
bills etc Some intimate
that it also will be a short session 
possibly ending in May It may be
remembered that similar prophecies
have been made at this season in
form er years Frequently the sessions
following have been among the longest
and the legislation among the
most important What congress will
do at any session is about as uncertain
as the weather What may happen
at home or abroad in the next
six months is well beyond the possibility
o f successful prediction 
The matter o f taxes supposedly will
be in abeyance because o f an approaching
presidential campaign but
tax measures may loom up large by
April when the swelling deficit again
comes under consideration Among
other proposals is that o f Secretary
Wallace for a new tax to raise the
funds for agriculture a sort o f process
tax on the certificate plan It
is not attracting favorable comment 
The processors are aroused by the
proposal and farmers are not inclined
to favor a special tax upon the
consumption of their products Why
agriculture should have such a tax
for its funds while all other government
expenses come from general
forms o f taxation is not so plain The
president has suggested new taxes for
the new billion dollar armament program 
but not in concrete terms He
is not likely to suggest an increased
levy upon steel companies ship yards 
cannon and munition factories for
that purpose Nor is anybody proposing
to levy a special tax upon government
officials and emplovers for
the civil service emplovers The farmers
pay their big portion o f national
taxation so that the reason for laying
special taxes upon their products

FUTURE FARM ERS ORG AN IZE
The Black River Falls chapter o f
Future Farmers o f America held their
first meeting in the Agriculture room
on December 3 Glen Gearing acted
as temporary chairman and Emmet
Kampen as temporary secretary 
Twenty six members made application
to the organization and the following
officers were elected 
President Glean Gearing 
Vice President Emmet Kampen 
Secretary Raymond Lowe 
Treasurer Antone Metalas 
Reporter George Harper 
The chapter was initiated into the
Future Farmer Organization Wednesday
night Dec 6th by the Blair
chapter A short welcome speech was
made by the local president Glen
Gearing and a regular parliamentary
meeting was held by the Blair officers 
Several o f the Blair Chapter
members gave talks on the achievements
that can be won by a Future
Farmer member after which the initiation
was held The members were
led in and were spoken to by each
member o f the Blair degree team 
The Greenhand pins were then presented
to each member and the meeting
was adjourned There were 26
members initiated from our local
chapter A fter the meeting a basket
ball game was played between the
two chapters in which Black River
was defeated Refreshments consisting
o f hot chocolate cookies and
cup cakes were then served 
CO UNTY A G E N T NOTES
for the little six per cent o f total appropriations
paid out to them is not
so plain The nations food supply is
just as important as national defense 
for instance 
The glass makers now are under
fire by the Department o f Justice 
Twelve o f the leading corporations
are charged with controlling the production
and sale o f glass in this country 
The investigation has been carried
on in connection with the more
extensive survey o f the manufacturers
o f building matrials o f all kinds 
The Department has not disclosed
other than general information but
indictments have been brought in several
o f the larger cities alleging that
combinations o f material films contractors 
etc have been making excessive
profits to the detriment o f the
building program In several instances
the Department has effected agreements
to cease and desist which
take the plac o f threatened prosecution 
The anti trust suits and actions
under the Sherman act for years have
been successful but for some reason
the enforcement division has always
been short o f funds to make the application
o f the law verv general 
MERLIN HULL 
Christmas
With the approach o f Christmas 
thoughts turn from the material side
of farming and other business to a
celebration o f the birth and life o f
one whose teachings have led young
and old alike to greater things The
meaning o f Christmas has been admirably
set forth in a letter just received
by the county agent from our
state 4 H club leaders 
Calling attention as it does to adult
responsibility toward youth we take
opportunity to quote from it especially
for the benefit o f 4 H club members 
their parents and leaders 
 So Christmas is here again Once
again we worship at the cradle o f the
Child Again the importance o f childhood
makes its impact on our minds 
and we bend our every effort and
thought to make Christmas time a
cherished memory for children There
is no richer heritage than precious
memories 
 At Christmas time the old become
young in heart and youth is exalted 
We would remind those with most of
life before them that the gift given at
Christmas time is symbolic o f the
adoration o f the Wise men the lighted
tree heavens with a star that
guided the Wise Men and shepherds
to the humble stable and Christmas
music an emplation o f the songs
o f the heavenly hosts 
 We would remind youth that human
freedom is a Christmas gift to
all mankind eminating from the spirit
o f good will o f unselfish service 
o f charity and o f search for the truth
which are the abiding teachings o f
Him whose birth we celebrate that
these teachings have given to the
world hospitals and universities 
homes for the unfortunate and a vast
system o f education and social welfare 
including 4 H Club work 
 We would wish nothing better for
the youth o f today than an appreciation
o f the beauty and historical importance
of his teachings and His example 
We would have our puzzled
youth know that in spite o f wars and
rumors o f war that the world has
come a long way in 1900 years that
each impact of the Christmas time
sends us another step toward a better
world 
 This is the real meaning o f Christmas 
It carries a message o f Hope
and confidence and the only program
o f human relationships whereby man
to man shall brothers be for all that 
1940 Soil Program
T obacco
The county committee wishes to
call attention to all new tobacco
growers that is farmers who did not
harvest tobacco during the period
from 1935 to 1939 that they must
apply to the county office for a tobacco
allotment not later than February
1 1940 This applies only to
those farmers who did not grow tobacco
from 1935 to 1939 but wish
to grow tobacco in 1940 
Lime Loans
Under the 1940 Agricultural Conservation
program farmers are to be
given an opportunity to get lime and
phosphate in time for use in 1940 
to take the place o f a part o f their
1940 conservation payment 
The lime may be used on crop land
or pasture The phosphate which has
a guaranteed test o f 45 per cent must
be used only on non soil depleting
crops That means that it can be
used on pastures hay meadows or on
land at the time o f seeding to legumes
and grasses When applied to
seedings the nurse crops if planted
must be pastured off clipped green
or cut green for hay 
Farmers who expect to take part in
the 1940 program can get lime and
superphosphate in place o f the cash
payment that they earn by co operating 
Farmers have a choice o f getting
their payment or a part o f it 
in advance in the form o f lime or su 
 perphosphate or if they prefer to buy
their own lime or superphosphate 
they may do so and get their conservation
payment later One advantage
o f taking the materials in place o f
cash is that it allows farmers to
apply the materials without having
their money tied up for several
months before being reimbursed 
If enough farmers in Jackson county
are interested in getting either lime
or superphosphate under this plan 
the county observation committee will
make the necessary arrangements to
get the materials 
In order that contracts for these
materials can be let in the near future 
the State Agricultural Conservation
Committee must be notified as to
the amounts o f these materials that
will be needed in each county 
County committees are asked to
have their requests on file in Madison 
by Dec 15 Farmers who expect to 1
take part in the 1940 program and 
who want to get either lime or phosphate
in place o f their payments I
should see their community or county
committeemen at once

The annual Alma Center Dairy
Rally was held Friday evening Dec 
15th in the high school gym The
event which has in form er years been
staged in the lodge hall has been
gaining in momentum year by year 
so that a larger place was deemed
advisable this time The capacity of
the gym was well taxed President
Rubenbauer stated in his opening remarks
that neither he nor any o f the
cheese factory management could define
the object o f the occasion with
free admission program lunch and
access to free prizes for all who saw
fit to attend When later on Cap
Waller took the floor he solved and
settled the matter by naming that
object as fellowship fellowship 
the sweetest association this tide o f
Heaven It was a wholesome wholehearted
gesture on the part o f the
cheese factory management and all
seemed to fall into the spiirt o f it 
Viewing the results and pondering the
splendid motives and all the work
entailed on the part o f some few men
and women it was truly marvelous 
Mr Rubenbauer introduced the
speaker o f the evening Mr Tom Stodola 
o f Black River Falls His remarks
came straight from the heart
and were driven straight from the
shoulder o f a good Co op man Then
came the Barn Dance with the Hay 
L oft Sweetheart Lu Lu Belle Mrs 
Dana Waters and her company who
staged a square dance at intervals
during the evening interspersing the
rest o f the numbers The WLS Barn
Dance has nothing on those becomingly
be bonnetted buxom belles o f the
ball and their Rageddy Man Beau
Brummels who were all very evidently 
the envy o f many in the audience
for as Mr and Mrs Will Bopp struck
up the familiar and tantalizing dance
airs one could detect in the audience
an urge to get on their toes and trip
the light fantastic along with them 
It was a cosmopolitan crowd with
a cosmopolitan group entertaining 
farmers housewives teachers preacher 
oldsters and youngsters and for
the tops o f the evening the manager
o f the cheese factory Harold Ness 
had the blessed foresight and forethought
to submit a special invitation
to that lovable pair not from the
 hill country but from Eau Claire 
Harry and Nellie Van Gorden who
were always the sports and joined so
cordially in our activities when they
lived among us It did the hearts o f
us all sheer good to have them in
our midst again and let none doubt
that they were glad to be remembered
and to respond with their presence 
Mrs Van Gorden confided that they
were tickled pink to be invited and
that is the superlative o f being pleased 
No less grand and glorious was
it to be favored with the presence o f
that unimitable gentleman o f eternally
youthful spirit Mr Herbert Duxbury 
o f Blair He rendered for our
enjoyment two splendid readings
from memory We hoped he might
sing for us as on former occasions
but he confined himself to readings
this time A little family from York 
the Robert Wilsons traveled to our
meeting and father and three young
sons sang in quartette a lovely
thing to behold A t the end o f the
program the prizes about 75 in number 
were also distributed The
variety o f prizes was too great to
enumerate coming as they did from
the shelves and the stock o f the shops
and institutions about the town and
very generous they were too In addition
a sizeable chunk o f cheese was
presented each and every one who
had any part in the program which
truly made it a night o f bringing
home the bacon for many 
When the invitation was given to
come to the laden tables for lunch a
la cafeteria and all rose to their
feet the sight was breath taking It
wa reported that there were nearly
400 but they looked like a thousand 
When all were served there were
quantities o f food remaining It had
all been prepared and provided by the
cheese factory management and their
ladies The physical man and the social
spirit were so well fed that night 
there is little doubt that sleep was
stalled at many portals until the
small hours o f morning And may
there be returns o f the occasion

Four years ago have passed since that
sad day
When one we loved was called away

Within our hearts he liveth still 
You have left this world o f sorrow
And are free from pain and harm 
And now rest in peace and comfort
In the Blessed Savior s arms 
Sadly missed by his wife Jennie

In loving memory o f our dear son

Time speeds on two years have passed
Since Death it s gloom its shadows
cast
Within our home where all seemed
bright
And took from us a shining light 
We miss that light and ever will 
His vacant place there is none to fill 
For up in Heaven we will meet again 
Down here we mourn but not in vain 
Sadly missed by Parents and
Brothers lwp

Freshman Clast 
Citizenship is the chief topic being
dwelt on by the students in that
class Dolls towels and such items
are the results o f the efforts o f the
Home Ec class Energy which may
be needed soon since the exams are
not so far away is the Science subject
for the time Themes some
rather amusing and others not have
been written by our English class 
Future Hardys and Maughams are in
the making 
Sophom ores 
The Algebra class is still removing
brackets and braces from their problems 
It seems to be a review for
them Soon there won t be any problems
left 
The Biology classe have almost
completed a study on insects this
knowledge they hope to use when they
get out in the world and associate
with people and people 
 How Christianity Spread and the
trials o f the early Christians is a very
interesting subject for the World History
boys 
Juniors 
Somehow or ever the class in American
History has been transported
back to the days o f Andrew Jackson 
when the Hermitage was a happy
gathering place and Mrs Jackson
used to sit on the porch and smoke
her cob This however was not in
the text 
Up to their necks in acids we find
the chemists to be progressing rapidly
in this field As yet no one has
been burned or drowned 
Seniors 
The Sociology class has received
new work books to accompany their
texts on our changing order

Gossip
Who is it that some certain blonde
Merrillan girl thinks is pretty cute 
Who scared Alice Larson the other
night 
The basketball boosters have to
find a new hang out after the games
as it seems too late for some restaurant
to keep open 
Ernest Pesch s Model A seems to be
a 6uper car He only took nine students
to the game in it and they all
rode in comfort so we hear 
What freshman boy is it that delights
in making phony telephone
calls  Possibly to the Blair bowling
alleys 
Why was school so dead on Friday 
I ll tell you why it was because
Dippy was not there Neither was
Mary W hy 
Some people don t like the songs
we dedicated to them What s the
matter  Did they fit too weli 
Who did Valborg and Lois escort
Thursday night 
Raised donuts and the like tasted
pretty good at Gene Hanson s store
after the game with Merrillan We
appreciated it Gene thanks!
Why does Jeanette S get all the
breaks  As far as Fall Creek No 
9 he sure was good looking 
Eva and Price are having quite a
time in Hixton Since she came to
Taylor she feels quite unhappy 
Eileen and Morris Casper have a

If they keep up we ll always know
Their class when school is done
