WITTENBERG E n t e r p r is e

FORTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN, THURSDAY, MARCH 9, 19.19 NUMBER 17
Labor Bill Advanced Toward Passage
The Wisconsin Council of Agriculture
labor bill, labeled by its sponsors
“the employment peace act’* was well
on it* way to becoming law this week
after the assembly by a 54 to 44 vote
engrossed the bill and thus prepared
it for final passage. The lower house
is expected to complete action on the
bill this week and then send it over to
the senate for concurrence.
Forecast as the most controversial
subject scheduled for legislative action,
the measure lived up to advance
notices as the assembly debated for
two days, 10 hours in all, the merits
and demerits of the bill.
The bill, now beyond the amendable
stage in the assembly, would abolish
the present three man labor board and
replace it with a “fu ll time” three man
employment labor relations board, to
be appointed by the governor with
senate confirmation; sit down strikes,
secondary picketing and secondary
boycotts would be outlawed; seventyfive
per cent of a plant’s employes
would be required to put through a
closed shop contract; and strikes a ffecting
farm products would require a
10-day advance notice.
The 54-44 vote for engrossment
quite generally followed party lines
with Progressives against the measure
and Republicans and Democrats for it.
Exceptions were 16 Republicans and
Democrats from industrial areas who
voted against the bill and two Progressives
from rural areas who voted
with the coalition.
The Governor Attends
Governor Julius P. Heil was a surprise
visitor in the assembly chambers
Tuesday afternoon during the debate
on the labor bill. Shortly after the
Governor's arrival, Assemblyman Rubin,
Milwaukee, told assemblymen that
in a recent strike in Milwaukee, the
state chief executive had offered hi*
services in appointing arbiters. Mr.
Rubin, opponent of the bill, sought to
prove that labor was reasonable because
in this case the union agreed tr
the Governor’s suggestion but the employer
had said “ no.”
Observers in the assembly were
puzzled by the Governor’s appearance’
during the floor debate on a measure
pointing out that very rarely, if ever,
does this happen. However, the Governor,
a few weeks ago attended an
assembly judiciary hearing, and after
the hearing told the assemblymen that
he just came in to watch how “the
boys work.”
During the course of the labor bill’s
debate the galleries of the assembly
were packed with American Federation
of Labor representatives who
were in Madison attending a convention.
Relief Gets Attention
Relief came in for its share of attention
in the state legislature last
week with the introduction of a bill
which would make the state pay all
relief costs and a hearing on a bill
which proposes to raise 5 million dollars
relief revenue by taxing cigarettes
2c a package.
Under a bill by James Mace, Progressive,
the state would raise 14
million dollars yearly and assume the
entire cost of relief in the state.
(Relief in Wisconsin for 1938 was
$13,0 56 ,0 0 0 , of which llVfc million
came from local taxation and the rest
from the state.) Methods for raising
the money are not in the bill, but
Mace proposed that it be raised by a
tax on all gross incomes in excess of
$5,000.
Good points of having the state pay
all relief costs, as Mace sees it: 1. The
property taxpayer would be relieved
of the burden, thus helping the poorer
northern counties. 2. Disputes between
counties over responsibility for
cases will end. 3. Existing residence
requirements for relief recipients for
various villages, towns and countics
would be necessary.
Meanwhile the legislative joint
finance committee held a hearing on a
bill which would raise 5 million for relief
through a 2-cent tax on each
package of cigarettes. Opponents of
the bill, representing tobacco growers
and cigarette machine venders said
the tax would raise only lVi million
dollars, passage of the law would
cause the bootlegging of cigarettes in
this state since Iowa is the only adjoining
state with a similar tax, tobacco
is the fifth in volume revenue in
W’isconsin and a tax would have a
detrimental effect on the industry,
and the law would put cigarette machine
venders out of business.
Favoring the bill was Senator E rnest
Sauld, author of the measure,

TOTALS *18.592.88
John M. Smith, State Treasurer,
has announced that the Shawano county
municipalities’ share of thc state
liquor tax for the last six months of
1938 was $18,592.86. This amount was
apportioned among the cities, towns
and villages of Shawano county.
Under the law, revenue derived
from the liquor tax, minus the cost
of collection, is distributed every six
months to cities, towns and villages of
the state in proportion to population
in the last federal census to help reduce
the tax on general property.
Following is the final 1939 apportionment
to the cities, towns and villages
of Shawano county, based on
revenue derived during the last six
months of 1938:

Boxing Show Friday, March 17
A squad of about fifteen boys have j

here March 17 in the high school gym.
Everybody come and watch them slug
it out. On the 24th of March the best j
fighters will make up a team that will
travel to Marion and battle their

being made to have the Mosinee high

hour physical training period. The
Sophomore, Junior and Senior classes j
make up the second section and teams
representing these classes will compete
for the class championship.

Bruno Johnson, Irvin Jolin, Roland
Wendler, Ix»la Mae Behnke, Alyce McConley,

Caroline Field May
Soon Be Served By
Citizens State Bank
A number of examiners put in
several days this week at the Citizens
State Bank on behalf of the state
banking dc part ment and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation. The
Citizens State Bank jointly with many
people living in and near the village
of Caroline recently filed a petition
with the state banking department
asking for the establishment of a
Citizens State Bank office at Caroline.
The examination was made in preparation
for a decision by the banking department
in this matter.
The examiners completed their work
today. We learn from a reliable
source that chances are good that the
petition will be favorably acted upon
by the banking officials.

Badger Meeting
Biggest Success
In Eight Years
(From Shawano Leader.)
Between 1500 and 1600 people were
present at the largest and most successful
annual meeting the Consolidated
Badger has held since it was organized
eight years ago. Over 1400
were served lunch at the community
hall and from this number it was
estimated the attendance at the meeting
would reach 1600 or above.
The members and visitors heard
general manager George Rupple outline
the progress the Badger has made
during the past year, including the
development of the Appleton territory,
and the healthy expansion of the entire
Badger organization.
Mr. Rupple said that 86 million
pounds of milk had been handled
through Badger resources during the
past twelve months, which in any
man’s country is a whale of a lot of
milk.
Another highlight of the day was
the excellent talk given by Thomas G.
Stitts, head of the research department
of the Farm Credit administration.
The meeting was originally scheduled
to get under way promptly at ten
o’clock, but it was going on 11 a. m.
before the odd thousand farmers had
taken their places in the high school
gymnasium.
Quite unexpectedly, Dr. Metzger,
president of the St. Paul Bank for
cooperatives, was a guest.
After hearing reports of the officers,
slides were flashed on the screen listing
the balance sheet of the Badger at
the present time. Receipts and disbursements
were gone over carefully
during an hour and a half period.
From time to time questions arose as
to why that or this item seemed excessive.
The questions were readily
answered and explained thoroughly.
Some of the farmers complained of
having to pay service charges on their
milk checks at many of the banks.
Mr. Rupple explained that an agreement
had been put in effect with some
of the hanks wherein a standard rate
would be set, and the Badger would
pay it.
He said that one bank in particular
was charging 3 cents per check.
“That amount is excessive and we
cannot pay it. W'e have put up a
proposition to that bank and we hope
to have the difficulty ironed out within
the next week or ten days.”
Directors elected for the coming
year arc: Carl F. Sandberg, Mattoon;
J. T. Henderson, Eland; John Zoromski,
Galloway; O. B. Hagen, Wittenberg;
Oscar Holm, Tigerton; Alfred
L. Schmidt, Lyndhurst; A. H. Klebesadel,
Shawano; Henry G. Schmidt,
Bonduel; R. H. Wunsch, Advance;
Thomas Hardy, Appleton; and George
Ix*mke, Appleton.
The following resolutions committee
was appointed: Lawrence Jahnke,
Mattoon; Roy Meverden, Eland; E. R.
Schrank. Wittenberg; John Czerwonka,
Galloway; W’illiam F. Voelz, Tilleda;
Fred Harriman. Shawano; Adolph
Zcnk, Underhill; Len Bohm, Oconto
Falls; Joseph Griesbach, Appleton,
Edwin Zahnke, Appleton.
During the course of the day the
farmers were entertained by the Stone
sisters, a very fine local trio, and
Kathryn Hardy, tap dancer.
The directors will hold a meeting
within the next few days, possibly a
week, to elect officers.
The meeting was in charge of A. H.
Klehesadel, president, and his staff of
officers.

reports came from industries
like steel, automobile, silk, cotton
and tobacco. Payrolls dropped and
retail volume was ofT sharply. Secretary
of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau
Jr. said this was just a
“ breathing spell,” but he and other
administration leaders evidently
thought otherwise. Since Harry
Hopkins was appointed commerce
secretary in December to replace
Daniel C. Roper, unmistakable business
conciliation efforts have been
made. Among them:
Hopkins’ Speech. At Des Moines
Mr. Hopkins made his first major
speech as secretary of commerce,
announcing the New Deal’s emphasis
has shifted from reform to recovery.
Promises: There will be
no general tax rise this year; taxes
which “ freeze” the flow of capital
will be amended; the profit system
will be protected; small business,
p articularly, should be aided. But
there was no hint of a change in
the one U. S. policy that has done
more than anything else to alienate
business, namely, government
spending. The Hopkins plan: Balance
the budget and retire the debt
with taxes coming at current rates
from increased national income,
rather than substantially increasing
taxes at this time or reducing necessary
expenditures.
Morgenthau Backwater. January
19 found Mr. Morgenthau telling a
house appropriations committee
that from $400,000,000 to $450,000,000
new taxes were needed this year;
moreover that the U. S. public debt
lim it must be boosted from $45,000,-
000.000 (which will be reached by
Ju ly 1, 1940) to $50,000,000,000 or
more. The same day Mr. Hopkins
spoke, however, Mr. Morgenthau
told his press conference he still
favored hiking the debt lim it but
that a no-new-tax policy had been
adopted. Also, he asked congress
to study the present tax structure
with an eye to revisions. Many observers
believe Mr. Morgenthau has
been the New Deal's leading economy
advocate all along, probably
fathering the conciliation plan.
Congressional Hints. A pro-administration
congress must shift its
legislative program to satisfy White
House whims. So must an insurgent
congress shift to satisfy the nation.
Part loyal and part insurgent,
the seventy-sixth congress is now
plotting a course to carry out Mr.
Roosevelt’s recovery suggestions
first, then take another step to appease
business. Scheduled for hearing:
(1) repeal of the undistributed
surplus tax, plus reduction in capital
gains levy; (2) cut in expenditures,
continuing the rebel policy
that has already resulted in five
consecutive slashes in administration
appropriation bills; (3) revision
of Wagner labor act to insure equal
employer-employee rights; and (4)
reduction in social security payroll
taxes, with possible adoption of a
pay-as-you-go system. Wyoming’s
Sen. Joseph C. O ’Mahoney of the
much-feared federal monopoly investigation
committee has promised
no general anti-monopoly legislation
will be offered this session, giving
business another incentive.
Labor Peace. Notoriously unsuccessful
in settling differences between
C. I. O. and A. F. of L., the
U. S. labor department has been
completely ignored in new administration
gestures. Secretary Hopkins
rightly maintains labor peace is a
prerequisite to business upturn, so
his department now takes the lead.
Scheduled immediately is a peace
parley probably with President
Roosevelt in the arbiter’s role,
whose success would prevent a bitter
factional fight over Wagner act
amendments. Hearings open May
1. Chief stumbling block is that
C. I. O .’s John Lewis offers a formula
for chartering all C. I. O. unions
by A. F. of L., or vice versa, leaving
two opposing unions in many
fields. A. F. of L .’s W illiam Green
denounces the plan as "impossible.”
Sour Notes. Too many wary business
men regard Mr. Hopkins’
speech—keynote of the entire recovery
campaign—not as a sincere administration
gesture but as a political
buildup for Mr. Hopkins’ presidential
nomination in 1940. By posing,
sincerely or otherwise, as business’
friend he is taking the only
road now open if the administration
hopes to gain a considerable support
from business in the next election.
Disregarding the possibility of insincerity,
other financial circles
doubt the wisdom of continued U. S.
spending. Most charitable Wall
Street view is that New Deal theorists
are belatedly discovering the
impossibility of taxing a nation back
to good times. Least charitable
view is that of Manhattan’s G uaranty
Trust company, which minces
no words about spending. While
agreeing with Mr. Hopkins that an
$80,000,000,000 annual national in-

m aintains that this alone would be
no index of prosperity. A better
idea: To encourage private investment
by a government policy which
eschews federal spending via “ long
range investment” in wealth creating

no tangible encouragement in a

be sure of great hospitality in both
congress and the country.”
T r u n s p o r t a t i o n
Current legislative proposals to
aid railroads rest mainly on the
thesis that all transportation must
be co-ordinated to eliminate favoritism
and duplication of service.
Even more pointed than bills fathered
by California's Rep. C larence
F Lea and Montana’s Sen.
Burton K. Wheeler is the proposal
of the Association of American Railj
roads, just submitted to the house
interstate commerce committee.
Its gist: All rail, water and motor
transport systems would be regulated
by a single federal agency.
While the interstate commerce commission
would continue to fix rates,
financial and administrative functions
would be vested in five $12,000-
a-year men appointed by the President.
The board’s tasks: (1) to
determine the “ relative economy
and fitness” of all carriers; (2) to
ferret out reports of U. S. subsidies
to common carriers other than
the railroads.
Complained Attorney R. V. Fletcher,
general counsel for the railroads:
“ Under present conditions there are
no good times for the railroads.
When earnings are not good we
can’t raise the rates and when they
are good we are told that a rate
increase would be contrary to a
sound economic end.”
Congress
Nebraska's Rep. John J . Cochran
has fought steadily for President
Roosevelt’s ill-fated reorganization
bill which failed last session amid
charges of “ dictatorship.” Now before
congress is a Cochran-sponsored
compromise bill designed to
eliminate last year’s stumbling
blocks. Its m ain points: (1) the
President could propose plans for
consolidation, abolition and transfers
in the executive department, to
be rejected by congress within 60
days via a concurrent resolution;
(2) financial estimates of independent
federal boards and commissions
would reach the President via the
budget bureau, as is now the case
with other governmental departments;
(3) the President could appoint
six administrative assistants at
$10,000 a year. One important safeguard
is that such quazi-judicial
agencies as the civil service commission,
coast guard, federal communications
commission nnd interstate
commerce commission could
not be reorganized.
A gricu ltu re
Some 11,000,000 bales of surplus
U. S. cotton are piled up under government
loans ot about $500,000,000.
Though unhappy, cotton farmers
voted for continued production control
last December because they expected
more loans. With planting
time near and no substitute yet
found for the present loan system
(which cannot be continued economically
so long as huge governmentheld
surpluses fail to move), Secretary
of Agriculture Henry A Wallace
offered three suggestions to the
senate farm committee and ended
by urging adoption of the last:
(1) Continue the present loan plan,
provided American cotton can be
placed on the unhappily low world
market. One means of doing this is
through U. S. subsidy.
(2) Abandon the loan plan and
grant sufficiently large outright
benefit payments to maintain farm j
income. Mr. Wallace’s favorite
method here is probably the ill- j
regarded processing tax.
(3) Peg domestic prices and sell
surpluses abroad for whatever they
would bring, as under the much- I
debated “ cost-of-production” plan.
Though cost-of-production has never j
held favor with Mr. Wallace, the
impossibility of winning a return of |
processing taxes has presumably
forced a compromise. The few I
known facts of the two-price cotton |
plan are that present loan provi- I
sions would be retained to maintain j
domestic prices higher than the j
present level (about 8.3 cents per 1
pound), while government-owned j
cotton would be sold to exporters ;
for world distribution.
E u rope
Seldom has history found a conqueror
who would retire to let others
enjoy the sweet fruit of victory.
Since 1932 Gen. Francisco Franco
has grown in stature as Spain's man
of destiny, at first unknown outside
his native land but later an international
figure as head of the In surgent
rebellion. With the civil war
apparently ended, all Europe has
looked to Spain for some hint of
Generalissimo Franco's plans, discovering
that the impossible is apparently
true.
Best guesses hold that monarchy !
will return in the person of Don
Juan, third son of former King Alfonso
whose properties were restored
last fall. Popular, untouched
by the deadly haemophilia that
plagues many Bourbons, Prince i
Ju an would apparently rule with
Ramon Serrano Suner, Franco's
brother-in-law, who holds the best
chance of becoming premier. F ran co
himself would retire to head the
army.
But what appears an overgenerous
gesture on Franco's part m ay be
dictated by Rome. An Italian resident
for several years, 25-year-old
Don Ju a n would not only bow to
Fascist wishes but would pacify hostile
Spaniards as General Franco
never could. Moreover such a puppet
would be less apt to offer Britain

Thus the Spanish solution fits perfectly
into Italo-German anti-democracy
plans, to be climaxed when
Rome pushes Mediterranean territorial

Most astute piece of diplomatic
maneuvering in recent weeks was
the Polish junket of Count Galeaz

While Count Ciano did his best tr

was sped and three new decree

small spoils beside the moral vie

and went busily ahead with

victory took place in Poland
even while Count Ciano was making

Count Ciano’s Friend Hitler. As

WASHINGTON — Harry L. Hopkins
tells a story about a herring
fisherman who had a great deal of
trouble keeping his fish alive in his
tanks, and finally hit on the device
of putting a catfish in each tank.
The catfish, Hopkins says, kept
things so stirred up that the herring
did not succumb to ennui or whatever
was the trouble before.
The story is apropos now because
it is being used as an explanation
of why President Roosevelt appointed
Thomas R . Amlie to the interstate
commerce commission, an appointment
generally regarded as one
of the poorest, from the standpoint
of practical politics, entirely aside
from any m erit or demerit it may
have, that Mr. Roosevelt has ever
made.
It is pointed out by those telling
the story that the President has long
been bitter about the independent
commissions. He does not approve
of these bodies which are not “ integrated”
with the administration—
or, in short, those which the adm inistration
cannot control.
There is nothing new about Mr.
Roosevelt’s feeling in this particular.
He did not like the federal
trade commission, and “ threw a catfish”
into that body after removing—
illegally, as the Supreme court later
held—W illiam E. Humphrey. The
catfish thrown into the Supreme
court was Justice Hugo L. Black.
Frank R. McNinch has been the catfish
for two bodies, the federal power
commission and the com m unications
commission.
Marriner S. Eccles has been a
particularly effective catfish. He not
only has kept the federal reserve
board stirred up but has tangled
with various other government units.
Public Defeat for the
President Almost Certnin
It is understood on Capitol H ill to
have been Aubrey W. Williams, late
lieutenant of H arry Hopkins in WPA,
and now head of the youth adm inistration,
who originated the Amlie
idea, which has proved as much of
a catfish for the United States senate
as the Supreme court enlargem
ent proposal did, though with apparently
almost as great a certainty
of accomplishing a public defeat for
the President.
Roosevelt began his practice of
tossing a catfish in every tank he
could before he began his aggressive
fight to “ co-ordinate” these independent
agencies. In the government
reorganization bill as he originally
planned it, it was proposed
that most of them be “ co-ordinated”
by the simple process of putting
them under the White House.
The President made no secret of
his ideas in this connection. What
on Capitol H ill and in certain other
quarters was regarded as a move
which would so tremendously increase
the powers of the Chief Executive
as to be a step toward dictatorship,
Roosevelt himself saw as
a move toward reform and efficiency.
He talked about his ideas in
press conferences long before his
bill was sent to the Capitol. In fact,
he talked so persuasively, and so
many sympathetic articles were
written about the efficiency of his
ideas, that later he had to begin
soft pedalling on this angle.
Difficulties Face Harter
Agreement With Germany
Talk of barter with Germ any, prim
arily to move such agricultural
products as cotton and lard into the
“ vacuum ” which exists in G e rm any,
brings up the essential objections
that the men working under
Secretary of State Cordell Hull on
the reciprocal trade agreements
have to face. They are the same
objections which resulted in George
N. Peek being thrown out of the administration
in the early days of
the trade agreements, though with
variations.
For example, the first objection
to barter with Germany is that the
particular trades proposed were not
barter at all. They involved payment
for American raw materials in
a special type of German marks,
which could be spent only inside
Germany. Acceptance of them of
course made impossible any threeway
type of trade.
The latest proposal does not contemplate
the use of these special
marks, but the acceptance of Germ
an products, mostly steel, wire,
etc., in exchange for the cotton and
lard which con^plicate America's agricultural
problem. Of course the
steel and wire industry does not
like this idea at all. For every
pound of German steel and wire im ported
as a result of this proposed
barter agreement, obviously, there
will be just one less pound of steel
or wire fabricated inside the United
States.
It is the same sort of thing whic!
makes any barter agreement so dif
ficult, which makes any reciprocal
trade agreement run into »o many
domestic objections, and which
made the Chinese-wall type of tariff
so easy in the old days.
Everybody is for exports. Nobody
is for imports—that is nobody
except Mr. Ultim ate Consumer, who
is never organized and therefore
does not have much influence with
congress or the government.
There Must Be Imports if
There Are to Be Exports
In fact, the chief difference between
the old tariff system and the
new reciprocal trade policy is that,
for the first time in American history,
there is actually somebody d irecting
the policy with respect to
imports who realizes that there
must be imports if there are also to
be exports. Somebody, in brief, who
is charged with the responsibility of
encouraging imports in order to provide
for exports, instead of merely
throttling imports, as the old-time
tariff bills did, with merely wishful
thinking as to exports.
The chief objection to straighten
out barter agreements by H ull’s lieutenants
is that in effect this takes international
trade out of private
hands and makes it a government
matter. Also it takes the movement
of goods out of the established
channels of trade.
The government agent anxious to
swap cotton for something, in order
to get rid of a cotton surplus, is not
going to worry too much about
whether the kind of barbed wire he
accepts in its place is the sort that
the farmers of this country really
want. If he happens to get the right
kind, he not only displaces workers
in American wire plants but he is
compelled to get the wire to the
farmers in some new way, which
plays havoc with the merchants who
formerly supplied the farmers.
But the chief objection the trade
experts have to barter is more fundamental.
Every time there is a
barter agreement, anywhere in the
world, it tends to restrict free trade
all over the world.
Rumor Morgenthau ff ill
Resign Bobs Up Again
The little boy who cried “Wolf,
wolf,” when there was no wolf has
nothing on the rumor that Henry
Morgenthau J r . will resign as secretary
of the treasury. The first
rumor of Morgenthau’s resignation
came within a few months after he
had succeeded W illiam H. Woodin
at the head of the treasury department.
It has been bobbing up ever
since, on the average of not less
than once every two months.
So when the real time comes probably
no one will believe the warning.
But there are actual reasons
this time for believing that Morgenthau
is on the verge of resignation,
and for two perfectly understandable
reasons.
Well-informed sources say that the
President and Morgenthau have
finally reached just about the breaking
point on the chief issue on which
they have so consistently differed.
It can be summed up in the words
“ balanced budget.” But it includes
much more than just spending more
than the government’s income year
after year. It takes in also the continual
movement of the President
toward the left, whereas Morgenthau
has clung to the original conservative
views he entertained when
he came to Washington,
j When Morgenthau became secre-
| tary of the treasury he was perfectly
willing to follow instructions because
he realized that he did not
know very much about Treasury
problems. By dint of hard work and
long hours, however, he has learned
a great deal about public finances.
The more he has learned the more
outspoken he has become in his advocacy
of his original conservative
viewpoint.
This does not mean that Mr. Morgenthau
has at any time been disloyal
to the President. On the contrary
there is scarcely a m an in the
administration who has been so
steadfastly devoted to every whim
and wish of the President.
But inside the cabinet he has
fought for his own ideas, on the
budget, on spending, or harassing
business, etc.
Secretary Worried Over
Plan for More Spending
Right now the same old battle
is being waged again with the group
which advocates more spending and
which worries not at all about the
mounting size of the federal debt,
headed by Marriner S. Eccles of the
federal reserve board. Morgenthau
is said by friends to be more disturbed
than ever before on this particular
issue.
First, the secretary is much surer
that he is right now than he ever
was before. Second, he has always
yielded before because the argument
was made that the need for
letting spending run above receipts
was only temporary—that with the
passage of time the spending could
be reduced, as private employment
increased, and that actually the
budget could be balanced.
Now Morgenthau believes that
such an objective will never be attained
so long as the present advice
the President is being given from
the other cam p is heeded—that the
men who want more spending and
more pump priming now will also
want it next year, almost regard
less of any conceivable set of events
in the meantime, and that they wil i
want it the following year, and thc
year after that.

C H A P T E R V I—Cuulinued

That was something. Rex carried
into his bedroom the warm ing conviction
that at least it was not his
hostess who wanted to frighten him
away from Halcyon C amp. This did
not take h im far on his mental journey,
for he had never thought that
it was. He undressed rapidly and
got into bed. He was glad to be
there. He was not wholly over his
earlier experience, notwithstanding
his gallant assertions. The evening
h ad been a hard one. He fell asleep
about one o'clock.
He was awakened almost im m e diately,
it seemed to h im , by a
h and that clutched his arm and a
voice that babbled incoherently at
his bedside. He sat up with a jerk,
and simultaneously flashed on the
light at the head of his bed. Down
in the hall the big clock was striking
three— Halcyon Camp's pet hour
for nocturnal visits. He had slept
only two hours, but he was already
as wide-awake as he had ever been
in his life. His instant thought had
been of Joan. It was Herbert Kneeland,
however, who mouthed and
jabbered at his bedside.
"H ale—for God's sakes—wake up.
H ale! H a le !”
"Good Lord, m an, I am awake.
W h at’s the matter? Anyone sick?
H u rt? ”
As he spoke Hale shook off the
clutching hand, sprang out of bed,
ceized his dressing-gown from the
ch a ir where he had flung it. and
•lipped it over his p ajamas. So distraught
was his visitor that Hale
had to break away almost by force
from the other’s frantic grasp. He
now seized the young m a n ’s shoulders,
pressed him backward into a
chair, and stood over him . still
gripping him nnd trying to steady
h im by eyes and hands.
"Kneeland, pull yourself together.
Tell me w hat’s happened. Quick.
Every second may count.”
"Nothing has happened!" Kneeland
pulled away from the other's
grip, and added with the gulp of a
terror-stricken child, " I —I ---just
c a n 't stand it. That's all. Oh, G o d !”
Hale crossed the room to the open
door, closed it, and locked it. He
remembered now that he had forgotten
to lock it when he went to
bed
"N o w ," he said quietly, "te ll me
what th it is all about. I think I
understand it, but tell me, anyway.”
Kneeland's head had been swinging
from side to side. Now it steadi
«d suddenly. He stared at Hale
incredulously but with a dawning
hope.
“ You — you understand?" he
gasped. He added, under his breath
and with a desperate backward
glance at the closed door, "W h at
do you understand?”
Rex answered the look, not the
word,.
"D o n ’t worry," he soothed. “ The
door ia locked. We won't be interrupted.
Quiet down now and exp
lain.” He added gently, but with
deep meaning. "H e can't get in.”
Kneeland drew a quick breath and
covered his eyes with his hands.
"W h a t m ust you think of m e ?”
he muttered.
" I think you’re the victim of one
of the most hellish schemes that
was ever tried on a poor devil,"
H ale said simply. "W h a t I can’t
understand is why you've let it go
on so long.”
"How could I help m yself?”
"There are a dozen ways in which
you could have helped yourself.
You're helping yourself now by
coming to me and letting me
atraighten out this tangle. Why
d id n 't you go to someone long ag o ?"
“ Who could I go to? Who would
have understood and believed? You
aee—you weren't here. And he—
he’s so infernally clever!”
“ I kn ow !” Hale spoke with difficulty.
The unconscious pathos of
that one sentence, "you see, you
weren't here" had caught him by
the throat.
"W e ll, it’s over now,” he said
cheerfully. “ Wa must—"
He was interrupted by a sharp
rap at the door. Kneeland straightened
as if under a galvanic shock,
then cried out frantically.
"D o n ’t let him in, Hale! Oh, Hale,
for God's sake, don't let him in.”
"W e ’ll let h im in, all right.” Hale
said grimly. " I ’ve got something
im portant to snv to that gentleman.
But I promise >ou that I'll keep you
with me tonight. And this is the
last time you will ever have to see
h im .”
He «tarted to rise but Kneeland
sprani! at h im , caught his arms
and tried to hold him back. He was
like a m adm a n in his terror, but
he had little strength. Rex disengaged
himself without difficulty and
pushed the young m an back into
his chair.
"B e quiet,” he said. “ You haven’t
got a thing to be afraid of. But
we must have a show-down, and
this is the best tim e for it. Sit
tight and leave everything to me.
I understand the whole devilish tituation.”
A knock struck the door again. It
was sharply imperative. Kneeland
waa amos’, beyond reason. He waa
in a frenzy of an im a l fear. Rex
got h im down on the chair and went
to the door. He opened it, and Doctor
Craig strode in. The doctor
was cool and imperturbable. He
nodded to Hale, then glanced at
Kneeland. The young m an cowered
back against his chair with a
groan, as if the glance had been a
blow. Craig's tone was quietly
friendly.
“I see m y patient is here,” he
said. " I thought he would be. He
has taken quite a fancy to you. I
hope he hasn’t disturbed you. He's
been in a bad way the last few days.
I ’ll take h im along now.”
“No, Craig, you won’t take him
alo ng ," Hale told h im . “ He's going
to stay right here. By the
tim e he’s up tomorrow m o rning ,"
he added incisively, "y ou will be
out of the house for good. Is that
quite c le a r?"
" I t ’s quite clear that you’re m aking
a fool of yourself again, H ale ,"
C raig said m ildly. “ You m ean well,
but this is another situation you
don't understand. I hoped the other
break you made would be a lesson
to you.”
“ I understand your whole dam nable
scheme,” Hale brought out curtly.
“ I f you think I don’t, sit down
and make yourself comfortable and
“ I f incidentally, you really drove
the boy m ad while you had h im
there,” he went on, “ it would have
been just too bad. Probably that
wasn't part of your scheme. Your
plan was to give h im just enough
treatment to keep h im about where
he is now—terrorized, desperately
afraid of you, and yet trusting you
as his only anchor. He was your
best friend. He has always been.
He has kept you here. He has fitted
up a laboratory for you that
any m an in your position would be
proud of. What was your return
for a ll this? You have put h im
through hell. Compared to what
you were doing to h im , plain m u rder
would have been a m erciful
thing. When I think of what you
have made h im suffer, I could strangle
you with m y bare hands.”
“ You fo o l!" Craig was choking
with fury. “ I ’ll make you regret
this.”
Hale ignored the interruption.
"A nd all the tim e, Doctor C raig ”
(he emphasized the title with such
bitter irony that Craig whitened under
the word), you knew that he
was in no more danger of insanity
than you are or I am. You knew
that his mother suffered from puerperal
insanity, which is due to complications
in childbirth and is not

"The answer to both your questions is yes. Sit down."
I*U prove it. W ill you have a cigarette?”
He picked up the box and
offered it.
Craig looked at h im . I t was a
long, straight look.
“ Are you authorized to act for
Mr. Kneeland?” he asked at last.
“ Yes, Craig, I am . Sit down and
I ’ll tell you why.”
Craig still ignored the invitation.
'•Are you taking m y patient out
of m y hands?” he asked with the
same calmness.
‘‘The answer to both your questions
is yes. Sit down.”
Craig sat down near the smoking
table, his back to the door. Hale
drew a chair forward and sat down
facing him . At their left Kneeland
cowered like a terrified anim al.
Again Craig gave Hale a long,
thoughtful look, but he did not
speak. Rex went on.
‘‘I ’ve been going into your case,
C raig ,” Hale said slowly, “ ever
since I got here. You aren’t really
very clever. If most of the people
around you hadn’t been either selfobsessed
or as bad as you are
yourself, you would have been discovered
and kicked out as soon as
you began to develop your little
scheme. I t ’s a very elemental
scheme. If you had been more patient
and intelligent you m ight have
carried it out. But you were in too
much of a hurry, especially after I
got here. You wanted to get to
Vienna and study. You wanted a
steady income there while you were
doing your work. Last year it occurred
to you that by convincing
your best friend, who has plenty
of money or can get it in an emergency,
that he was inheriting his
mother’s insanity, and in sending
him off his head by constant and
hellish suggestions, you could get
him to go with you to Vienna, supposedly
for treatment there.”
He paused a moment, then went
on. ‘‘It was a very pretty plan,
from your viewpoint. You let Bert
infer that you alone could save
him from a madhouse. You had a
patient very susceptible to suggeshereditary.
Bert Kneeland was nervously
run down, but he was in no
more danger of insanity than you
are.”
A choking gasp came from behind
them. Kneeland had straightened
up. He was stammering out
almost incoherent words.
“ H ale! Is that straight? Are you
certain of that? God in heaven!”
Hale turned and looked at h im .
“ I ’m certain of it,” he said quietly.
“ You could have been certain
of it, if you had the initiative to
go to any honest physician and ask.
Doctor Nick Crosby, who is only two
miles away, and who attended your
mother till she died, would have
told you that you had nothing to
fear. He told me that. So did two
psychiatrists I have consulted. Any
honest physician would have burst
C raig’s infernal bubble for you.”
“ I ’ve let you run on, you fool,”
Craig said with white fury. “ I ’ve
given you enough rope to hang yourself
with, and you’re doing it.”
“ Shut up.” Hale’s fire had died
down. He spoke wearily. “ I t ’s my
turn to talk now, and yours to listen.
You’ve been averaging five or six
him to sail with you the middle of
Ju ly . You told h im he was in very
bad shape. You scared him out of
his remaining wits. You were pretty
stupid about him after you got
frightened. You might have had a
m ad m an on your hands in a few
weeks more. And all the time you
thought you were so clever! E n couraging
h im one day, and casting
h im into the depths of despair
the next day. A chap with less pluck
than Kneeland would have smashed
under it weeks ago. But he’s young
and strong. H e’ll soon be himself
again.”
He turned to Kneeland. The young
m an had stopped trembling. He
drew his chair close to Hale, but as
far from Craig as the circle would
permit, and sat down.
“ So you’re a psychiatrist, too?”
Craig sneered.
His face was livid, his voice e
hiss. Again he looked as venomous
as the cobra he had suggested in
the upper hall that noon.
“ No, I ’m not a psychiatrist,” Hale
acknowledged placidly. “ But I got
some expert advice about this case.
I ’ve talked to your superiors in New
York, Craig. I ’ve a letter in my
pocket from Doctor Marcel Michel,
of Paris, a friend of mine. I fancy
you know him by reputation.”
“ W hat?” Craig was out of his
chair now. “ You’ve been slandering
me to my associates, you interfering
hound? There’s a penalty for
slander, and you’ll pay it.”
“ Not until the Grievance C om m ittee
of the New York County Medical
Society has acted on your case,”
Hale said gently. "A n d certainly
not after your license to practice
medicine has been revoked.”
He watched Craig sink back in
his chair after that blow, and went
on conversationally.
“ We’ve a very strong case against
you, Doctor.” Again he underlined
the word. “ A statement signed by
Mr. Kneeland, by Bert himself, by
Miss Joan Kneeland, by Mrs. Wilbur
Nash, by me. and even by Ainsworth,
would interest the New York
County Medical Society very
m uch.”
Craig stood up.
“ Bert Kneeland is off his head,”
he said slowly. "So are you. But
there’s a limit to what a doctor
can be expected to endure from his
patients and their fool friends. I
shall take the lirst tram from here
in the morning.”
“ Good,” Hole said heartily. “ Now
I ’ll tell you what else you’re going
to do. Wait a minute,” he ordered,
as Craig started for the door. “ This
is important.”
Craig waited, his hand on the
door-knob.

days of the Territory of Illinois.
Many times Mme. La Compt
was awakened in the dead of night
by In dian friends who urged her to
seek safety in St. Louis. But, instead
of fleeing. Mme. La Compt invariably
set out alone to meet the
hostiles and dissuade them from
their purpose. Sometimes she
stayed with them for days before
she succeeded. More than once the
fearful villagers of Cahokia, armed
and ready for an attack, saw a
strange procession coming out of [
the woods—a band of warriors with j
their war-paint freshly washed
away and humbly obeying the orders
given them by the tall white ,
woman marching ahead of them!
After rearing a large fam ily of
children, Mme. La Compt was widowed
again. Again she was mar- |
ried, this time to an American
named Tom Brady. She outlived ,
him for 30 years and died in Ca- ]

A Monument to Failure

orado, is not only a memorial
to its first American discoverer, 1
M aj. Stephen H. Long, of the En- j
gineers Corps of the United States '
army, but it is also a monument to
a great failure.
In 1819 the United States government
was preparing to send a great I
arm y into the Upper Missouri country
to establish a military post to
protect and extend the fur trade.
The expedition was also expected to
add to the scientific knowledge of i
the West and Major Long was directed
to take with him a group of
scientists for this purpose.
With a small and inadequately
supplied force, he crossed the plains ;
to the base of the Rockies and spent
some time exploring that region.
When he returned he made a re- j
port that was destined to become
: famous for its inaccuracies. “ In re- j
gard to this extensive section of
I the country,” he wrote, “ we do not j
hesitate in giving our opinion that
it is almost wholly unfit for cultiva- j
tion, and of course uninhabitable by
a people depending upon agriculture
for their subsistence.”
More than any other man, per-
I haps, he was responsible 'or fixing
upon the maps of the United States
of that tim e the words “ The Great
American Desert” and those words
retarded development of that country

Connection Between Good Memory and
Vitamins Demonstrated by Scientists
A connection between good m em ory
and an adequate supply of vitam
ins is demonstrated in experiments
carried on at the University
of Colorado by Dr. Charles F. Poe,
professor of chemistry, and Dr. Karl
F. Muenzingei, associate professor
of psychology.
Their experiments were made on
rats, using three groups, one group
kept on a normal diet, one kept on
a diet deficient in vitam in G and one
deficient in the vitam in B complex.
All were given an opportunity to
learn to solve a maze problem at
the age of seven weeks. Three
months later they were put back on
tion. You could have kept him in the maze and data was collected on
Vienna a year or two. You could
have convinced him that you were
keeping h im out of an asylum. You
could have handled the purse
strings, and you could have taken
damned good care that he never
saw another psychiatrist while he
was there. You would have sent reassuring
reports to his anxious father.
In one way or another you

The rats lacking vitam in B made
a very poor showing compared to
the other two groups. The group on
a normal diet re-learned the maze in
an average time of 650 seconds; the
vitam in G deficient group in 707 seconds,
while the B deficient group required

and the G deficient group in

Vitamin B is known as the antineuritic
vitamin because its lack
causes nervous disorders. It is found
naturally in whole grain cereals, tomatoes,
beans and yeast. Soluble
in water, it can be lost from foods
if the water they are cooked in is
discarded.
Life of Alexander Hamilton
Alexander H amilton, born Ja n u ary

of twelve and came to America

1 ing to school in Ohio when the Civil
war broke out. She immediately
! asked for passage through the Union
lines to Tennessee and was refused.
I So, when the Union flag was flrst
I raised on the school grounds, she
shot every star out of it, one by one.
The results were immediate and
i most favorable—she was expelled
I from school and sent home to Memt
phis, which was just exactly what
she wanted.
She was not only a good marksj
woman—she was pretty and selfconfident.
Her beauty and other
charms enabled her to become en-
! gaged to 16 young Confederate army
j recruits, all at the same time. This
I wasn't very honest, she admitted
| years later, but it made the young
| soldiers feel good and d id n’t make
her feel bad.

displeasure over his fraternizing
with President Cardenas of Mexico,
and business representation at his

crowd of cheering workers that
“ if capital does not wish to respect
the desires and rights of the people,
the resulting confusion will work
against its own aspirations.”
This is one of several recent

wide swing to the right. Soon

I ’niversity Budget
University of Wisconsin President;
C. A. Dvkstra told the joint committee
on finance that the university could
not be operated under the budget proposed
by Governor Heil unless teacher’s
salaries are cut.
Governor Heil has recommended
that the University receive a million
dollar cut from the amount with which
it operated during the present biennium
ending June 30. President Dykstra
pointed out that this would return
the university budget to approximately
that which it operated under
during 1922, despite the fact that enrollment
in 1922 was 8,000 and this
year is 12,000 and will perhaps be
13,000 by 1940.
Asked about the possibility of raising
student fees, the university president
explained that W'isconsin fees at
$34 are lower than those charged by
state universities in adjoining: states.
He said that he would never recommend
an increase in fees because that j Routine business and the hearing
would mean that “we would provide and adopting of various reports of

In an editorial appearing in the

ago, the writer says that he is happy
t > know that W’ isconsin is not among
the eleven states of the Union that
have bills pending in their respective
legislatures to legalize slot machines.
It is a cruel, heartless thing to do,
hut we are disposed to put an end to
his happiness by informing him that
xuch a bill is actually on the legislative
calendar in Madison. It was introduced
by Assemblyman Melvin
Schlytter of this village several weeks
ago. The Record-Herald writer no
doubt missed the news of that fact at j
the time, and also the editorial discus-1
sion given it in The Milwaukee Journal j
and other dailies.

Wisconsin Leads in the
Cooperative Movement
(By County Agent Baumeister.)
What state is outstanding for its
cooperatives ?
What state has a tenth of all the
cooperative association# in the United
States? W’hat state has more farmer
members in cooperative business organisations
than it has farm operators?
The answer is— Wisconsin.
These interesting facts were
brought out in a recent radio talk,
“Cooperation— Fact or fancy?” by
Asher Hobson, head of the Dept, of
Agricultural Economics at the University
of W’isconsin over state stations
W’HA-WLBL. He accounts for Wisconsin
having more cooperative members
than there are farmers by explaining
that many farmers belong to
more than one cooperative.
Wisconsin* lead in the cooperative
movement Hobson attributed to the
fact that dairy products lend themselves
so well to processing and marketing.
Between one-third and onefourth
of all cooperatives among
farmers in the United States has to
do w’ith dairy products. It is estim-
I a ted that one-third of all butter is
made by cooperatives. Something like
one-fifth of the cheese of the United
States is made and marketed cooperatively.
After dairying, in order of their cooperative
importance, come grain and
I livestock, fruit and vegetables are
fourth, and these four groups account
for three-fourths of the farmer’s cooperative
buying and selling business.
Hobson estimated that thirty percent
of the products sold from Wisconsin
farms passed through the hands of a
cooperation in some state of its journey
from the farmer to the retailer.
Other important facts reported were
that W'isconsin has nearly 1,100 cooperative
associations with more than
215,000 members, and that these cooperatives
do an annual business of
$95,000,000, which is, roughly speaking,
one-twentieth of the total farmer
cooperative business in the United!
States.
local support and not to be substituted
for it and does not include special or
school libraries.
In Wisconsin the per capita average
expenditure is 44 cents while the minimum
ipcomt upon which libraries can
maintain adequate service as recom-!
mended by the American Library Association
is $1. Actually Wisconsin’s
expenditure for public libraries is i
more than 50 per cent below standard.

Val Meckes, Treasurer, j
fhe rising tide of farm caah from milk has added nearly $.140.000 900 tc

farmers the highest price, probabh
would have suffered greater con
sumption declines but for deter

"Cash income from milk is also
important as it is chiefly cash paid
monthly to farmers,” the Founda
tion points out. “and this is cash
that is used in the current pur
chases of merchandise and sup
plies.
“The milk industry is a huge

PRO P O SE A ID FOR L1BRAR1KS
To develop, improve and equalize
library opportunities between town
and country and sections that vary in
ability to support public library service,
the Wiscorsin Library Associaation
is proposing State Aid for public
libraries.
A bill has been introduced, asking
the 1939 state legislature for an annual
appropriation of $950,000 to carry
out this work.
According to thc proposed bill, 25
per cent of this appropriation would
form an equalization library fund to
be used to aid in establishing libraries
in areas where none exist and in building*
up public libraries to meet the
standards established by the Free
Library Commission.
The remainder of the appropriation
would go into the general library fund
which would be apportioned on a per
capita basis among the qualifying
public libraries of the state.
The bill is intended to supplement

to flee for their lives.”

tribute to Christianity and the beauty,
kindness and courage it represents.
The mad emperor, Nero, sixth and

all Christians, or even those suspected
of the “ Fatal Sin” of Christianity,
were to be executed in various interesting
and diverting ways, chiefly by
being fed to the lions in the blooddrenched
arena of the circus Maximus.

Greatest Danger to Liberty
“ I f ignorance and passion are the
foes of popular morality, it must be
confessed that moral indifference is
the malady of the cultivated classes.
The modern separation of enlightenment
and virtue, of thought and conscience,
of the intellectual aristocracy
from the honest and common crowd is
the greatest dange»r that can threaten
liberty.”—Henri-Frederic Amiel, 1821-

“ T / i e B o m b i n t h e B o x c a r ”
H e l l o , e v e r y b o d y :
You know, sometimes there’s a lot of difference between
what people may think of a man and what he thinks of himself.
In the case of John Feen of Miami, Okla., for instance, there
are people who think he is a hero. During the war, his officers
were all for recommending John for decoration, because they
thought a certain brave act of John’s deserved a medal if any
act of heroism ever did.
But that’s what the other folks think of it. Just between us,
i John doesn’t share their views at all. In John’s own estimation
he’s just a doggone careless sap, and whatever happened
was his own fault in the first place. And he deserved to be shot
a heck of a lot more than he deserved a medal.
That’s what John thinks about it. He swears that what he did
wasn’t heroism at all. Well—you can decide that for yourself.
[ But there’s one thing I ’m certain of. It may or it may not have
been heroism—but it sure was adventure!
Now let's take this yarn to Siberia and tag along with that little
bunch of American soldiers who stayed over there after the war to
clean up some of the tag ends of the Big Unpleasantness. Two battallions
of the Twenty-seventh infantry were quartered at Berosovka,
; trying to keep a bit of order in a land where both law and order had
broken down. The bandit leader, Seminoff, with a large band of Cossacks.
was plundering and looting and m urdering in the region, using
an armored railroad train as a base of operations. And on Janu ary 5,
1920, word came that he was headed toward Berosovka.
As He Leaned Forward There Was a Sharp, Ominous Click.
Both battalions were ordered to the field, and John Feen was in
that gang, carrying a rifle and a knapsack full of hand grenades. I'd
like to tell you more about that scrap with SeminoH's Cossacks, but
that's an adventure story all in itself. A ll I can tell you here is that the
Yanks waited for Seminoff's armored train, blew up the track in front
of it, and bombed and fought their way into the cars. On the last
charge, John took what few grenades he had left out of his knapsack

Honors for greatest age among
living things are re-awarded to the
big trees of western America in a
sum m ary study by the late Dr.
Hans Molisch.
The big trees’ only close competitor
for record length of life, in Dr.
Mollsch’s tabulation, is the baobab
tree of Africa which is given an es
tim ated ace of 5.000 years.
Next in line come the banyan ol
Ir.dia. sacred for having sheltered
the Buddha The identical tree un
der which G u atam a sat when in
spiration came to him is still
pointed out. and since it has been a
holy place during all the centuries
it is quite probable that the tradition
is accurate, so that the estimated
3.000-year age of the "bo-tree" if
well supported.
Not so well fares the giant cy
press of fu le . in Mexico, at which
stout Cortez marvelled.
He leaped forward and dropped on the pile of coats.
and stuffed them in his pockets. Then the fighting was over and the
Americans were climbing into the tiny box cars of a troop train th%t
had come out from Berosovka to get them.
In the car John was in. the boys built a fire in the tin stove,
peeled off their sheepskin coats and threw them in a pile on the
floor. Then they flopped on the floor and tried to get a little sleep.
The flre blazed up, and tbe little car became unbearably hot.
The coats were close to the stove, and John was afraid they’d be
scorched. He got op to move them . As he leaned over and
slipped his arm under the pile there was a sharp, ominous crack,
and instantly, every one of those tired men leaped to his feet.
They knew all too well what that sound was— a grenade, getting
ready to explode. Someone had left that grenade in bis coat
pocket, and John, in picking up those coats, had accidentally
dislodged the pin!
•’Faces,” says John, ‘‘became wax-like as men asked themselves
whose coat it was, and how fa r down in the pile the bomb lay. We
were all praying it was on the bottom where the whole pile of coats would
cover it. Then maybe some of us m igh t have a chance. If it wasn't—
if it blew up high-wide and handsome in the crowded quarters of that
little car—the slaughter would be appalling.
"The swaying boxcar seemed to creak the fatal words, 'Ten
seconds to live . . . ten seconds to live.' Ten seconds more—
then nine—then eight. The deep rumble o( the wheels on the
tracks below sounded like muffled drum s and the wind outside
howled a mournful 'Litany of the Dead.' The tiny candle that
lit the car flickered spasmodically for a moment and died. The
gloom closed in—and still we w a ited."
Up to that time everyone had been too stunned to move. A crowd
of tight-lipped doughboys stood motionless, waiting for death. John
Feen was the first one to recover his senses. He screamed to that
bunch of men to lie down—and that broke the spell. A dozen heavy
bodies thudded to the floor. One m an swore aloud. Another sobbed
and a third muttered a woman's name. But John was still on his feet.
He was standing right over that bomb, and for a brief second his lips
moved. He was praying.
John's Itody Protects Others From Gremide Blast.
But it was only for a moment. There was hardly any time for
prayer. Three or four seconds more and that bomb would be going
off. And he had a job to do before that happened. The prayer had hardly
left his Ups when he leaped forward—dropped on that pile of coats his
arm s hugging them to him like a hen mothering her brood. That
deadly engine of destruction buried somewhere in that pile of coats
m igh t blow him to bits, but the other fellows in the car would have
a chance
One second— two seconds— and then there was a roar that
sounded to John as if it had come from the bowels of Hell itself.
Bright scarlet flashes streaked the interior of the car. He felt
the pile of coats heave beneath h im —and then John just doesn't
remember any more.
The first thing he remembers after that was that someone was lifting
him . He heard someone else talking, and the words sounded faint, and
far away, and hollow as if the man who was speaking them was talking
into a barrel. Slowly, consciousness cam e back to him . He opened
his eyes. He remembered now—that bomb! Anxiously he counted the
white faces that were bent over him They were all there, those buddies
of his. He sighed in relief—and fainted.
John woke up in thr hospital at Berosovka—a bit surprised
to find that hr was still alive. He probably wouldn't have been
alive if that bomb hadn't been down at the bottom of the pile
of roats—thick sheepskin coats that stopped the flying bits of steel.
As it was, his arm was shattered and full of bits of corrugated
metal—and it would have to come off.
A few days later, while he was recuperating from the amputation
of that arm an officer came to his bedside and told him he was going
to be recommended for docoration—but John told that officer to lay off.
He didn't want any medals. He didn't think he deserved any. All he
had done was what he knew darned well it was his duty to do.
"Y o u see," he says, " i t was my coat pocket that held that g re nad e !"

C. Houston Goudiss Recommends Generous Use of
Eggs; Shows How This Protective Food
Helps to Balance the Diet
By C. HOUSTON GOUDISS
ANY experienced homemaker knows the many cookery
uses of eggs. Indeed, she is likely to feel that she could
not keep house without this indispensable ingredient, which
a French chef once described as “the cement that holds the
castles of cookery together.” It is true that we should have
to do without some of our most delectable dishes if eggs were
not available to use as thickening, leavening, coating, binder,
clarifier, stabilizer or garnish. ♦ — 1
But even more significant than
their contribution to good
Nice Lonesome

she enjoyed thoroughly. One day
when the whole family was going

said.
“ Well, it’ll be the kind ol nice

after a hearty dinner. “ I
certainly enjoyed that food. I ate
like a growing boy.”
“ You are growing,” grinned
grandpa, “ growing fatter every
day.”
cooking are their splendid nutritional
values.
A Notable Protective Food
Eggs rank next to m ilk in that
group of mineral—and vitaminrich
foods that we
call “ protective.”
They contain substances
that are
very efficient for
growth and development.
And in the
opinion of nutritionists,
they are
more nearly interchangeable
with
m ilk than any other
food.
Eggs are among
the first foods to be added to the
milk diet of infants. And homemakers
who desire to give their
families well-balanced meals
should provide an egg daily for
every individual.
This requirement can be reduced,
if necessary, to four eggs
weekly. But luckily, as we head
toward spring, eggs become more
plentiful, and lower in price. And
it is usually possible for every
family to obtain a full quota of
this splendid food . . . so rich in
the elements that help to build
muscle, bone and blood.
A Fine Body Builder
Eggs contain proteins of high
quality, and their proteins seem
to be particularly well adapted to
building body tissue. That is one
reason why this food is so desirable
in the child’s diet . . . so
useful in constructing the diet for
adults who need “ building up.”
It also makes eggs a logical
I choice as a m ain dish for Lenten
I meals.
I t ’s interesting to note that the
i proteins of the white and yolk of
I an egg are quite different in their
properties. Egg white is almost
pure protein and water, while the
protein of the yolk is composed
of a different assortment of amino
; acids, or building stones.
The yolk also contains fat . . .
j in a finely emulsified form, so that
I like m ilk fat, it is comparatively
1 easy to digest. And it is the yolk
which is highly prized for its
rich store of minerals and vitamins.
It is therefore considered
the most important part of the
egg for young children, and the
white is often withheld and only
, the grated yolk given.
Rich in Iron and Phosphorus
Eggs are notable as a source of
iron and phosphorus. Iron is
necessary for the formation of the
> hemoglobin or red pigment of the
blood, and the iron in eggs is
Make i i Worthwhile!
Father—No, son. If 1 give you a
quarter it would shrink at once
to a nickel.
Son—Then give me a dollar so It
will be a quarter by the time it get*
done shrinking.
Some Drouth
•'And how is youi husband getting

“ You’d be surprised—that battle-
| ship he had tattooed on hia chest
j is now only a rowboat.”
valuable for this purpose. Phosphorus
is the mineral that pairs
with calcium in building teeth and
bones. It also plays an important
part in regulating the neutrality
of the blood. The phosphorus in
eggs occurs in a form that is par
ticularly well adapted to the needs
of the growing body.
Four Important Vitamins
As our knowledge of vitamins
has increased, nutritionists have
urged that eggs be accorded a
wider place in the diet, for they
supply four of these vital factors—
vitamins A. B, D and G. They
are an important source of vitam
in A, which promotes growth
and helps build resistance to disease.
The appetite-promoting vitam
in B occurs in lesser amounts
than A, but its presence helps to
increase the quantity of this essential
substance included in the
daily diet.
Eggs are one of the few foods
naturally containing vitam in D,
sometimes called the sunshine vitam
in. And it has been determined
that they are rich in vitam
in G, which is required for
health and vitality at all ages.
Raw Eggs vs. Cooked
Eggs are one of the foods that
digest most satisfactorily, about
97 to 98 per cent of their protein
being digested and absorbed.
Moreover, the thoroughness of digestion
does not seem to be af
fected by the method of cooking,
and a hard-cooked egg, when well
masticated, is as completely digested
as one that is soft-cooked.
Raw egg white on the other hand
is not as completely utilized as
when slightly cooked. This show's
the fallacy of the old-fashioned
idea that raw eggs were more
desirable for invalids than cooked
eggs.
Brown Eggs vs. White
Some people have an idea that
the color of the shell has a bearing
upon the nutritive value of an
egg. In certain parts of the country.
homemakers will pay a prem
ium for eggs with white shells.
In other sections, brown eggs are
in greater demand, and therefore
sell at a higher price. There is
no justification for attaching any
importance to the color of the
shell.
Avoid "Same Old Thing”
Occasionally homemakers tell
me that some member of their
fam ily doesn’t like eggs. It is
true that some people have an allergy
to eggs, that is, they cannot |
eat them without having some abnormal
reaction. But more often,
any antipathy to eggs is due to
the fact that they have been
served in the same way, day in
and day out. There is no excuse
for that, for eggs are so versatile
that they m ay be served in dozen*
of different ways, and in some
dishes, their identity can be entirely
concealed.
“ Sunny side up” may be the
most popular method of preparing
eggs. But don't get into a menu
rut, whether you are serving them
for breakfast, dinner, lunch or
supper. Cook them soft. Cook
them hard. Transform them into
omelets and souffles. Scramble
them, plain, or dressed up with
cheese, diced bacon, frizzled dried
beef or sausages.
Eggs for Lenten Meal
As a m ain dish for a Lenten
meal, hard-cooked eggs may be
creamed and served alone, or
combined with cooked vegetables
or fresh or canned fish. Use them
as a binder in croquettes and loaf
mixtures, as a coating for deepfried
foods.
French toast is a simple luncheon
dish, combining the energy
values of bread with the fine nutritive
values of eggs. Hearty
luncheon salads or sandwiches
can be made by combining
chopped or sliced hard-cooked
eggs with fresh or cooked vegetables.
Since eggs admirably supplement
the food values of milk,
puddings made from milk and
eggs are an ideal dessert for children,
and help to balance the diet
of adults. Custard pies, fruit
whips and cakes are also delightful
dishes that bring to the diet
the protective values of eggs.

SHEBOYGAN. WIS.—Increases in
Wisconsin barley crops averaging
21 bushels per acre by the use of
fertilizer and gains averaging $12.60
per acre in the value of the yields
were recorded in a series of field
plot tests carried on in Sheboygan
county during the 1938 growing
season.
Twenty-seven farmers in Sheboygan
county cooperated with County
Agricultural Agent. Glenn W. Lycan,
in making the tests. The farms represented
a good standard of soil fertility.
In most cases, the test plots
consisted of one seed drill width
with fertilizer and another drill
width unfertilized.
The county agent’s office provided
a certified barley seed and a
fertilizer dealer cooperated in furnishing
an 0-20-10 fertilizer, which
was used at the rate of 175 pounds
per acre. A combination drill with
fertilizer attachment was utilized
on every plot, insuring a uniform
rate of planting.
A soil test was made of all the
fields before the application of fertilizer,
so that the results could be
measured against the natural fertility
of the soil.
At harvest time, comparable sections
of the fertilized and unfertilized
plots were cut and threshed
and yield comparisons were determined.
The barley yield on the 27 fertilized
plots averaged 70 bushels per
acre; the yield on the unfertilized
check plots averaged 49 bushels per
acre. The highest yield on a fertilized
plot was at the rate of 90
I bushels per acre and the lowest was
140. On the unfertilized plots, the
I highest yield was at the rate of 61
; bushels per acre and the lowest was
. 22 bushels per acre.
The fertilizer cost averaged $3.44
per plot. The increased value of
the crop due to the use of fertilizer
! was $12.60 per acre. Another result
: of the fertilizer was an increase of
: 750 pounds per acre in straw on the
fertilized plots.
| “Sheboygan county is one of the
most productive counties in the
state,” said Mr. Lycan. ‘ and has
carried on a system of farming
which included a large percentage
1 of the acreage in soil conserving
crops. The county has one of ihe
densest cow populations in the
United States. One of the purposes
! of the test was to determine whether
or not this type of farming had
maintained soil fertility and whether
the fertilizer would return a good
| profit.
• Farmers who cooperated in the
I test were impressed with the earlier
maturity of the fertilized portion of
the field as well as the uniform ripj
ening of the plot. But perhaps the
j most remarkable thing was the de-
; cided increase in yield.
“The acreage of barley in She-
Iboygan county has increased from
j 11,700 acres in 1929 to 28.000 acres
i in 1937. Uniform ripening, early
maturity, plump kernels and large
yields due to the use of fertilizer
have been important factors in the
development of a good quality bar-
! ley program.”

Isn’t It Time You Had a
JOHN D EERE TRACTOR?
It ’s not a long step from horse-farming
to power-farming with the John
Deere. Farm boys hardly old enough
to drive three horses operate this
tractor. And it doesn’t require a mechanic to keep
it in good running order. Vou can do it yourself,
right out on your farm.
The John Deere gives you everything you want
in a tractor for your heavy farm jobs—adaptability,
power, economy, light weight, simplicity, and accessibility.
It supplies drawbar, belt, and power takeoff
service to reduce your labor costs, to do your
wo'k when it should be done, to give you more time
for other duties or for recreation.
Investigate the John Deere fully. Ask any one
you know who owns one. Come in and let us show
you why the new model is better than ever.
