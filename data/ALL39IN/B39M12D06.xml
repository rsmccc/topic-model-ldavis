The Banner-Journal has been presented
with a few copies o f ancient
Jackson county papers by E R Prindle 
o f Alma They were found in
the course o f the reconstruction of
the kitchen o f his home where apparently
they had been reposed for
fifty years or more They are in fair
condition notwithstanding the weather
changes o f more than half a century 
and included in their columns
still intact are many most interesting
stories o f by-gone days when the
song o f the saw-log if there was such
a song was still heard in the land 
The copies include those o f the Badger
State Banner the Wisconsin Leader 
o f Merrillan and the Jackson
County Journal Some are o f 1895 
and others including the Journal o f
1886 the year in which the Journal
was established There was plenty o f
politics in each o f them and some
o f the editorials were sharp enough to
have been written with a meat-ax In
February the Leader quotes the market
price on farm products wheat at
70 to 78 eggs 16 to 18 hogs $4 to
$4 25 dressed o f course butter 16
to 18 etc The high cost o f living
was not so notable then The January
thaw came in February that year 
and the thermometers boomed from
40 below zero to 40 above within 48
hours Old local newspapers are al- j
ways full o f interesting reading for i
the generations which come on long j
after their date o f publication and
when laid away and preserved are always
bound to turn into reading
treasures in course o f time There
were not so many publications o f a
general nature in the long ago and
the local papers were the principal
source o f both local and distant news 
The papers brought in by Mr Prindle
were sent originally to A W Prindle
who was prominent in political as well
as other county affairs hence he was
a subscriber to all three papers There
was still another publication here the
Wisconsin Independent which continued
until 1895

How many people there are in
Jackson county who were bora within
its borders in the fifties we do not
know As Hie fifties went out
nearly eighty years ago those so
bom are among the older folks now 
and in another decade they may be in
the ranks o f old folks and have another
ten years to go in that class if
they can make it Fred Newell of
Hixton has not yet reached his fourscore
mark nor probably has A D 
Brown o f the same community but
an interesting item comes along that
they are the oldest o f those bom in
the town o f Hixton which was a
township before Civil war days Mr 
Newell was a deer hunter back in the
days o f the muzzle loading rifles He
long since relegated that to the relics 
and took on the modem devices which
have neither ram-rods nor cap cases 
He was among the hunting licensees
for the recent deer campaign and he
probably saw more hunters if not so
many deer as in the time o f the muzzle
loading rifle There may be others
in other towns who are the oldest
of those o f local birth We wish we
had a record o f them and along with
the records the many fine and interesting
stories which they might tell
o f the roaring and rollicking days o f
that long ago

We occasionally read of accidents
caused by birds striking a car and
wonder just how so much damage can
be done by so small an object Sunday
afternoon there was a striking example
o f it here F S Crawford o f
Duluth was driving south on highway
12 and somewhere near Augusta his
struck a partridge He was driving
about 55 or 60 miles an hour at the
time and the bird struck the windshield
in such a manner as to smash
through in spite of the fact that Mr 
Crawford had shatter-proof glass The
flying glass struck him on the lower
part o f his face cutting the end of
his nose and across his mouth and
chin The body o f the bird was even
more badly cut up Mr Crawford
went to the hospital here to have his
wounds dressed and stayed over night
to have his car fixed It was a painful 
unpleasant experience and Mr 
Crawford has no desire to get any
more partridges with a car for a
weapon It has repercussions

CO N SERVATIO N D EPARTM EN T
INFORM ATION
The Wisconsin Conservation department
has for some time been experimenting
with various species o f
upland game birds for stocking purposes 
The pheasant has proved to be a
welcome replacement o f the native
birds in the better agricultural areas
o f the state This season s pheasant
kill no doubt will crowd close to half
a million birds 
The Hungarian partridge also an
imported bird first stocked at Oconomowoc 
is now common in 20 o f the
counties in the southeastern portion
o f the state and continues to invade
areas to the North and West 
The native ruffed grouse or partridge
is a budder and nicely adapted
to those areas o f the state not suitable
as grounds for pheasants and
Huns but is subject to disease periodically 
The disease cycle makes
such inroads on the population o f this
species as to render it unstable consequently
the state is anxious to find
a disease resistant bird which will assure
the public o f an annual crop 
It is hoped that such a bird has been
found in the Chukar partridge 
The Chukar a hardy bird is slightly
smaller than the native grouse has
light marking on throat and under
side o f tail Its smooth appearing
plummage enables even the casual observer
to identify the bird without
difficulty 
Fifteen pair o f Chukars have been
released in the southeastern portion
o f Jackson county 
The Conservation Department wishes
to enlist the general public in the
protection o f this bird 
Brook Trout stocking as o f Nov 
13-39 four inch stock in Jackson
county were as follows 
Vismal C r e e k 9 200

RULES OF THE H IG H W AY
December always brings death to
many pedestrians the State Highway
commission warns While the last
three months o f the year are the most
dangerous for pedestrians December
had more pedestrian fatalities in 1936
and 1938 than any other month and
 was third high in 1937 
Pedestrians in Jackson county can
protect themselves from accidents by
observing two simple rules 
1 On rural highways walk on the
19eft side o f the road facing oncoming
cars Step off onto the shoulder
as cars approach At night carry a
lantern or a flashlight 
2 On streets cross only at the intersection 
Never jaywalk at the corner 
never cross in the middle o f the
block and never step out between
parked cars 
December also leads all months in
the number o f non-fatal pedestrian
accidents State Highway commission

two years then they spent a year in
Iowa In 1885 they purchased the
home in Upper Franklin where they
dwelt together for 53 years raising
a family and watching them find their
place in the world and becoming gray
in their own turn 
Old and full o f years Mrs Gilbertson

shall not forget them or their labors
on our behalf

Agriculture will each appear on the
program during the forenoon and afternoon
sessions Mr Briggs will discuss
chick brooding and feeding also
winter feeding o f the laying flock 
Both speakers are well known to the
farmers throughout the state therefore
their messages should be both interesting
and educational 
Local arrangements are being made
by Albert Dickey Agricultural Instructor
at Melrose High school 
Poultry Husbandry
Poultrymen who have or will have
electric line power services by next
spring will be interested in a new
type o f electric brooder which has
been designed by engineers at the
College o f Agriculture 
Three important considerations in
a brooder  cost safety and dependability 
are provided for in this
brooder Engineers say it can be
built at home for about ten dollars
and that it takes less current than
most brooders Low current consump
tion is credited to a 4-inch layer of
shavings used on top to keep the heat
from escaping 
An outstanding feature o f this
home made brooder is that it has controlled
circulation o f air and control
led ventilation which maintains very
even temperature throughout the
brooder The air is kept slowly circulating
by means o f a fan The air
is driven up from the floor over the
heating element and back to the floor
again As far as it is known it is
the only brooder that uses this principle 
Further economy safety and de
pendability are provided for by the
use o f an accurate thermostat to keep
the temperature where it is wanted 
Plans for the brooders will soon be
available The brooder will also be
on display and explained at the 1940
state Farm and Home Week next
January 
From far away California comes

M ISSION ARY PICTURES A T THE
FULL GOSPEL TAB ERN ACLE
Pictures o f an airplane and boat
trip to the Andes mountain region in
Venezuela South America will be
shown at the Full Gospel Tabernacle
on Thursday at 8 p m where the
Rev Paul J Bicket is the pastor 
These pictures show the missionary
work being done in and around the
city o f Barquisemeto an inland mountain
city o f 27 000 The life o f the
people both rich and poor will be
seen as well as their houses churches 
food clothing etc 
THE COOKIE JAR
Rev E Yngve Olson o f Kenosha 
who is bringing these pictures to the
city is a prospective missionary to
Venezuela where he expects to be
located some time in February and
before showing the pictures will give
a lecture on Missions The subject
o f hia discussion will be the problem
o f missionary work in general and o f
Venezuela situation in particular and
also the events leading up to his decision
to become with his wife and
two children a missionary to that
land 
Venezuela according to Rev Olson 
is about the size o f Texas A rkansas 
and Louisiana combined with
the approximate population o f Wisconsin 
However there are only
about 100 Protestant missionaries of
which only three are o f his denomination 
the assemblies o f God 
Since his graduation from the
Central Bible Institute at Springfield 
Mo Rev Olson has engaged for
seven years in evangelistic and pastoral
work in various parts o f the
state and for the last three and onehalf
years directed a successful Tabernacle
at Racine He is considered
to be a well-informed and interesting
speaker 
The general public is welcome to
this service 
Marcella Gill Relyea
One o f the chief joys o f being parents
is the knowledge o f how very
much our children love us Stoop to
lift one to your knee and soon they
are all crowding around a noisy happy
group each showing off a little to
claim his or her share o f attention 
They have such a vast capacity for
forgiveness too They can forget a
just punishment almost as soon as it
is over but injustice rankles long in
the back o f their minds and sometimes
leaves a scar that lasts a lifetime 
Not long ago my eldest caught
me in one o f those little white lies 
that I told to spare his feelings He
was so surprised and perplexed that I
felt like a very guilty culprit trying
to explain myself out o f a bad mistake 
Truly this job o f being a parent
is case o f practice what you
preach with a vengeance! We build
our own pedestals and it s up to us
to cling to them if we want our children
to live up to our expectations 
 There are little eyes upon you and
they re watching night and day
There are little ears that quickly take
- in every word you say 
There are little hands all eager to do
everything you do 
And a little girl who s dreaming o f
the day she ll be like you 
Theres a bright eyed little fellow who
believes you re always right
And his ears are always open and he
watches day and night 
You are setting an example every day
in all you do
For the little boy wrho s waiting to
grow up to be a man like you

Accidents usually leave scars 
different kinds o f scars There are
physical scars or course  the cuts 
bruises burns or whatever they may
be 
But the kinds o f scars that hurt
most are those that sear into our
minds and leave unhappy memories 
These scars seldom heal 
We can all think back to some
tragedy in which some one we knew
very well or perhaps some one in our
family played the leading part The
vividness o f such a memory depends
on the seriousness o f the accident

GIRL BASKET STARS
TO PLAY TEXACOS
A fast and hard scrapping squad
o f bucketeers from Augusta won a
close game from a rather listless Texaco
basketball team at the high school
gym Monday night Only Rhoades and
Osborn seemed to be fired with the
old Texaco fight but the combination
o f Osbom feeding and Rhoades scoring
wasn t enough to counteract the
fast floor play and accurate shooting
by the visitors The absence o f Christy 
Frost and Matalas was keenly felt 
but the boys still had enough to win
if the old fire had been there 
On Monday Dec 11 the Oilers will
match shots with the famous Helen
Stephans band o f female loopsters 
Helen made her acquaintance here
last summer when she appeared at the
county seat with the House o f David
baseball club Helen has her own
basket ball team composed o f the best
girl basket ball players in the U S 
Among them is Izzy Payne former
satellite o f the St Louis All
Stars who in a single game at Altoona
last year caged 33 points for
herself The gal is 5 feet 9 inches
and weighs 160 
Then there is Ella Chief Riley 
a Cherikee Indian girl from Vinita 
Okla who made Ripley s believe it
or not through her feat o f scoring
all 38 o f her team s points in a game
with Cleora Okla The girl is a deadly
shot and extremely clever with the
leather 
 Casey Osborn a sister o f the
famous Ruth Osborn o f Olympic
fame but no kin to the Texaco s
Chuck Osbom will occupy one o f the
guard positions Torchy Blasch who
spent last winter caging buckets in
Lithuania left Europe when Herr Hitler
started kicking up such a fuss and
is now with Miss Stephans Co-eds 
Fem Simmons o f Shelbina Mo a
breath-taking de-icer a grand guard
and exhibition artist has also been
engaged by Miss Stephans 
Then o f course Helen Stephans 
herself will be with her team in person 
She is one o f the greatest track
and field stars ever to represent the
stars and stripes in the world s Olympics 
She was voted the outstanding
woman athlete in the U S by the
Associated Press in 1936 and won 14
national athletic championships within
a period o f years 
That s the team for the game Dec 
11 May the best man win Personally
we will be rooting for the ladies

been doing anything o f late She said
that they had been acting rather mild 
but later I found out a little different 
Ennyhow we wonder what
this grampa business is Miss Hilger 
Skid it s too bad that you have a
stiff neck and that it takes you so

MERLIN H ULL S LETTE R
The regular session o f Congress is
less than four weeks away and the
budget makers are still far from completing
their estimates for the financial
expenditures for the next fiscal
year commencing on July 1st There
is t lk o f economy as always before
and in the early days o f every session 
Where and how to economize as yet
has been the main difficulty Expansion
o f the army and navy by anything
near that proposed is more likely
to expand the budget than any
other one item but there are others 
New taxes are suggested to meet
the extra armament program but no
such recommendation seems to be under
consideration by the Ways and
Means committee As in some former
sessions the tax proposition may drift
along until late in the spring when
the budget estimates may be found
too low and the annual deficit too
large Several tax bills have been
passed in that hasty manner in the
past ten years 
The expenditures for 1940 will be
about 9 billions except for the new
armament funds The revenues probably
will be larger than those o f this
year with a substantial increase in
income and corporation taxes coming
from improved business war orders
and bond and share values The budgeteers
believe that the revenues may
reach over 6 Vt billions Even then
there will be a deficit o f 3 billions 
which may crowd the bonded debt
limit o f 45 billions very closely Raising
the debt limit will be up to congress 
probably early in the session 
How high it will be proposed to raise
the limit is not yet stated The credit
o f the government seems not to be
suffering as the debt goes upward 
now in excess o f $40 4 billions The
Treasury solicited bids on another
half billion o f bonds at only 2 per
cent and the issue was subscribed
many times over There will be a
limit reached when deficits will have
to be met by taxes instead o f loans 
but not yet according to the experts 
Secretary Wallace has announced
that his department will ask for $750
million for payments to farmers who
participate in the agricultural adjustment
and soil conservation programs 
He plans to spend less for acreage
control and more for soil conservation 
The amount asked may seem
large for 6 000 000 farms It is about
double the annual expenditure for
CCC and its 300 000 enrollees While
the subsidies are widely distributed 
with the larger per cent o f the farms
sharing in the soil program cotton 
com rice and wheat share more
largely and dairying less but a determined
endeavor will be made at
the coming session to make dairy
products basic commodities the same
as the crops mentioned Parity payments 
which amount to about $225
millions may have difficulty getting
by congress unless dairying is included 
The acreage under the soil-depleting
program will remain at from 275
million to 285 million acres It is
proposed to reduce the corn acreages
by 6 million acres Corn acreage is
about one-third the total acreage and
wheat about 20 per cent The benefit
rate for corn is to be increased
from 9 to 10 cents per bushel and
wheat decreased from 17 to 9 cents
per bushel Cotton acreage will remain
at about 27 million bushels or
10 per cent o f the total and the benefit
payments slightly reduced Probably
no other proposed economy will
be as strongly advocated by the budget
reducers as that o f lessening the
amount for farm subsidies Air-mail
and ocean line subsidies have less difficulty 
The world-wide indignation over
the Russian attack on Finland is fully
shared in Washington The State department
has seldom been more aroused
by the ruthless aggression o f a
larger power upon a smaller and
peaceful nation It is likely that congressional
debate may start upon it as
soon as the session opens Abrogation
o f the treaty o f 1933 is a probability
if not a certainty Russian
gangdom excuses for the unwarranted
attack are not credited 
In our historv our country has not
been more betrayed in its affairs
with foreign countries than with
Russia It may be remembered how
that treaty was promoted for years
by Russian propaganda in this country
in which there was no limit to the
extent o f the promises and alleged
good faith Among other promises 
not included in the treaty however 
was that Russia would seek to liquidate
its indebtedness to our federal
treasury It amounted to $485 millions 
and with interest added to more
than a billion dollars It has defaulted
all payments made no attempt to
even negotiate a settlement and in
true Russian fashion has declined to
consider even interest payments Finland
has been paying regularly on
its debt according to agreement 
Still another inducement which led
to the treaty and which was played up
strongly was that Russia would buy
hundreds o f millions o f dollars worth
o f our industrial products and help
restore prosperity In fact some of
the large corporations which anticipated
reaping huge profits in the new
Russian trade were liberal with their
own propaganda for the treaty They
have been disallusioned just as has
our State department The annual
Russian purchases o f our products
here have amounted to far less than
have those o f a single city like St 
Paul or Minneapolis The futility of
trying to base increased industrial activity
o f our own country by exports
to a country- like Russia have become
apparent One consequence o f the
treaty was that in 1938 imports o f
butter from Russia were larger than
from any other country and its gold 
mined by convict labor at a very low
cost has flowed in freely 
Another promise included in the
treaty was that Russia would cease
to finance communistic propaganda
and other activities in this country 
Revelations before the Dies committee
indicate that the promise has been
violated constantly and that much o f
the communist movement in industrial
centers is backed by that government 
There is every reason why
the State department should drop all
relations with Russia as it is intimated
it will do Senator Pittman o f
the Senate Foreign Affairs committee 
who often speaks what the State
department desires to have said has
takeD a firm stand regarding it 
The committee appointed by the
President to investigate monopolistic
practices in industries has let loose a
blast against five big firms which it
states dominate cheese prices It alleges
that the Plymouth Cheese Exchange 
at Plymouth Wisconsin 
which supposedly sets the price o f
cheese in the state and nation is
dominated controlled by and sets the
price according to the dictation o f the
five corporations 
This finding is along the same lines
as that o f the Federal Trade Commission 
which published an extended report
after years o f investigation It
found also that dairy products were
largely sold under monopolistic domination
in practically every big city
in the country A delegation o f congressmen
called on the Department of
Justice months ago calling attention
to past and recent investigations
which disclosed the manner in which
both farmers and consumers are made
to pay huge profits to these corporations
and their subsidiaries They
asked in particular that suits at once
be instituted upon facts already attained 
At the special session they
were advised that the Department was
proceeding toward court action but
that lack o f funds prevented the
haste that was demanded The losses
to farmers and consumers by this
monopoly amount to more daily than
a dozen such actions would cost but
it has always been difficult to get congress
to vote funds for trust busting 
 Economy always shows up when
the dairy district representatives seek
to obtain funds to put an end to robbery
by monopoly The G-men might
well be called in to help along the
Department s investigation They may
have been at that

H EAP TEPEE T A L K
By Smoke Signal Redcloud
Again as in years past the deer
season opened with a bang!
Every one we meet querys get
your buck  with down cast glance
we reply No no luck But I do not
worry for it makes no difference now 
The first morning o f the deer season
we arrived in the deer country
about 6 30 C S T The air was a bit
frosty not unpleasantly nippy but
more exhilarating than anything else 
The atmosphere was quiet It was
so quiet you could her a dew drop
about ten feet away I kept wondering
from what direction shooting
would first take place About ten
minutes to seven there came a terrierlike
bark o f a 25-20 over to my right
about a mile away That was the
first shot I heard in the country
where I was Something like three
minutes passed when again to my
right about three-quarters o f a mile
away came the business-like bucko
-o ! buck-o-o! o f a hi-powered rifle 
It buckoed five times and then silence 
A neighbor boy got his buck 
Four misses and the fifth a fatal
shoulder shot at 35 rods 
From then on the heavy artillery
kept up a steady fusilade punctuated
now and then by sharp yaps o f small
calibred rifles Every so often came
the usual doe-o-o! doe-o-o! o f rifled
slug splitting shotguns 
Well men how do you like April
hunting in November  I am o f the
opinion that more venison have spoiled
on the hand o f hunters than at any
time within the last five years 
The second and third mornings o f
the deer season were the most beautiful
mornings a hunter have ever
seen A grayish-white hoary frost
blanketed all the trees and shrubs 
and when the sunlight struck them 
Ah! it was just like a scene within
a dream unreal beautiful beyond
description No thought or desire to
kill should have entered into the mind
o f anyone But just the one triggerfinger
itched and kept itching whenever
a herd o f deer came running by
over frozen runways Their drumming
hoofs reminded one very much
o f the riding o f the lone ranger 
America and Americans sit today
on the ringside closely observing great
nations at war What will be the ultimate
outcome of all this  The last
world s war was fought to end all
wars in order to start new and bigger
and not better wars One never
thought that things like these could
ever happen in a civilized world like
ours Reading the newspapers and
listening in on the news commentators
is like reading one o f Edgar Rice
Burrough s novels such as Mars The
Warlord of Mars or The Princess of
Mars But they do say  Truth is
stranger than fiction 
The administrative and supervisory
end o f the Soil Conservation Service
o f this city was well represented
among the lucky deer hunters who got
their buck the first day The lucky
representatives are Richard (Dicky)
Nelson Stanley De Boer Gust Spiering
and Brownie O Brien If there
are any others raise your right hands

Fall Creek Beat* Taylor
By Ernest Rumppee
The classy Fall Creek team came
to Taylor and defeated the home team
in a tough battle on Nov 28 by the
score o f 37 to 29 It was a close
game all the way with lead changing
hands often Long shots which connected
quite frequently for both the
teams brought the crowd to its feet
often because o f the suddenness o f
which they came 
In the last quarter three men on
the Fall Creek team seemed to connect
from anywhere on the floor and
scored 15 points to clinch the game 
Olson led the scoring for Fall
Creek with 18 points followed by Jun
gerberg who connected five times
with his longe and added a free throw
for 11 points 
Duane Lambert hit his strike on
the offense by scoring 9 points Raymond
Owen followed him with 8
points and Alfred Waller Jr was a
close third with 7 points 
Score by quarters

years attested his own faith in RUX
in the following words o f his experience
 
 I have come down the stairs when
the pain from rheumatic attacks has
been so strong that I have had to
hang on to the railing to keep from
falling as my leg would just seem to
give way 
 I heard that RUX compound was
recommended for Rheumatic pain attacks
and I am very glad to say that
I am using RUX and that it has relieved
those nerve-wracking pains in
my body I am glad that I found RUX
because now I can sleep more soundly 
and in fact feel much better for
tie relief it has given me in these attacks
