FORTY-SIXTH YEAR. WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN, THURSDAY, JU LY 6, 19.19 NUMBER 34

School Consolidation
A consolidation program for many
of Wisconsin’s small school districts,
an economy educational plan advocated
by local and state officials, educators
and taxpayer organizations for
years, has made definite progress this
year with the passage and enactment
of three new laws by the 1939 legislature.
Sponsored by the state department
of public instruction, the bills were
enacted into law with little debate, in
spite of the fact that similar attempts
to effect reforms in the school system
in previous legislatures were defeated
after long arguments.
The throe new measures recently
passed would:
1. Allow the state superintendent
of public instruction, John Callahan,
on his own motion, to attach those districts
with less than $100,000 assessed
valuation to contiguous districts.
2. Change the common school tuition
statute to provide for tuition
charges on the basis of dividing the
cost of maintaining the school, minus j J ane
state and county aids, by the number. .Tanio>
plan which would allow Wisconsin
voters to decide at the 1940 April election
if they want to finance an “adequate”
old age pension plan through
a sales tax on articles, except food,
selling for 25 cents or more.
The resolution suggesting the plan
had previously been killed, but was
reconsidered and' approved when sections
which would have asked whether
pensions should be financed by an additional
tax on real estate and personal
property, or by both a sales tax and
property tax increase, were taken out.
The resolution now goes to the senate
for concurrence.

the flat $250 per teacher state andj Christ in his youth and containing the

with less than 10 pupil enroll- ments, and a page article of “ My
ments. Responsibilities,” were handed to all
$100,000 District Yardstick attending the services as they entered
Perhaps the most far-reaching of ^ e church,
the new laws is the one allowing the
state superintendent to consolidate
low-evaluation districts. There are
mopevthan 1400 schools in 58 Wisconsin
coiTnties which can be affected by I
this bill.
However, V. E. Kimball, assistant]
state supcrint*H*lenW«4Mis Kteted Uuu
it is unlikely that such a large number
will be affected directly because of
the dissimilarity of local circumstances
which must be considered for
proper school administration.
He explains that the policy of the
department of public instruction will
be guided and controlled hy the educational
and physical welfare of the
children, geographic conditions, transportation
facilities, ro ad -, distances
between schools, and possible economies.
Mr. Kimball also states that the
right of the people to operate a small
school is in no way abridged, but that
the state and county are relieved of
financial obligation when the insistence
for such operation is not in the
best public interest.
Figuring Tuition Costs
Tho second important change in administration
of common school districts
is designed to prevent school
officers from charging tuition from
outside pupils for use of state and
county money.
Under the old statute the tuition of
elementary pupils was computed by
dividing the cost of the teacher’s
salary by the total enrollment. Education
authorities point out that this
procedure results in the use of state
and county aids for fixing and paying
tuition.
The old law also allowed the electors
at the annual school meeting to set
any tuition charge they saw fit, which
left the possibility of exorbitant tuition
charges.
Tuition will now be dote rmined by
dividing the cost of maintaining the
school, minus state and county aid- ,
by the number of pupils enrolled.
Per Teacher Aids
It is expected that consolidation and
suspension of smaller elememtary
schools will be encouraged by the new I
per capita teacher aid schedule.
Prior to the passage of the new act.
aids were distributed, exclusive of
equalization aids, on the basis of $250
per teacher in the elementary schools
hy both the county and the state.
Under the new law aids will be distributed
on the basis of $25 per pupil
for all schools with less than 10 pupils.
The hill arms to make possible a
better distribution of funds by both
county and state to schools servicing
the largest number of pupils. It aims
to make it undesirable for communities
to operate schools for sentimental
reasons, for giving jobs, to relatives
for fuel contracts, etc., simply because
the state and county furnish the
money.
Under the old schedule one-room
schools with 50 pupils received aids
on the same basis as one-room schools
with but two pupils. The state department
of public instruction has reported
that there are now more than
GOO schools in the state enrolling less
than 10 pupils.

HOURS OF WPA
WORKERS UP,
RATESSLASHED
Word was received on Monday by
the WPA office that all work on projects,
shut down for several days, was
to he resumed on Ju ly 6.
A sweeping reduction in hourly
wage rates for WPA workers and a
compensating increase in hours of
work per month, were also announced.
On the single crews, the men are to
roport at 8 a. m. and on all double
crews the first crew is to report at 6
a. m. and th e ' second at 12 o’clock
noon.
Philip D. Flanner, state WPA director,
said in an Asseciated Press dispatch
that 4,500 persons were to be
remove*d this week from relief projects
to cut the state rolls to 58,000 for the
month of July.
Colonel F. C. Harrington. Works
Projects commissioner, ordered the
July WPA cut from 2,600,000 to 2,-
400,000 to keep within limits set by
congressional relief appropriations.
Most significant aspect of the
change which goes into effect throughout
the nation Wednesday morning is
that the WPA worker noto has a
month-long job instead of the halftime
employment he formerly enjoyed.
Under the old system, the working
month was divided into two pe»riods,
with separate crews working in each.
The month of 130 hours will now be
considered as the unit.
The new system, according to observers.
is the answer to critics of
WPA who charged that in numberless
cases the WPA worker was obtaining
wages on the project and earning a
comfortable additional sum in private
employment during his two-wet»ks layoff
e*ach month.
WPA workers in the rural areas will
suffer more than their city brethren
bv reason of the change. Thirty additional
hours of work— from 100 to
130— will bring them a total monthly
wage of only $40 if they are in the
unskilled class and $45 and $55. respectively,
for semi-skilled and skilled
labor.

cars were badly elamage*d.
Ed. Smith Buried Yesterday
Ed. Smith, 71, a Winnebago Indian,
a native of Nebraska and a resident
of the town of Wittenberg for about
twelve years, passed away on Monday

manner, as there was no other clue to
their entrance.
When the depot was broken into on
June 1 entrance was made by breaking
the paelletck from the door.

News From the Hill
Last Thursday evening the teachers
and other workers were invite»el to
supper at the home of Rev. and Mrs.
Sihler. Mrs. Lawrence. Mr. Tom
Swenson and Laura Rasmussen were
also among the guests.
By Friday evening n small family
was left em the hill. Rev. Sihler and
the four Soldier girls left Friday
morning for Oconomowoc and the Jensen
home where the girls have been
invite»d to live for 2 months. (Miss E.
Jensen is District President of the
I,. I). R. and visited Wittenberg last
fall). After dinner the children and
teachers began to leave by one’s and
two’s. It ’s strange how attached we*
become to one another in four brief
weeks and how lonely the Hill is, when
the new friends and old have left.
At morning devotions Friday morning
each class gave a demonstratie>n
of what they had lcarne*d. Most impressive
were the numerous scripture
passages all had memorized—even the
primary children.
Sunday night Mr. Ed. Smith died
afte*r a lingering illnens. He leaves
his wife Susie and four chilelren. Paul,
Le Roy, Shirley and Donald, and a son
by a former marriage, Joe Smith. One
daughter, Isabelle, died this spring.
Funeral service's were? held Wednesday
morning.
On Thursday of this we*ek a great
number of our Indians from Witten-j

POLITICS:
Looking to 1940
“ A year ago when the President sent
his $4^00,000,000 lend spend message to
congress, I said it uas lik e putting a shin
plaster on a cancer. This plan now is
jus t another shin plaster.”
What looks like a shin plaster to
North Carolina’s Sen. Josiah W. Bailey
looks to dubious U. S. business
men as a timely reiteration of the
politico-economic philosophy President
Roosevelt expounded before
congress last Janu ary 4, namely,
that “ government investment” in U.
S. financial stability should not
merely be an emergency stop gap,
but a long-range standard policy.
The new plan:
Government agencies would issue
extra-budgetary federal-guaranteed
securities for financing self-liquidating
projects. Special U. S. authori-

While Senate Majority Leader Alben
Barkley assured reporters the
measure would pass immediately,
political wiseacres took great pains
to make an undiluted election issue
of it. Almost universally overlooked
was the White House’s violent retreat
from the costly, ineffectual
pump-priming methods it has tried
before, which consisted not of loans
but straight spending. Also overlooked
was the small size of a sevenyear
$3,860,000,000 program compared
with $20,678,000,000 the New
Deal spent on recovery and relief
from 1933 to 1938. Nevertheless
m an y a vital hole and many a political
portent could be read from the
measure:
Politics. With 10,000,000 still unemployed
and national income about
$12,000,000,000 under the “ ideal” of
$80,000,000,000 a year, the administration
will obviously seek to perpetuate
itself in 1940 by stimulating
a temporary recovery as in 1938. Republicans
and conservative Democrat*
point out that the new lending
plan provides $870,000,000 to be
spen* next year; with F H A ’s new
lending power ($800,000,000), with
the emergency relief appropriation
($1,735,000,000, and record agricultural
subsidies ($1,000,000,000) the
coming fiscal year will bring expenditures
of $4,405,000,000 as a prelude
to the campaign and election.
However sincere the President’s intentions
for recovery, the political
connection is inescapable and leads
m an y observers to believe Mr.
Ro'>sevelt will positively seek a third
term.
Finance. Fears of orthodox U. S.
financiers went unnoticed in the deluge
of political comment. Among
the fears:
C It was recalled that even Braintruster
Adolf Berle Jr ., assistant
secretary of state, recently said
such lending methods must eventually
lead to government absorption
of the country’s most productive
plants.
€L Mr. Roosevelt's insistence that the
so-called “ self liquidating” bonds be
taxable brought investigation which
revealed many projects are selfsustaining
by so close a margin that
to tax the bonds would make them
a losing investment.
C. Loans to municipalities will be
blocked in many cases by local laws
and state regulations covering municipal
indebtedness. Most large cities,
moreover, have already reached
their debt limit.
C Since the Johnson act forbids new
loans to nations already indebted to
the U. S., only South America and
Scandinavian countries could use the
$500,000,000 trade - boosting loan.
Financiers fear a loss here, since
there is no method to force collection
short of war.
C Leasing of equipment to ra ilroads
would, it is alleged, be an unsatisfactory
substitute for the remedial
legislation necessary to place
U. S. carriers back on their feet.
Restoration of rail prosperity is regarded
as far preferable.
FRANCE:
Lesson
When French Foreign Minister
Georges Bonnet signed a mutual assistance
pact with Turkish Ambassador
SUad Davaz, Italo-German aggression
into the eastern Mediterranean
seemed effectively stymied.
Moreover, for Signor Benito Mussolini
it was an object lesson in gentlemanly
behavior. Results: (1) Turkey
is wooed away from the Rome-
Berlin axis; (2) Anglo-French wartime
control of the strategic D ardanelles

A pop-eyed Japanese consul
in Shanghai received an unexpectedly
brusque message recently
for transmittal to Tokyo. It
said that the
American navy
will go “ wherever
necessary” to
protect American
citizens and that
it expects no interference
from
Ja p a n , who has
been trying to
shove Occidentals
out of the Orient.
The message
came from Rear A dm iral Harry
E. Yarnell, spare native of Independence,
Iowa, director of
America’s Asiatic fleet and unofficial
Far Eastern diplomatic
representative since October,
1936. It was almost the parting
shot of a man who has won virtually
all disputes with Japan growing

Turkey won the strategic Republic

probably illegal in League of Nations’
eyes, under whose mandate
France ruled it, Turkey nevertheless
gained by negotiation what Italy
has been unable to gain by threat.
Stubborn Frenchmen still refuse to
bow before Mussolini's demands for
Suez canal rights, the Addis Ababa-
Djibouti railroad and Italian m inority
rights in Tunisia.
NAVY:
Sprrd-l Ip
Fiscal year’s start Ju ly 1 means
new funds for new work in most
U. S. government departments. Biggest
appropriations for the 1939-40
fiscal year cover rearmament, and
before Ju ly has passed into history
the navy will be well under way
with three new jobs:
Bases. Costing $65,000,000 are 12
plane and submarine bases for
which congress has appropriated
$31,621,000 to handle the first year’s
work. Outlying bases will be at San
Juan, Puerto Rico; Kaneohe and
Pearl Harbor, H aw aii; Sitka and
Kodiak, Alaska; Midway island;
Johnston island and Palm yra island
in the western Pacific. Continental
bases will be at Pensacola and Ja c k sonville,
F la., and Tongue Point,
Ore.
Ships. E arly June found 75 warships
under construction, the program
running ahead of last year.
Meanwhile 24 new ships are being
rushed, including two 45,000-ton "s u per”
battleships. A ll will be laid
down in 1940 and will cost about
$350,000,000.
Planes. Effective immediately the
“ speed-up" policy will be applied to
500 new airships, whose completion
during the 1939-40 fiscal year will
bring the navy's total to 2,132.
H o w I t W o r k s
A N G L O - U . 8 . B A R T E R P A C T
Most nations are deficient in
some natural resources and have
too much of others. In wartime,
inability to export non-essentials
and import essentials would be a
military handicap. Friendly nations
can prepare in advance
against such emergencies without
disturbing their economic balances.
Under the new American-
British barter treaty, the U. S.
will give England $30,000,000
worth (or 800,000 bales) of surplus
COTTON, such as Britain needs
for shells like these. It will
come from 11,300.000 bales held
by the U. S. as security for
loans to farmers, thereby relieving
pressure on the domestic
market. In return, Britain will
give the U. S. 85,000 tons of
R U B B E R , such as the army
would need in wartime for purposes
like tires for the above antitank
gun. Britain will buy the
rubber on open market. Each
nation will hold the reserves for
seven years as war stocks. L ater
other materials may be b artered,
for America needs items
like tin, chromium and manganese.
Although the U. S. deplores
barter as fostered by
Germany, the new arrangement
will merely supplement existing
"favored nation" treaties and is
not a basic economic tenet.

« Briefly Told »
AGRICULTURE:
Stranne Feelinz
America’s “ dust bowl” lies roughly
in the Panhandles of Texas and
Oklahoma, eastern New Mexico and
Colorado, and western Kansas. In
1936, at the drouth’s depth, some
16.000.000 acres of once-valuable
grain and grazing land lost part of
its topsoil under ferocious winds that
brought no moisture.
Reclamation followed, featured
chiefly by conservation of rainfall
and "fastening down” of the soil
with hardy vegetation. Thousands
of square miles were terraced and
cultivated in contour furrows that
held the moisture and stopped erosion.
By this spring the 16,000,000
blow” acres were reduced to
800.000.
As wind-weary farmers began
harvesting the sum m er's crop, they
could look back on a prodigious job
well done. Whereas 1935 yielded a
wheat crop of only 4,000,000 bushels,
the dust bowl’s elevator men expect
from 15,000,000 to 25,000,000
bushels when this season's grain is
threshed.
Smiling, likewise, were drouthridden
farmers of northern plains
states (Nebraska, North and South
D a k o t a , Wyoming, Montana),
Though their land was still quite
dry and this year's prospects none
too good, they have felt something
unusual this summer—rain.
TRANSPORTATION:
Pedestrians
“ lie has been sadly neglected and has
h ad to shift for himself. He has evolved
the simple philosophy that his jo b is to
get across the street as best he can. f / a Cins with other pedestrians in mass r i o
tion o f traffic lights. In rural areas he
walks on the pavement, on the wrong
side o f the road, and wears dark clothing
at n ight."
This, said the National Safety
Council’s Leslie J . Sorenson, is the
plight of U. S. pedestrians who in
1938 accounted for three out of every
five persons killed in traffic accidents.
What made the situation
more startling were figures showing
two-thirds of pedestrians killed were
violating a traffic ordinance or committing
an unsafe act. Thirteen per
cent of them had been drinking;
only 9 per cent of drivers involved in
fatal accidents had been drinking.
Suggested cure: Make pedestrians
obey stop signals and other traffic
regulations just as automobile drivers
must do; build sidewalks in the
country.

CARTER FIELD
Political strategy of the
New Dealer* teems to be to
start hitting the most likely
opponent early . . . American
merchant marine in danger
of receiving another blow . . .
Developments in the Democratic
sparring match for the
presidential nomination are
thick and furious.
Senator
Vandenberg
WASHINGTON.—It has been rather
widely quoted that President
Roosevelt, in introducing Senator
A rthur H. Vandenberg of Michigan
to King George at the famous B ritish
embassy garden party, commented:
"This is the m an who
thinks he is going to succeed me
next year, but he isn’t.” Also that
the President did not mention Vandenberg’s
name.
It has not been widely quoted at
all, even in Michigan, that the following
day, when
Senator Vandenberg
was presented to the
king in the Capitol,
the king said: “ l a m
very glad to get
your name in order
to connect it up with
what occurred yesterday.”
All of which is
chiefly of interest in
that Mr. Roosevelt’s
feeling about this
particular candidate
for his seat cropped out so visibly
that even a visiting ruler, whose
m ind was concentrated almost entirely
on trying to do the right thing
and make an impression which
would not let England down, noticed
it.
It is of a piece with the President’s
reference to Thomas E. Dewey
as "th a t little two-spot,” and to
the cam paign the New Dealers have
been so consistently conducting
since last winter against Senator
Robert A. Taft of Ohio.
The point here is not whether this
is sound strategy or not. If the best
political traditions are to be followed,
it would seem to be. Start
hitting the most likely opponent
early.
The importance at the moment is
that apparently this is the strategy
of the New Deal, and that the No.
1 target has changed three times
since last November. In that month
the rem ark about Dewey being a
“ two-spot” was made. By February
apparently the New Dealers
were figuring that Taft was the m an
they had to beat. By June of this
year Vandenberg had moved up to
this dangerous position.
Later On I t Probably
W ill Be Some One Else
Next September it may be somebody
else. Undoubtedly three or
four more Republicans will be on
this hot spot before next June, when
all doubts will be resolved by the
Republican national convention.
Dewey is still the most popular
Republican for the nomination if one
believes the polls. But inside New
Deal information is that he began
slipping rapidly some tim e back so
far as the men apt to control the
delegates are concerned. Dewey
does not hit the New Deal and
Roosevelt himself so hard as most
Republican leaders would like.
So Taft went into top position, as
fa r as they are concerned, and it
did n 't take the New Deal scouts long
to find this out. Then Taft was hurt
by two things. One was his failure
to make a hit at several important
gatherings where he spoke, of which
one was the annual dinner of the
newspaper editors. The other was
the reported dislike for his chief opponent
for the Buckeye delegation,
Gov. John W. Bricker of Ohio, by
the county ch airm an of that state.
This put Vandenberg out front,
which is the reason he seemed the
chief menace to continuance of the
New Deal early in June. It m ay be
of course that Mr. Roosevelt was
also especially annoyed with the
M ichigan senator because it wasVandenberg
who directed the successful
fight to block further appropriations
for the F lorida ship canal.
American Merchant Marine
To Receive Another Bloic
Something is always cropping up
to prevent tbe development of an
Am erican merchant marine. Now
it is about to receive another blow.
The house foreign affairs committee
went out of its way to prevent it.
but the blow is almost surely coming
when the so-called Bloom bill
(introduced by Representative Sol
Bloom along the lines advocated by
Secretary of State Cordell H ull) gets
over to the senate.
The trouble lies in the “ cash and
c a rry ” provisions of the measure.
The bill provides that munitions
and war materials m ay be sold
abroad, even to belligerents, and
m ay be shipped, but it also provides
that title to the goods must
be transferred from American ownership
before the goods leave American
harbors.
The original cash and carry provision,
regarded as going a long
way toward removing the danger
of possible incidents, forbade their
shipment in American vessels. The
Bloom bill was changed in this respect
so as to p erm it the use of
American bottoms in shipping war
supplies abroad. The prevailing argument
in the house committee waa
that if ships flying the United States
flag were barred from this trade,
thia would be another blow to American
shipping, and a deterrent to
building American ships.
Under the Bloom bill ships flying
the American flag m ay transport
anything they please except
that they m ay not enter zones
which, after the breaking out of
war, m ay be declared dangerous
by the President of the United
States.
But on the senate side of the Capitol
this idea of permitting ships flying
the United States flag to carry
munitions of war to the ports of a
belligerent country’ seems a very
dangerous doctrine to the group of
senators anxious to isolate this country—
or insulate to use the latest
word—against every possible danger
of war.
Danger of an ‘Incident’
That Might Lead to War
Senators in this group insist that
the danger of an “ incident” is just
as great—just as apt to inflame the
people of this country to a stage
where war might result—if a ship
flying the American flag and
manned by United States seamen
were torpedoed as though United
States nationals also owned the
cargo she was carrying.
They do not see any difference in
the possible effects. They do not
think that the shipment of m unitions
to belligerents should be permitted
at all, and would like to prevent
the shipment of all war supplies,
but recognize that the opposition
to them is too strong to permit
their going this far.
But in the amendment of the present
neutrality act they are sure they
can work up enough popular sentiment
on their side to prevent ships
flying the United States flag from
sailing with loads of foreign owned
munitions—though produced in the
United States and sold by United
States nationals — to belligerent
ports.
Bitterness Against Jones
Something to Write About
Developments in the Roosevelt-
Garner-Farley-McNutt presidential
sparring are as thick and furious as
though this were next spring instead
of the Democratic National
convention being a full year off.
Within the last week bitterness of
m any of the New Dealers against
Garner has reached the danger
stage, all of it resulting from what
the New Dealers assumed to be a
Garner-inspired story which stated
that the vice president would stick
to the end, regardless of any other
development, in his fight for the
nomination.
As a matter of fact, G arner did
not know about this story before it
was printed. But it so happens that
it was written by the Washington
correspondent of a Texas newspaper
owned by Jesse H. Jones!
Hence bitterness against Jones is
something to write home about. The
New Dealers are calling h im everything
from an "in g rate ” up and
down.
Moreover, they are trying to cut
in on G arner’s Texas strength now
by flirting with Sam Rayburn,
Democratic leader of the house, on
the notion that Rayburn m ay be
nominated for vice president, with
Roosevelt as head of the ticket, next
year. This same hope is being held
out to a number of other Democrats
who they have reason to fear might
not go along with the Roosevelt
forces—otherwise—at the- convention.
Mot Disloyal for Any
Democrat to Make the Race
"W h y shouldn’t any Democrat run
for the nom ination?" one of them
demanded of the writer. “ Roosevelt
has not said one word to indicate
that he intends to run. But even if
he did tomorrow, does that mean
that it is disloyal for any other
Democrat to have aspirations? And
disloyal to whom? They talk about
G arner’s pledging himself for the
‘duration’ at the Philadelphia convention.
What do they mean ‘duration’?
As long as Roosevelt lives?
Roosevelt doesn’t own the Democratic
party. If he wants the nomination
nothing will prevent his going
after it. But there is nothing
disloyal, to the party or to anybody,
in any Democrat who chooses m a k ing
the race. O ur m an is in the
fight, and he will win.”
One development that caused
much surprise was the statement of
Senator S h e r m a n
Minton of Indiana
that P aul V. McNutt
would be a candidate
only in the
event that Roosevelt
decides not to run for
a third term. As few
people in Washington
really doubt that
Roosevelt will try,
o r t h a t McNutt
u i thinks anything else,
S e n . M in t o n t h l s i s t a k e n a s „ b i(j
by McNutt for the vice presidential
nomination.
As a result, the Texans have been
digging in further on the Indiana
situation. They had been making
cautious inquiries before, trying to
get second-choice commitments. An
insider in the Garner movement
tells the writer that unless there are
some unexpected upsets Roosevelt
will probably get 19 of Indian's
delegates and Garner nine.

Heale had no more than finished
giving instructions when Doctor
Cabler arrived. The physician was
■ sm all m an, grizzled, ■ little bent,
his shoulders surprisingly heavy,
with a steady, severe eye. Alter the
introductions, Inspector Heale put
the case to him .
Tope, watching the Doctor, thought
his lips stiffened and grew pale as
he listened; and after Inspector
Heale had finished, the physician
was silent for a while.
“ Her heart was not strong,” he
said at last reflectively. No one
commented on this; and in the end
he nodded, surrendering.
MI had overlooked that point,” he
confessed. “ Yes, gentlemen, it must
be tru e !”
“ You mean she must have had
more than four tablets?” Heale
asked.
"Unquestionably,” Doctor Cabler
agreed. “ To die so quickly.”
Inspector Heale said seriously:
“ You understand, Doctor Cabler,
this gives her death the look of m urder.”
Doctor Cabler nodded slowly. " I t
seems incredible," he declared.
"A nd yet—there is something terrible
in those houses up there. Mrs.
Bowdon rules them all. She has
something massive in her. something
like a crushing weight.
"H ow about Mr. Bowdon?” In spector
Tope asked; and Doctor Cabler
said guardedly:
“ He surrendered years ago. He
is not at all well. His heart plays
ugly tricks, and his blood-pressure
is very high. He has not long to
live.” And he added: “ I have sometimes
thought it was his imminent
death which oppressed them a ll.”
The Inspector nodded. “ I don’t
w ant to come right out and say
'murder,' Doctor Dabler,” he explained.
“ But we want to look
around inside the house. Mrs. Tope
here suggested that they would all
go to the funeral. I f they do, the
house would be empty then.”
Suddenly, then, Tope asked:
"Doctor, can this drug be bought
by anyone, without prescription?"
" F ro m a friendly pharmacist, perhaps.
By some subterfuge.”
“ Mrs. Leaford had used it long?”
“ Four or five years. I supplied it
to her myself. She did not even
know the name. I gave it to her in
p lain bottles, without a label, so
that she would not know what it
was. This was for her own protection.
She could not secure it except
through m e.”
“ If someone wished to poison
her,” Tope suggested steadily,
“ that person m ight have stolen tablets
out of her bottle, one at a time,
over a period of weeks, without the
theft being noticed. So he would
have them when the tim e came.”
“ Readily,” the Doctor agreed. “ I
urged Mrs. Leaford to keep a count
of the tablets she took; but she
was careless and impetuous. She
took an overdose once before. Three
tablets. It made her very ill.”
“ I ’m trying to understand," Tope
explained, "how she was persuaded
or compelled to take the extra dose.
Were there any bruises on her lips,
Doctor?”
Doctor Cabler (hook his head.
"N o , none.”
"W a s there any other medicine
she was accustomed to take? In
capsules, for instance? So that
someone could have crushed some
pills into powder and filled a capsule
and put it with the others she
h a d ? "
The Doctor said again: “ No. I
know of nothing of the kind.” He
rose, and he repeated: “ No, nothing.
I can’t help you there.” And
he asked in a hushed voice: “ In spector,
what w ill you do?”
Inspector Heale hesitated. “ I
don’t yet know,” he confessed.
Inspector Heale went with h im to
the door. And a few moments afterward
Asa Taine was announced.
Tope watched Asa with a deep attention,
from the young man's flrst
appearance. This Asa Taine—he
m ay have been no more than thirty,
but he looked older, and there was
the shadow of dissipation on his
countenance—acknowledged the introductions
quietly, but with a
quick, appraising glance for Tope
and for Miss Moss. He spoke in a
slow, sardonic tone, facing them
fairly.
“ I'm told you want to see m e,”
he said. "W h y ? "
And before Inspector Heale could
speak, he added in a grim drawl:
“ To save lying, I m ig h t say that I
can guesa you think Kitty L eaford'i
death was murder, so you can begin
your explanations there.”
“ Well, there are certain circumstances—"
Heale began. “ Someone
was in Mrs. Leaford’s room after
she went to sleep."
“ How do you know?”
“ Because Miss Leaford put a certain
bottle in the medicine cabi-
"Crushed with grief.”
net in her mother’i bathroom, and
it is gone.”
Asa Taine smiled without mirth,
and drew from his pocket a small
square bottle. "H ere it i s ! " he said.
There was a moment's incredulous
hush; then Inspector Heale
asked sharply: "H ow do you know
this is it? ”
“ I ’ve seen it often enough," Asa
declared.
“ Where? When?”
"K itty liked to play ‘grande
d am e ’,” Asa explained. "She used
to hold receptions in bed. She’d
stay in bed half the day, sometimes.
R ab and I liked her; and we used to
go up and visit with her there. June
and Grandm a Bowdon did too."
“ Where did you find it? ” Heale
demanded. “ This bottle.”
" I n the cellar,” said Asa. “ Under
the laundry-chute.”
"H ow ’d you happen to look down
there?”
"Second sight, m aybe,” Asa suggested.
"Viewing the scene of the
c r im e !”
"W h at made you think It was a
c rim e ?” Inspector Heale snapped.
They were all watching him
acutely; but Asa Taine said simply:
" K it wouldn't kill herself. And an
ordinary overuose wouldn't kill her
so quickly. I've handled crim inal
law, you know.”
"See any strangers around?”
"W h y ? ” Asa countered warily;
and Tope said:
“ I heard there was • m an ln the
woods back of the house this morning
."
“ Oh, that was I , ” Asa assured
h im casually, “ I saw you. I was
afraid you’d spotted me, at the
tim e.”
Tope for once in his life was pink
with embarrassment; and Miss
Moss smiled faintly. But Tope
asked:
“ What were you doing? Why did
you hide?”
"P riv a te business,” said Asa gently.
Miss Moss asked: "M r . Taine, did
Mrs. Leaford leave a w ill? ”
“ No, m a d am ,” he said. “ I answer
you explicitly: She died intestate,
and insolvent too, for the matter of
that.”
They were for a moment silent,
and he turned toward the door; but
Inspector Heale said abruptly:
“ Wait a m inute ."
"T am e ,” Inspector Tope explained.
"Inspector Heale doesn't
want to make too much trouble; but
he must look into this. Can you
arrange to give him access to the
house during the funeral tomorrow
afternoon?"
The young m an hesitated. He said
at last; "Y e s. I should say so. You
can prowl all you want, but it’s too
late now. There’s nothing left to
find." And he exclaimed in a sudden
deep passion: “ If she was
killed, it was someone outside! They
might torture her, but they’d never
kill her. None of them up there.”
Then the door shut resoundingly
behind h im , and he was gone. In spector
Tope wiped his brow, and
Inspector Heale muttered angrily:
“ That fellow knows something.
Maybe I ought to hold on to him ,
make h im ta lk ."
But Tope shook his head. “ I f you
set out to arrest anyone right now,"
he pointed out, “ you'd have to start
with Miss Leaford.”
And Miss Moss suggested softly:
“ There m ight be another possibility.
I wonder if Mrs. Leaford’s husband
is still alive? And how he felt toward
h e r?”
The two men stared at her with
wide astonished eyes.
CH APT ER V III
The fortnight after K itty Leaford’s
death was for Inspector Tope
a long and tormenting tim e; for a
search of the Hurder house while it
stood empty revealed exactly nothing
at all. And his utmost urgencies
failed to drive Inspector
Heale to any vigorous action. And
Dr. Derrie abetted h im by sticking
to the accident theory.
The day after the funeral Tope
and Clint talked with Heale in his
office, and Tope said to Heale sternly:
“ Here’a m y notion. Inspector.
Mrs. Leaford was about the most
harmless person on Kenesaw HiU.
She hadn't hurt anyone; she d id n’t
want her own way about anything;
she d id n’t have any money; she
d idn't have • thing that would make
anyone want to kill her. But someone
did kill her; and whoever did it
had a deep, hidden reason for doing
it. And we don't know what that
reason was.
“ All right. Now if we—if you, In spector-
pretend you don’t suspect
anything, whoever did it will get
bold. He or she will do something
else. That's what you’re waiting
for, isn’t it? ” Inspector Heale nodded
an emphatic agreement, and
Tope said flatly: “ You know what
that something will be? Someone
else will be killed, up there!”
Inspector Heale stared at him .
“ Why?” he demanded. “ What
makes you figure that?”
"Because there wasn’t any reason
for killing Mrs. Leaford alone,"
Tope insisted. “ Killing her is bound
to have been a-part of a bigger
scheme. If you let things slide,
you’ll have another murder on your
hands.”
Clint, listening to the old man
whose wisdom he knew, felt himself
cold with fear for June, who dwelt
in that shuttered house where death
had been a visitor. But Inspector
Heale said with a slow, fretful violence:
"W ell, Inspector, I ’m glad to
have your advice, any time, of
course. But I have to make the decisions.
You’ll have to let me work
this out my own way.”
And they could not move him . On
the way back to town, Clint saw
Inspector Tope irritated for the flrst
tim e in his experience. “ I hate a
fool,” the old man said fretfully.
“ And Heale’s a fool. I tell you.
Clint, there’s death loose in those
old houses.”
For the rest of the drive the old
m an sat silent, absorbed in his own
reflections, till they came home to
the little house in Longwood, where
Miss Moss had dinner waiting. They
sat long at table, going over and
over the things they knew, seeking
to read their implications. And Miss
Moss was a guess ahead of the Inspector
tonight. Tope had reported
that Heale was trying to locate Jim
Glovere.
“ H e’s gone,” the Inspector pointed
out. “ So Heale thinks he’s run
away. Heale’s like one of these
whippets. He’ll chase anything that
runs.”
Miss Moss smiled faintly. " I may
be responsible for that,” she confessed.
"Y o u remember I suggested
to Heale that he try to find Kitty
Leaford’s husband.”
And the two m en stared at her;
and CUnt, whose thoughts now
turned always in one direction,
cried: "Y o u think this man is June's
fathe r?”
Miss Moss nodded.
“ What makes you think that?”
"W h y else did he live so near, except
to see Ju n e ? ” Miss Moss suggested.
“ And—why did they let him
Uve there, unless he had some such
hold on them ?”
C lint asked: “ Do you think June
knows who he is ? ”
Miss Moss shook her head; and
Tope said reflectively: " I f it’s true,
if that’s who Glovere is, and Heale
finds it out, he'U figure that Leaford
wanted to m arry someone else,
and poisoned Mrs. Leaford to be
free.”
" I haven’t seen the m an ,” Miss
Moss confessed. “ Do you think he
might have done it? Remember, the
front door of the house was open.
Someone went in from outside.”
Tope sat very still. “ No, Glovere,
or Leaford, or whatever his
name is, d idn't do it,” he decided.
" B u t Mrs. Tope, if Mrs. Leaford'a
glass of m ilk that night was poisoned,
why would anyone have to
go into the house from outside?
She'd drunk the m ilk and gone to
sleep before the door downstairs
was ever locked.”
^ ‘Someone m ig h t have stayed in
the house, left the door unbolted
when he went out.”
"B u t w h y ?" Tope insisted. “ If
Kitty Leaford was already as good
as dead, w h y ?" He said half to himself:
"Maybe they forgot to lock
the door, that night. I'm going to
see Mr. Hurder myself. See what
he has to say."
And he added: “ I want to figure
some way to meet Justus Taine too,
and his sons. See what they’re like.
I've met Asa, but not the other
one.”
Miss Moss sugpested an expedient
to this end; so during the next
few days Clint, in his capacity as
head of the Jervies Trust, pretended
to revive that old project of buying
some of the woodlands belonging
to the Kenesaw farm and cutting
them up into house lots. The
office of Bowdon and Taine controlled
the land; and CUnt made
an appointment to see R ab, and
took Tope with him.
R a b met them in friendly fashion,
discussed the project and made
shrewd comments; at Tope's suggestion
he led them into his father’s
office, and he and C lint shouted the
details of Clint's proposal into the
ears of Justus Taine, and that man
sat stolid and silent, his eyes blank,
watching Tope while he heard, or
did not hear, what they had to say.
H imself spoke at last half a dozen
words of dissent, and so dismissed
them.
After Kitty Leaford’s death,
Grandpa and G randm a Hurder
moved dumbly about the house,
crushed and broken with grief. June
tried to comfort and to reassure
them ; but once when she sought to
beguile Grandpa Hurder into some
peace of mind he said in slow tones:
"Y o u r mother was crucified,
June. For twenty years! And I was
to b lam e .”

Doctors Discover Cause of Lip Lesions;
Ariboflavinosis, Name Coined for It
In the future when baby refuses to

heard warning her against the dangers
of ariboflavinosis—that is, il
she can pronounce.
Two doctors of the National Institute
of Health, Drs. W. H. Sebrell
and R. E . Butler, adopted the word
which they adm it is "unfortunate"
but the best one they could think of
to describe the disease, says the
Washington Star.
Ariboflavinosis, they reported, is
the cause of Up lesions, which had
been marked in various parts of the
world but the cause of which had
never been determined.
The disease is due to the absence
of riboflavin in the diet, according
to their experiments. One of the
vitam in B group, riboflavin is widely
distributed in nature in such foods
as m ilk and other dairy products,
meat, eggs and green leafy vegetables.
Liver and dried brewer’s yeast
also are good sources of the vitamin.
The effect of the lack of the vitam
in on h um an beings was determined

In aviation films, he has employed

His film, “ Wings," of 1928, touched

Later, the diet was supplemented by

Ten of the 18 women developed

In most of these cases, the

The doctors said that meeting the

The First Rebel
I AMES SMITH led the first upris-
J ing of American colonists against
England, drew the first blood in
actual battle and all this 10 years
before the Revolution began.
At the age of 18, young Smith
was captured and held prisoner
for four years by the Caughnawaga
Indians. During this time he not
only acquired their skill in woodcraft
and their cunning in warfare
but a'so learned to hate the traffic I
in whisky and rifles that both the i
French and British were carrying
on with the Indians. He could see ;
the disastrous effects on the red
m an of the white m a n ’s greed for
money.
Smith organized a band of frontiersmen
called "B la c k Boys." in
1763. Their purpose was to keep the
drunk and bloodthirsty Indians out
of Conococheague valley. Blit two
years later. Smith decided that the
best way to flght them was to cut
off their source of supply for whisky
and arms. Accordingly, his
“ Black Boys" held up a pack train
and burned the goods.
On May 8, 1785, a platoon of B ritish
Highlanders, members of the
Forty-second regiment of His M a jesty's
arm y in America—the famous
“ Black Watch” —marched on the
town of Fort Loudon, Pa., to preserve
law and order and put this
lawless band of "B la c k Boys” in
their place.
But when the British soldiers
reached Sm ith ’s forces and Sgt. Mc-
G lasham ordered them to "H a iti
In the king's name, h a lt!” a pitched
battle followed in which the soldiers
were driven into the cabin of a certain
Widow Barr. The rebels kept
them there until the Britishers
agreed to m arch back to Ft. Loudon
from whence they came. And so
the truly first battle of the American
Revolution, fought 10 years before
the famous battle of Bunker
H ill, was won by America’s first
rebel, Jam es Smith.

A MONG the thousands of adventurers
who took part in the
gold rush to the Black Hills of South
Dakota in 1876 was Connecticut-born
Henry Weston Smith.
Smith arrived at Deadwood when
the town was at the height of its untamed
glory. But he was not seeking
gold. He picked rip roarin’
Deadwood to try out. his preaching
talents.
He preached in the streets, but
received no money for it, supporting
himself by m anual labor such as
cutting trees, chopping wood and firing
a sawmill boiler. Even hia
preaching was not only spiritually
but physically difficult—he had to
shout at the top of his voice to be
heard above the raucous calls of
the gamblers and entertainers.
On Sunday, August 20, 1876, after
his usual morning services in the
m ain street of Deadwood, he started
out for Crook City, 10 miles
away. He put his Bible in one pocket,
the copy of his sermon ln another
and pinned a note on his
cabin door that said, "Gone to Crook
City, and if God is willing, wiU be
back at 2 p. m .”
God wasn’t willing. When about
halfway there, he was stalked and
killed by a Sioux war party. For
some strange and unknown reason,
the Indians did not rob him or scalp
him , but crossed his hands peacefully
on his breast and put his
Bible in them.

The Railroad Raider
ON THE morning of April 12,
1862, a train stopped at Marietta,
G a., en route from Atlanta to
Chattanooga. An unusually large
number of men passengers came
aboard, claiming they were refugees
from within the Yankee lines
and wanting to join the Confederate
forces.
When the train stopped at Big
Shanty for breakfast, Jam es J . Andrews,
a citizen from Flemingsburg,
Ky., and one of the large party of
alleged refugees, cut away all but
three cars, climbed into the cab and
steamed away.
Capt. W. A. Fuller, who was ln
charge of the train, dashed to the
telegraph office to warn the station
agents up the lin«t but found that the
telegraph wires had been cut. Andrews
really was the leader of a
group of Union soldiers in civilian
clothes who started out to paralyze
traffic on the Western and Atlantic
railroad—one of the vital arteries
of Confederate transport.
Captain Fuller got a handcar and
I with a couple of men started in
| pursuit. But Andrews burned 15
| bridges, pulled up many sections of
track and placed several obstacles
along the right of way, all while
keeping ahead of his pursuers who
finally abandoned the handcar when
they were able to board a locomotive.
About to be overtaken, Andrews
set fire to the last freight car, left
it on ■ bridge and ran into the
woods with his crew. Mounted m ilitia
finally captured all of Andrews’
party and he, with several others,
w u executed as a spy.

under a bill introduced in the assem
bly by Reno Trego, Merrill Progres
sive.
The tax has been a minor bone o
contention because many claim it i
boomerang and say it causes a boycott
of Wisconsin-made products in other
states. Governor Heil has been quoted
as being opposed to such “state trade
barrier” taxes.
Trego said his bill was introduced
at the request of S. J. Gwidt, Rhine
lander, former assemblyman, who
claimed a number of paper mills
around Green Bay and Rhinelander
were suffering cancelled contracts
the south as a retaliation against the
tax. Trego added that a wire fence
company at Janesville recently re
ceived a cancellation of a large order
from a southern state as soon as
was discovered that the fence was
made in Wisconsin.
The present law imposes a 15 cents
per pound tax on oleomargarine and
an occupational tax on all concerns
using or selling the products.

On School Boards:
More important to a town than
modernized store fronts and paved
streets is its school board. When there
is to be a school board election every
voter in town should get out and vote!
In the hands of three people who comprise
the school board is concentrated
a great deal of power in shaping the
citizens of tomorrow.
1. W’ith the school board rests the
responsibility of maintaining the
school plant with the problems of heat,
light, ventilation, supplies, ad infinitum.
Inadequate heat, improper ventilation,
defective lighting are important
in the health of the children. In
one very fine school building, there
was an epidemic of fainting among
the senior girls in the first period class
and investigation proved the ventilating
system in that particular class
room to be at fault.
2. With the school board rests the
very important duty of hiring teachers.
Well do we know how vastly a
teacher with personality influences
the thinking and development of our I
youth—be it for good or bad. How
very important, then, that the school
hoard be able to select teachers of
high moral and intellectual ability.
The men who advocate low salaries
and a cheap teaching staff in order to
cut down operating expenses of the
school are not necessarily good economists.
Too often they sacrifice
standards for dollars.
I heard once of a school board who
wanted to hire a "bargain-teacher”
for their one-room school. One day a
woman applied for the position and
made the extravagant boast that if she
were hired it would be unnecessary to
purchase a much needed dictionary.
The parsimonious school board hired
her. On the first day of school a boy
raised his hand. “Teacher, what is
this word?’* he queried.
“ Spell it,” she commanded.
“V o c a b u 1 a r y,” he spelled.
“Voca bullary,” promptly said the
teacher, “That’s a machine to dehorn
cattle with.”
Yes, indeed, she was cheap but what
havoc and confusion she cost before
she was through with a year of teaching.
3. Then the school hoard has to view
the school as a community social institution
run for all the children of the
community and not a private school
for the accommodation of any one
group. The members of the school
board must have the interest of every
single child at heart.
Every member of any school board
should preferably be a person of
sound judgment and common sense;
one who is able to keep his own finances
in order; (no one who is unable to
run his own business affairs will be
able to handle public funds efficiently).
Let him be a person who has the
courage of his convictions. One who
cannot “ take punishment” should
never run for a public office bccause
every one in public life is bound to be
the target of many cruel and often untrue
criticisms. And when we have
elected our school board, let us in turn
be loyal in our support of them. We
may do well to remember that they
are rendering the community a real
public service and giving freely many,
many hours of their time etch year.

and Mrs. Raymond Schulz, of Wausau,

Pilots Defeat Badgers
Strong was not able to stop the
Pilots Sunday and finally retired after
the sixth inning in favor of Sousek.
Krull pitched a masterful game all
the way, holding the Badgers to four
scattered hits, and striking out twelve.
Vance was the big gun in the W ittenberg
attack with a double and a
triple, and also turned in a beautiful
play to catch Hempel at home.
A win for W'ittenberg next Sunday
will mean the league leadership. The
Pilots will have a tough game on their
hands when they face Wausau with
Hoag on the mound.
Fans, don’t miss this game, help
boost the Pilots. A win Sunday may
mean the championship.

Just a Word to Berry Pickers
Lloyd Cady, who will be absent from
his home a few miles east of town for
some time on a job he has near Bowler,
has asked The Enterprise to say foi
him that he will not care if people pick
berries on his place provided they are
considerate enough to leave, say, a
quarter »t the house for the privilege.
It is worth more but he will be satisfied
with that kind of a coin.

In loving memory of our dear husband
and father, son and brother, Edward
Johnson, who passed away a
year ago, on July 6, 1938.
He little thought when leaving home
He would return no more.
That he in death so sotfn would sleep
And leave us here to mourn.
We do not know what pains he bore,
We did not see him die.
We only know he passed away
And could not say “Goodbye.”
In the graveyard, softly sleeping.
Where the flowers love to wave,
Lies the one we loved so dearly
In his silent grave.
In our hearts there comes a longing
If he only could come home!
His happy face for us to see.
To hear his voice and see him smile.
Sadly missed by

H E A D L I N E S F R O M THE LI VES
OF P EOP L E LI KE Y O U K S E L f l
“A Dog’s Life”
He l l o e v e r y b o d y :
Today’s Distinguished Adventurer didn't write his own
story. He can neither read nor write.
That, of course, is nothing new in the realm of adventure.
Plenty of great adventurers couldn’t as much as sign their own
names, but that didn't stop them from getting into tight spots or
from living lives that were packed full of thrills and danger.
And it’s the thrills and the danger we want in this column. I
don’t give a whoop how well you can write, or whether you can
write at all. The writing part of it is my job, and all I want you
boys and girls to do is give me the facts. Write ’em down on an
old piece of wrapping paper, or if you can’t write, get somebody
else to write 'em down for you.
That’s what today’s Distinguished Adventurer did. His
name, by the way, is Jip. He is one-half foxhound and onehalf
pointer, and he’s one of the best all-around bird and rabbit dogs in
the state of Illinois.
J ip ’s boss, Newton Belgum, of Chicago, sent me all the dope about
J i p ’s adventure. Newt raised J ip from a pup, and he was right there
when things began to happen. It was on a cold day in December, 1933,
and Newt and Harry Russell and F ran k Blackford were off on a hunting
trip along the Kaskaskia river near Sullivan, 111. Newt, of course, had
J ip with h im .
After Breakfast They Started for the River.
They arrived in Sullivan about four o’clock in the morning, had breakfast
and started for the river. It was a bitter cold morning, with the m e rcury
down to five below.
Newton was hunting through a cornfield, when suddenly he heard •
yell that came from the river.
There was Jip . swirling about in the ley water. He had become
thirsty and started out to get a drink, but the thin ice near
the edge had broken and he had fallen in.
The three men stood on the bank and looked helplessly at one another.
There wasn't a thing they could do for Jip , so they stood watching
On the bank while the game little an im a l did his best to help himself.
The current was strong at that spot. Already it had carried h im down
from some point farther up the river. Now it was tugging at t..e poor
And then Newt bad another idea.
Bring at the ice.
He loaded his gun and began
“ Has she a good style and address?”
"R ig h t there with the style, but 1
really d id n 't notice any dress."
C.oings and Comings
She was putting in a few Rood
words on her young m an 's behalf.
Father, however, was not to be
coaxed.
"N o , no and again, no,” he said
repeatedly.
"B u t, father,” she persisted, "you
must m ake some allowances for
Henry's shortcomings.”
" I 'm not kicking about his shortcomings,”
said the parent, “ what
I don't like is his long stayings.”
“ Do you call Tugville a city ?”
“ Wo do. Aren't we constantly
having trouble with our schools,
water works and bus service?”
I little anim al, trying to p ull h im away from the bank and whirl h im out
l into the stream.
Gamely. Jip tackled the ice with his paws. He broke it for
about five feet toward shore, but he couldn't clim b up on it when
It became too thick to break.
Again and again the current pulled h im out. Each time he managed
to swim back. But already he had been in that icy water for 10 minutes,
and he couldn't keep on fighting that current forever.
And all that time, Newt, standing up on the bank, was going through
a hell that was almost as bad as the one his dog was fighting.
“ Each time J ip fought his way back to the little cut he had
made in the ice,” Newt says, “ he would look up at us with appealing
eyes, as if he were trying to say, ‘For God's sake, save m e !’
"B y this time I was bewildered and desperate. I wanted to
try to go out on the ice, but the other fellarvs told me it would be
suicide and reminded me that I had three daughters at heme
depending on me.
“ As I stood there, watching h im flght for his life, I felt as though the
whole world was going to pieces. To F ran k and Harry I said, ‘Fellows,
he's done for, and I ca n ’t go home without h im .'
They Started to Gather Up the Dead Branches.
"F in a lly I hit on an idea. We started gathering up all the dead
branches we could find and throwing them into the water, hoping the
current would drive them back of my dog, giving his hind legs something
to kick against and enabling him to clim b up on the ice."
But that idea of Newt's d id n 't work. The current was in the wrong
direction. Jip had been in the water for 15 minutes by that time.
“ There was Ice on his eyebrows and nose,” Newt says. “ I
couldn't stand it any longer so I went back and got my shotgun.
I was going to shoot h im and put him out of his misery, but my
friends stopped me—told me not to shoot h im as long as he bad a
fighting chance.”
And then Newt had another idea. He loaded h it gun and began firing
at the ice!
J ip was out in the stream again, fighting h ii way back. The first
shot ripped out a chunk of ice, lengthening the cut J ip had already started.
Newt fired again—and again—and then the other two men got the idea.
Newt was blasting a channel in the ice so the dog could swim closer to the
bank! They picked up their own guns and started to help.
They cut that channel almost to the shore. J im swam Into It,
but still he conldn’t get his hind legs up on the Ice. Then
Newt had another Idea. AU three men fired at once at the Ice on
the npstream side of the dog. That did the trick. A big, triangular
piece of ice, half sunken In tbe water, floated down and got under
Jip 's hind legs, and J ip kicked himself up to safety.
They called J ip down to a spot where the bank was lower, and then
went and got him. The poor pup was all in. His tail was frozen stiff by an
icicle. He was cut and bleeding, and there was ice on his face and ears.
Newt put his coat around h im and rubbed him until he could stand

Bowler Hat, or ‘Derby,’ Designed by Farmer
in London some 140 years ago. When
he first wore it he was arrested for
inciting a riot; the complaint wa;
m ade that tim id persons wer«
frightened by its sheen. A century
ago a Frenchman, Antoine Gibus
contributed the opera hat spring
This is the only successful mechan
ical device in the hat business, and
the inventor’s fam ily receives roy
alties from it. High hats aro all
made by hand.
The bowler hat, known in this
country as the derby, got its British
name through having first been
| m ade more than 60 years ago by
W illiam Bowler of St. Swithin's lane
to the design of a Norfolk farmer.
The bowler or derby is popular in
Britain and has many adherents
here. The bowler is a symbol of
solidity. The high silk hat represents
lofty social standing. John
Hetherington invented the “ topper"

l i LY 15 is the proudest day in J American maritime history. On
that day the “America." new flagship
for the United States lines
and largest liner to he built in this
country, slides down the ways at
Newport Neus. How is a modern
steamship b uilt? These
pictures tell the story.
Above: Scale drawings of
each plate on the “ America"
were made on a 15-
foot working model of the
hu ll. These models were
used in making full-size
patterns of the plates.
Right: The man who welds
the plates electrically. Note
his Martian • looking helmet,
leather outersleeves
and heavy gauntlets, which
protect him day after day
from the fierce heat of his
welding apparatus.
The woman in the top-floor flat
signaled for a sack of coal, and the
coalman toiled laboriously up many
flights of stairs with his burden.
“ Since you are going down
em pty ," she said, "perhaps you
would take down my dustbin,” a
suggestion to which the coalman
gave an unwilling assent.
"A n d there’s a big box here full of
rubbish, too. Perhaps you wouldn’t
m ind—”
“ Not at all, missus,” intervened
the coalman. “ I was wonderin’, too,
if you had a brush with a long handle
which I could tie to my waist,
and I'd brush your stairs for you
as well on my way down.”
Proof Positive
To the surprise of the magistrates,
and especially of the official concerned,
the prisoner in the dock
called the police superintendent us
his witness as to character.
"B u t I don’t even know the m an ,”
complained the “ super” indignantly.
“ And that,” returned the prisoner,
smiling at the Bench, “ is my proof
of respectability. I ’ve lived in this
‘one-horse’ town for five years and
the police don’t even know m e ."

to an old farmer, “ your methods of
cultivation are 100 years behind the

around h im , " I ’d be surprised if you
made $50 out of the oats in that

“ So would I , ” said the farmer,

A slice of golden-yellow cheese
with a time-mellowed sharpness of
flavor is the perfect accompaniment
for a piece of rich, juicy, apple pie
—but all too often we forget that ita
usefulness doesn't stop there. There
are so m any varieties of cheese,
and so many uses for each, that
menu making with thia versatile
food is fun.
There are rich, full-flavored
cheeses, cheeses with a tempting
sharpness of flavor, and delicate,
m ild cheeses—cheeses to suit every
taste, and for every use, from appetizer
to dessert.
Because cheese is high in food
value and comparatively low in
cost, meals built
around it are nutritious
and economical,
too. And
if you’re feeding
a family that
won’t drink milk,
remember that
serving cheese is
an excellent way of getting more
m ilk into the diet, for most cheese
is concentrated whole m ilk (or m ilk
which has been partially skimmed).
This group of cheese recipes,
which I ’ve found temptingly delicious,
will help you to plan meals
that are different and very good to
eat. There are new flavor combinations—
the sharp tang of mustard
added to the mellow taste of old
cheese, pungent chives with cottage
cheese, and an old favorite—ham
and eggs with richly flavored cheese
to bring out the best in both. These
recipes, which have been tested in
my own kitchen, are practical and
easy to use.
