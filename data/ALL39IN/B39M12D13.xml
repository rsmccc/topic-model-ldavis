         <p>BLACK RIVER FALLS
DRESSED FOR CHRISTMAS
The business section o f Black River
Falls is all dressed up for the holidays 
Men employed by the city were
busy fo r days putting up the decorations
o f hemlock which festoon the
many streets o f the town The strings
o f colored lights interwoven with
them and the stars in the center give
a holiday air to the green arches 
Each o f the lamp posts is also wound
with the greenery and topped with a
star and decorated with colored lights 
The plan is the same as employed last
year and which was so universally
admired by all It is doubtful if it
could be improved upon 
Not only the streets but the stores
and business houses are decorated
both inside and out The windows o f
business places attract the attention
o f all It is cheering to see the signs
o f Christmas the bright lights the
decorations upon the streets in the
stores and appearing throughout the
private homes o f the city The beautiful
display o f Christmas gifts that
may be seen in every window and
every store are enough to stir up the
spirit o f Christmas in the souls of
most o f us in spite o f the fact that
the weather is not at all wintry We
will probably have snow any o f these
days and then the Christmas feeling
will be here for sure 
Whether you want wearing apparel 
foodstuffs jewelry electrical devices 
hardware tops cars furniture sporting
goods or even a house or a farm
to give some one for a Christmas
gift you can find them right here in
Black River Falls Every store is
well stocked with bargains to fit
every purse 
Beginning this evening December
13th there will be a Santa Claus on
the streets and in the stores afternoons
and evenings who is being
sponsored by the business men He
will have treats for the children and
a cheery word for all Also beginning
this evening the stores with the exception
o f grocery and meat stores 
will be open every night for the rest
o f the week

Mr and Mrs Herman Stiehl have
been gravely concerned for some time
as to the whereabouts o f their oldest
son Horace and how he was They
had not heard from him for three
years When last they heard he was
in Colville Washington Although
they had often written there were no
replies to their letters They were
made even more anxious when a report
reached them that he had been
killed in a gas station holdup A
registered letter with a return receipt
received no reply That was sent late
in August Mr and Mrs Stiehl get
their mail in a mailbox near their
home in the vicinity o f Rock Spring
Park Right beside their box is another
that is not used The other
day their little granddaughter who
makes her home with them went for
the mail and idly opened and looked
into the unused box There was a
card dated September 3rd signed by
their son in response to the registered
letter they had sent him Their
relief may be imagined to learn that
he was alive and apparently all right
and that the only trouble in not hearing
from him had been carelessness 
It is too bad that boys who are away
from home forget how important
hearing from them is to their parents

DURING TH E H O LIDAYS
Declaring that holidays are hazarddays 
County T raffic Officer Bemie
A Finch today warned Jackson county
motorists and pedestrians to be especially
careful during December 
Safety workers and law enforcement
officers throughout Wisconsin
are cooperating with the state motor
vehicle department safety division in
an effort to curb the number o f traffic
deaths this holiday season Longer
hours o f darkness slippery road surfaces
and bad weather conditions all
conspire with Old Man Winter to fill
this gay and festive season with danger
for those who walk and ride 
December daytime is shortened a
little more than three hours from
summer daytime Officer Finch points
out Most o f this extra darkness
comes when traffic is heaviest 
Icy or snowy roads put the motorist
on the skids In December last
year skids led to nine death dealing
crashes in Wisconsin Bad weather
demands more than ordinary caution 
Poor visibility is blamed for many
winter accidents Windshield wipers
kept in good working order will clean
away sleet snow and rain The motorist
also should keep a constant flow
o f fresh air into his car for fresh air
will drive out carbon monoxide gas 
Thirty two o f the 84 persons killed
in December 1938 were pedestrians 
motor vehicle department statistics
reveal One met death while
picking up a Christmas tree on the
highway Another who was hit had
his coat collar up around the side o f
his face blocking full view o f traffic 
Three walkers were drunk 
Seven pedestrians were killed walking
with traffic on rural roads instead
o f facing oncoming cars Thirty five
persons killed in Wisconsin mishaps
last December were 50 years o f age
or older accident figures show Eleven
children were among the 84 traffic
fatalities this month a year ago

C O O P E R A T IV E NEW S
By Earl Horswill
England holds the distinction of
having the largest co operatives of
the world Sweden Co ops are noted
for their trust busting powers but
Finland is noted for a nation where
35 to 40 per cent o f the trade is carried
on co operatively a country
where unemployment and poverty has
ceased to exist a people noted for
doing things for themselves through
cooperative efforts A country that
does more co operative business per
capita than any other nation in the
world A country that has lifted itself
up from a position o f oppression
and servitude to a place o f prominence
that is admired and respected by
the nations o f the world All o f
which has been brought about through
co operation No other nation can
show more distinctive marks as to
what co operation will do for a country
and its people than Finland A
northern country with nearly half o f
it north o f the Arctic circle poor
soil few natural resources but inhabited
by a hardy people 
Little is known o f the history o f
the Finns prior to the middle o f the
12th century It was then that the
Swedes undertook a series o f crusades
into Finland introducing Christianity
and gradually conquering the entire
I country For more than six centuries
j Finland and Sweden remained unit
 ed However in all these 600 years
I there was never any very long periods
o f peace The Finns took a prominent
part in the many foreign wars of
the Swedish Kings and besides had to
bear the brunt o f the constant warfare
between Sweden and Russia At
the downfall o f Napoleon Norway
was taken from Denmark and united
with Sweden as compensation for Finland
which was taken from Sweden
and joined to Russia entering the
Russian Empire as an Autonamous
Grand Duchy This signified the beginning
o f Finland s existence as a
fully organized state with its own
laws and institutions administered by
Finnish officials 
In 1898 the late Czar o f Russia
inaugurated a repressive policy aiming
at the thorough Russification of
Finland and this was ruthlessly pursued
until on Dec 9 1917 Finland
proclaimed its independence Early
the next year a Civil war broke out 
The situation was much the same as
in Spain in 1936 37 A liberal working
class government was in power 
The owning class saw its ancient
power threatened and feared a worker
state similar to that then forming in
Russia would be created Hence the
upper class revolted A short sharp
war ensued in which the working class
was victorious The time for crushing
the rebellion was materially shortened
bv the aid extended by Germany
and on July 17 1919 Finland
adopted a republican form o f government 
The year 1899 marked the beginning
for Finland o f something else
apart from organized tyranny for
that year witnessed the real birth of
a Finnish Co operative movement 
With 430 members and $40 000 it
commenced the pioneering work upon
which the present structure o f Finland s
co operation is built 
Wholesale Co operation was bom in
1904 when 12 consumer societies
formed the Finnish Co operative
Wholesale By 1928 ten wholesales
were operating doing a business o f
over $75 000 000 annually 
Social democracy was becoming a
political power in the land Among its
leading Parliamentary representatives
was a young man o f 26 named Vano
Tanner He was destined in later
years to be not only Finland s Prime
Minister but president o f the International
Co operative Alliance as
well 
Today the co operatives make great
efforts to overcome all competition by
increasing efficiency building attractive
shops and by systematic and
able education The movement has
269 societies with a membership of
661 000 The life and existence of
this little democracy is threatened for
Stalin is on the march history is being
made By land sea and air the
mighty Soviet war machine is striking
at tiny Finland whose out numbered
but well equipped army is resisting
stubbornly World opinion all the
way from Fascist Rome to Democratic
Washington is sympathetic to
the Finns 
 A Mrs Myrtle Phillips o f Humbird 
was greatly surprised Sunday when
32 friends and relatives stepped in
with well filled baskets to celebrate
her 55th birthday The two daughters 
in law baked the birthday cakes 
The children were all home but one 
who lives in Mondovi and was unable
to attend Many useful gifts were
left the honored guest

Soil Management
Five important principles in soil
management which he regards as necessary
to produce good yields o f
quality crops were outlined by Emil
Truog head o f the soils department
o f the Wisconsin College o f Agriculture 
These conditions which likewise
are fundamental to good farming call
for conditions over which farmers can
exercise considerable control include
conserving the moisture supply providing
plant food liming and other
important factors 
Toward conserving moisture Truog
suggests that farmers can do much by
keeping down weeds by decreasing
run off and by encouraging the deep
rooting o f plants Enormous amounts
o f water are used by plants he points
out In the case o f alfalfa 700 tons
o f water are used for every ton of
dry alfalfa hay harvested This
amounts to six inches o f rainfall to
the acre for each ton o f alfalfa Corn
uses about half that amount 
Soils in time become acid and to
correct this acidity lime should be
added when needed Truog explains
that lime supplies calcium and magnesium 
Liming helps to make more
available such elements as prosphorus
and nitrogen and favors the growth
o f legumes A fter liming he explains 
that the organic matter o f the
soil which helps the soil hold water
and serves as a storehouse for plant
food can be built up by adding barnyard
manure or by plowing under
green manuring crops 
To increase the nitrogen and the
organic matter o f the soil Truog suggests
growing legumes whenever possible 
particularly the more valuable
ones such as alfalfa and clovers A
season s growth o f alfalfa on one acre
may fix into the soil as much as ten
dollars worth o f the nitrogen which
it takes from the air 
Even under good farming Truog
finds that the supplies o f available
nitrogen phosphorus and potassium
usually become used up so that both 
from the standpoint o f producing
crops and conserving the soil it is necessary
that these be added in commercial
form It has been discovered
recently he reports that in some soils
one or more o f the so called minor
elements as boron manganese which
are important elements for legume
crops are absent

LIONS CLUB A P P R E C IA T E S
PATR O N AG E A T LECTURES
The Lions club desires to thank
the public for the patronage given to
the lecture and round table discussion
program which was sponsored by the
club A series o f eight meetings was
held and all who attended the lectures
were more than pleased with
what they derived from them and felt
the cost to them was money well
spent 
It is felt by many that the public
forum system should become a permanent
part o f the community activities 
possibly as a part o f the school
system The action o f the Lions club
in sponsoring the movement this year
was an initial step toward showing
the possibilities o f such a program

Perhaps no word in language appeals
so much to the finer sensibilities
o f mankind as the name o f Mother 
The very name itself comes to us
laden with inexpressible air o f sweetness
divine and a charm which makes
it seem a gale from heaven itself 
We shall not attempt in this short
message to magnify her virtues arid
good qualities To say she has done
her part well is expressing it mildly 
The crowning virtue o f her womanhood 
and the charm and beauty o f
her spotless character will always best
reveal itself to her family In this
relation o f service as expressed in the
thousand and one cares and duties
pressing in upon her from day to day
was the supreme object to please her
husband and rear her children aright 
The constant and unremitting care
and tender love and sympathy for us
are only a few o f life s holy memories 
Our minds go back with holy
reverence to the happy days o f our
childhood 
And with the poet we will say 
 Backward turn backward Oh Time
in your flight 
Make me a child again just for tonight 
Mother come back from the echoless
shore
And take me again to your arms as
o f yore 
Over my slumbers your loving watch
keep 
Rock me to sleep Mother rock me
to sleep ***

TEXACOS SWAMP
GREENWOOD 65 TO 19
Ray Button s Texaco Oil quintet
knocked on Greenwood with the
greatest o f ease at the high school
gym here last Tuesday night winning
by 65 to 19 The boys started off
by pitching 21 points through the
draperies in the first quarter Green
wood meanwhile counting only a free
toss The reserves boosted the count
to 36 to 10 at half time 
In the 3rd chapter the regulars
went back in and shot the count up
to 51 the enemy capturing 9 more
counts for themselves Greenwood
went scoreless in the final period but
the wild and woolly Texacos added 14
more 
Unless one had a bent for the violent
the game lacked much in the way
o f interest it being largely a rehearsal
for future games with the Black
River Falls Cokes and the Taylor
 Bearcats who in the past have been
obsessed with the idea that they could
give the Texacos an interesting ball
game Let it be said that the Merrillan
basketeers have been waiting
an opportunity to put both these
spuads in their proper places and
are scheduled to start the Cokes 
off on their wrong foot tonite (Thursday)
Taylor will come later in the
season

O LYM PIAN COEDS
PUT ON NICE SHOW
Miss Helen Stephans and her Olympian
Co eds offered a pleasant diversion
from the routine schedule o f the
Merrillan Texaco Oilers at the high
school gym here Monday night Dec 
11 Naturally the gays being the
weaker sex the famous guests took a
spanking from the powerful Texacos
by 65 to 31 but the game was highly
interesting throughout despite the
masculine superiority especially since
the males wished to sustain their reputation
and avoid embarrassment 
However we know o f a number of
men teams which Miss Stephans ball
club would dish out a licking to 
Featured o f course on the program
was the Olympian star who between
halves gave an informal interview 
recounted her Olympic experiences
and gave a brief autobiography
o f her track and field work One
gentleman was so unchivalrous as to
ask the ladies age and believe it or
not was given a courteous answer 
Miss Payne introduced Miss Stephens 
Most o f the scoring for the Co eds
was divided between a blond lady
named White who tossed ten markers
through the hoop and a little Indian
girl entitled Onson The latter named
was a breath o f beauty from Oklahoma
and was drawing plenty o f basso
profundo cheers from gentlemen who
had left their wives at home The
pulchriturinous little rascal was a
dead eye dick on her shots and bracketed
a total o f 15 points by way o f 7
fielders and a gift shot Izzy Payne
also gave the folks a thrill when she
dunked a bucket from two thirds the
length o f the gym The low ceiling
interfered with most o f her distance
shots and served to keep the score for
the gals down Anyway the game
was viewed with a lot of fun for all
and the biggest crowd to attend an independent
basket ball game here in
years enjoyed every moment o f program 
 Bob Rhoades who this season
has been inspired with a new fire lead
the Merrillan attack with 18 followed
close by Hayden who caged seven
doubles Barritt was next with 10 
Rhoades is looking better every game
and the new fight he has put into his
basket ball has made him one o f the
most dangerous scoring threats in this
neck o f the woods His scrap has
boosted him to the top o f the Texaco
scoring heap with a total o f 53
for four games Osborn the new addition
to the locals is also rapidly establishing
himself as one o f the cleverest
cagers to wear the Merrillan
colors in years Chuck was the victim
o f many undergraduate razzberries
during the co ed melee and was blushing
himself a nice rosy red during
the time he was in the ball game 
Merrillan and the high school are
justly proud o f their new coach 
Games have been arranged with the
All Star Globe trotters and the Sioux
Indians for later in the season Both
games will be properly advertised in
the near future

M ERRILLAN VICTORIO U S
Last Friday night Merrillan went
over to Blair to come home with a
victory Last year our team was beat
by Blair and even though the team
over there has an advantage o f being
taller we were determined to win 
Merrillan took the lead at the beginning
o f the game and held it The
high point man was Robert Heath
with 10 points the rest shared equally 
The height o f folly that night was
Tom Corrigan Crago who neatly
caught the ball and whirling tossed
it into their basket contributing a
point Oh well it all turned out well 
giving a good start by winning our
first conference game 
This Friday night we play Taylor
on the home floor so be sure and attend

MERLIN HULL S LETTE R
The President is not inclined to recall
our ambassador to Russia at this
time He acknowledges that the sentiment
favoring the severance o f o fficial
relations is very strong as the
people become more and more aroused
over the invasion o f Finland but
he states that the presence o f our
ambassador at Moscow in the crisis
is as much or more important to our
nation than it is to Russia In a
word it means that our State Department
de sires to keep informed as to
what is going on in Russia and by
recalling our minister and his staff 
such information may be difficult to
obtain How Russia feels about his
attitude is not known Possibly it desires
to keep its embassy at Washington
also for the purpose o f learning
what is the re action o f the American
people to the ruthless and unscrupulous
tactics o f the Russian dictator 
Unable to officially embargo shipments
o f war materials to Russia the
President has established a moral 
embargo to stop at least some such
materials He has requested the industries
and firms making air planes
to make no sales o f planes or parts
to that country Russian agents have
purchased more than one million dollars
worth o f parts in the past few
weeks They have been traveling extensively
over the country to place
further orders particularly for wooden
propellers and the materials from
which they are made The supply o f
wood for such propellers is limited almost
entirely to our west coast section 
Russia has immense forests but
it has not been able to discover timber
o f the quality needed for this particular
purpose There are other
woods used for plane propellers but
they fail to stand the stress o f war
conflict Probably most o f the warplanes
o f all European countries are
propelled by this excellent quality of
materials from our coast forests Russia
will have at least that part o f its
equipment cut off 
The supply o f propeller material is
so limited even here that Congress has
considered measures o f prohibiting its
sales abroad Japan has been among
those making large purchases o f it 
Congress failed to act There are
many large firms profiting handsomely
from the sale o f the material as
well as the finished product and naturally
they oppose curtailment o f
their profits The President s action
as to shipments to both countries may
again bring the matter to the front
so forcibly that Congress may forego
further protection to the profits o f
the trade and protect our own future
interests by at least limiting exports 
Aside from those who are finding
such an item o f foreign trade very
lucrative probably there are few who
wish to have any pride in the fact
that the planes bombing the people
o f Finland including women and children 
are aided in their devastating
and murderous work by propellers
made in America 
The victory o f the milk monopolies
which largely control the sale and distribution
o f milk and milk products in
Chicago in the lower courts has been
short lived The grand jury brought
in indictments against 93 firms individuals
and city officials o f that city
for violation o f the Sherman Anti 
Trust law The Department o f Justice 
which had spent months o f time
and a larere amount o f money to bring
about the indictments made ready for
trial o f the defendants last summer 
It had scarcely opened when the trial
court threw the cases out o f court
for insufficiency o f the indictments 
and particularly found that such monopolies 
even if guilty as charged 
were not within the scope o f the antitrust
law 
The wide spread monopolistic corporations 
largely controlling the milk
supply o f all the larger cities o f the
country hailed the decision as practically
placing all their operations beyond
interference by the Justice department
and by the courts The Supreme
Court handed down its decision
by a unanimous vote over ruling the
Chicago court and ordering prosecution
upon the indictments to proceed 
In a few weeks the government will
again take up the cases and the Supreme
court decision leaves the defendants
almost without grounds for
defense The rejoicing o f the big
milk combinations has turned to lamentations
as their press agents send
out new stories about government
interference with business Farmers
and consumers who have been taxed
billions by the monopolies will not be
disturbed by the interference in that
kind o f business 
Other cities also are promised relief
from the exactions o f the milk
trust The Department is carrying on
investigations in many o f them including
Washington where plain buttermilk
retails at 12 cents per quart
and whole milk at 14 The opinion
o f the Supreme Court written by
Chief Justice Hughes backed by the
entire court so clarifies the law that
it will be easier to obtain indictments
and prosecution o f offenders than
ever before 
The National Economic Committee 
which has made an exhaustive study
o f the ramifications o f the milk monopolies 
states that only two corporations 
holding companies controlling
agencies throughout the country 
completely dominate the supply of
milk in the principal markets with
three other such corporations aiding
and abetting in the conspiracy to their
own great profit 
The National Dairy Products Company
alone purchases 45 per cent o f
the cheese made in the country as
well as being an importer o f much o f
the foreign cheese That organization 
in existence only 15 years but
with assets above $200 millions and
the Borden Company are the two
alleged to be in the control not only
o f th j whole milk supply but also o f
the markets for ice cream and other
manufactured forms o f the dairy
products The National Dairy is said
to own 06 subsidiary corporations including
77 engaged in the manufacture
o f dairy products It also is
said to operate through smaller organizations 
numerous large dairy

CARD OF TH AN KS
We wish to thank our friends for
their kindness and sympathy during
the illness and upon the death o f our
son and brother Fred Jacobs We
thank the neighbors from Shamrock 
Charter Oak and Alma township for
their flowers and kindness 
Mr and Mrs John Jacobs
Roy and Ruby Jacobs
CARD OF TH AN KS
We are deeply grateful to our
friends for their kindness shown us
and the many expressions o f sympathy
upon the death o f our beloved
daughter and sister We thank those
who sent flowers and all for what
they did for us 
Mrs Anna Kubina and Family
plants in Canada including cheese
factories whence comes the importations
when the price for cheese
makes importation possible and profitable 
The Borden Company which
may be somewhat smaller in assets
and operations than National Dairy 
is alleged to be in such unofficial
collaboration with the latter that the
two not only exercise the usual monopoly
control o f supply but also of
prices The Supreme Court has taken
a fall out o f these monopolies from
which they may not recover At least
there is reason to hope so

DECEMBER WEATHER
IN WISCONSIN
We have been having what you
might call wacky winter weather in
Wisconsin Wide open day after day
when it should be cold and getting
colder Instead o f snow plows we
could do nicely with street sprinkling 
There has been only once during
the month that there has been any
precipitation rain to you and that
was the first o f December when there
was a fall o f four tenths o f an inch 
It has not seemed a bit like holiday
weather but with 11 days to go we
may have what it takes yet 
Some idea o f the mild weather may
be obtained from the following temperatures
for the month obtained
from the official record at the Ranger
station Note our coldest day has
been 29 and the warmest 58

into 26 Wisconsin communities
this year as a part of its educational
campaign against this disease The
year round campaign against one of
man s worst disease enemies is made
possible through the annual sale of
Christmas Seals now in progress 
In these 26 communities in central
and northern Wisconsin the W A T 
A x ray clinic crew took over 2 200
x ray films o f patients brought in by
doctors county nurses and other
agencies The films were then sent
to the W A T A medical department
for interpretation A fter interpretation
reports of findings are sent
to the patients own doctors for further
care 
The x ray and consultation service
is one o f the regular services o f the
W A T A made possible through
funds raised during the Christmas
Seal Sale Last year association doctors
read and interpreted over 10 700
x ray films over 2 000 of which were
sent in by private physicians throughout
the state 
The x ray work is but a part of
the organized program which the W 
A T A conducts throughout the
year Christmas Seal funds make

THE COOKIE JAR
FARM ERS UNION NOTES
The Farmers Union meeting held at
Alma Center Friday night was well
attended aand there was a nice program 
Mr Hull gave a wonderful
talk He told us how badly we need
more Farmers Union members and he
surely knows with the experience he
has had trying to get farm bills thru
the House in Washington He also
told us the great benefit we would
receive from our egg and poultry setup
that the Farmers Union is trying
so hard to organize A committee was
elected at this meeting to get out and
get more Farmers Union members
and also get signers for the poultry
and egg association Fellow farmers
we are asking you in all good faith
to get behind this movement and when
these organizers come around to see
you don t give them the cold shoulder
as they will have plenty headaches
before they get the job done
anyway Help the farmers that are
trying to help you I want to say
to all the other Jackson county Locals 
get busy United we stand divided
we fall

The farmers have been plowing this
week! We catch ourselves looking at
the calendar again and again just to
make sure that our eyes aren t deceiving
us Surely such maivelous
weather can t last much longer yet
every morning the sun comes up in a
blaze o f glory and goes down at night
on a path o f gold Santa Claus is
going to think he landed in California
by mistake if this keeps up or the
robins are going to come back and
set up housekeeping as if it were
April instead of December Whoever
said Wisconsin was a land o f long
cold winters should come back and
take a look at us basking in September
breezes when we should be shoveling
snow

FAC U LTY PING PONG
The ping pong tournament which
was conducted by faculty was won by
Mr Burch Second place went to
Miss Courtier third place to Mr Fonstad 
and fourth place to Mr Janisch 
It was a lot o f fun if reports
are true Some o f the highlights 
The rest o f the teachers put up a
big howl because Mr Burch beat them
so badly They insist they be given a
ten point handicap in any future
games He on the other hand objects
on the grounds that they delib
erately let him win by big scores so
that they could soak him good in the
second round Miss Farrell found the
going too tough with her shoes on so
she tok them off and ran around in
her stocking feet Anything to win!
Miss Boles says that she could have
cleaned up any one o f the entire
group if she had wanted to but that
she felt sorry for the rest On the
other hand she challenges all comers
in the future just to prove her point 
Miss Courtier pulled a fast one and
used an illegal serve thruout the tournament
and no one was the wiser until
Mr Burch started checking up on
the rules Speaking o f crooks! Mr 
Fonstad insists that all he needs is
practice Don t we all
