FORTY-SEVENTH YEA R WITTENBERG, SHAWANO COUNTY, WISCONSIN, THURSDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1939 N U M B E R 4
Ask Supreme Court to Rule on
Highway Diversion
An Oshkosh trucking contractor,
Edwin Friedrich, has filed a petition
with the state supreme court as the
firrt step in legal action to halt diversion
of highway funds for general
state purposes.
The petition filed by a Milwaukee
attorney, counsel for the contractor
msks the right to bring an original
action in the name of the state to enjoin
Fred R. Zimmerman, secretary of
state, and John M. Smith, state treasurer,
from diverting highway fund?
for general state purposes.
The court is scheduled to hear the
petition Friday, December 8. I f the
court grants permission to bring in
the original action it will be called upon
to decide one of the most widely
publicized political issues of the present
time. The petition charges state
officials with “unlawfully diverting”
highway revenue. It further charges
that diversion has been practised by
former state administrations.
I f the supreme court should hear the
original action and would halt highway
diversion it may become necessary for
Governor Heil to call a special session
in order to enact new taxed.
Controversial Issue
The use of highway funds for general
state purposes is one of the most
controversial subjects in Wisconsin
political circles today. The subject
was frequently debated during the last
legislative session and was also a Republican
campaign issue.
Early in the legislative session
Governor Heil pointed out to the assemblymen
and senators in his budget
message that the state owed the high
wav department more than 25 million
dollars which had been used for purposes
other than highway construction
and highway maintenance. During the
last election campaign Republicans
deplored the tactics of previous ad
ministrations in using highway funds.
However, during the discussions on
tax measures there were a half dozen
proposals for legal diversion of highway
monies. Many legislators would
rather see highway construction cur
tailed in preference to enacting new
taxes. The failure of the legislature
to enact new taxes, other than the eiearette
tax, and the resulting budget
deficit now make it appear that unless
a special session of the legislature is
called to enact new taxes highway
money will again be used, even though
such proposals were voted down by
the legislators.
I t has been reported that Governor
Heil would not call a special session
He believes that new taxes can be
avoided by practising: rigid economy
in all state departments and state
functions and by curtailing highway
construction next year. The Governor
can legally do this by not signing
highway construction contracts. Cur
tailment of highway construction
would leave the highway money in the
general state fund.
County Civil Service
Civil service examinations to be
given for all of the 71 county pension
departments in Wisconsin are nowbeing
prepared by the state bureau of
personnel.
A new federal law provides that
pension departments must be under
civil service by the first of the year.
The state law providing for the
change, however, was included in the
old age pension bill, the constitutionality
of which will soon be decided by
the state supreme court. The gover
nor vetoed certain sections of the bill
signed others. Secretary of State
Fred Zimmerman refused to permit
the transfer of pension funds, arguing
that the partial veto of the bill after
adjournment of the legislature made
the entire bill void.
The law, which gives the personnel
bureau authority to do the work for
the counties, provides that present
pension department employees who
have been working for six months can
take the tests regardless of their qual
ifications, and that if they pass the
examinations they keep their jobs.
Local county residents will be given
preference over residents of other
counties in job distributions.

Rev. Alvin Klug, of Shawano,
Accepts Call to Ix>cal Church
Word was received here this week
that the Rev. Alvin Klug, assistant
pastor at St. James church in Shawano
for some time, has accepted the call to
serve St. Paul’s Evangelical Lutheran
church in this village, succeeding the
Rev. George Fierke, who recently resigned
to serve a charge in Frederic
and left for that place a few weeks
ago. The new pastor and his wife
have notified the congregation that
they expect to move here next week.
The date of his installation, which will
undoubtedly take place in the near
future, will be announced in a later
issue.

As 1939 marks the 40th year of the
graduating classes of the Wittenberg
High School, it was thought that a
reunion of all classes should be held;
to celebrate this event.
A mass meeting of all the alumni
was held after the basket ball game
Friday evening in the new gymnasium
for the purpose of organizing. Principal
L. E. Peterson called the meeting
to order and asked for nominations for
a chairman. Dorothy Gates, Kenneth
Schlytter and Harold Kusserow were
nominated. After the third close ballot
Harold Kusserow was elected temporary
chairman.
Chairman Kusserow took the floor
and immediately started to organize
the proposed new organization. He
appointed R. G. Peterson temporary
secretary to take care of all preliminary
minutes until a permanent organization
could be perfected, if it is the
desire of the alumni to perfect such
an organization. This will be decided
upon at our “ Ruby Jubilee” which will
be held on Dec. 26th, 1939.
Chairman Kusserow called for an
appropriate name for this event and
several good suggestions were offered,
most of which seemed to favor the
“ Ruby Jubilee” .
Next in order was the date to be
selected and second day Christmas
was the choice of the majority.
Next thing to be decided was the
type of celebration and a tentative
proposal was offered to open with a
plate lunch in the new gymnasium,
basket ball games between former
alumni teams, short program, and
finish with a dance.
Chairman Kusserow appointed Ruth
Johnson, Carol Johnson, Allen Kersten
and R. G. Peterson to act on a working
committee with himself. This committee
to appoint other members to assist
in whatever work was necessary to
put on the celebration.
After a short discussion the meeting
adjourned.
At a meeting of the committee held
Tuesday evening, December 5, at
Hotel Moderne, Chairman Kusserow |
appointed the following committees:

By a 24-23 score the local cagers
upset Mattoon in their first conference
game last Friday evening. A good
crowd was on hand to witness a thrilling
game with the lead changing hands
several times. The local boys in their
anxiety to get a good start committed
several fouls early in the game. In
the second half they seemed to lose
their nervousness and came through
with a sparkling finish.
Due either to an oversight or lack
of interest on the part of the Mattoon
coaches their secondary teams did not

Apartments in Kersten’s Hall T" Be (:iven a ‘ ,he. " ! Kh S1f h 'K>1
_________ i Gymnasium Next Thursday
Fred Kersten has begun the work
of transforming his hall into sevenroom
apartments. As a beginning he
is making two apartments in the west
29H feet of the hall and these will be
modern in every respect with the walls
and ceilings clothed with Nu-wood in
pleasing colors. The apartments will
be steam-heated and equipped with
modern lighting and plumbing fixtures
Later on Mr. Kersten intends to put
in several more apartments in the
hall. Eventually he expects to have
all of the space of the hall turned into
apartments. Since the hall is 18 feet
high he will have space for an extra
floor, which will also be partioned into
apartments and rooms.
The greater part of the floor space
in the hall will remain available for
rental purposes for some time, as for
dartball games, shows, dances, and so
forth.
BIDS ARE LET ON
NEW REA PROJECT
Evening
The annual operetta will be given
by the students of the Wittenberg
Public School in the school gymnasium
next Thursday evening, December 14.
“The Magic Nutcracker” by Jane Kerley
is to be presented at this time.
This operetta is based upon the music
from an old and familiar score, “The
Nutcracker Suite” by Tschaikowsky,
and the story centers about the activities
which take place in an average
American family just before Christmas
Eve.
In connection with the operetta the
high school Mixed Choir and a number
of grade school children, in the role of
choir boys, will appear between the
acts in a candlelight concert of Christmas
carols.
Because of the extensive planning
and preparation on the part of students
and teachers and the cooperation
of the parents in making costumes,
we urge the public to attend
this Christmas program. Tickets may
be obtained either from students or at
the door. Prices, 25 and 10 cents.
First curtain will go up promptly at
7:45.
le ad ing roles in the operetta will be
taken by the following persons:

INTERNATIONAL:
Peace in the Wind
Though Nazi mines and submarines
counted almost two score victims
in 10 days (including Poland’s
huge Pilsudski and B ritain’s Rawalpindi),
though the allies reportedly
downed 22 Nazi planes in 48 hours,
the big news of Europe’s war was
not conflict. Instead it was the story
of peace efforts, of one mediation
after another, of European and
American overtures first to make
peace and then to m aintain it.
Venlo  Munich
By adding facts and subtracting
propaganda, neutral observers
pieced together a plausible solution
to the Sherlock Holmes mysteries
which burst into headlines after
Adolf Hitler “ escaped” the Munich
beer hall explosion November 8.
Heinrich H im m le r’s Gestapo merely
told Germans and the w’orld that
H IM M L E R AND H IT L E R
Where does Goering stand?
two British intelligence officers—
Capt. Richard Stevens and Maj.
Sigismund Best—had been seized for
aiding in the Munich explosion, for
which a German named Georg Elser
had subsequently been arrested.
By implication. H im m le r admitted
a m inor anti-Hitler movement in
G ermany, but by the time Netherlands
and Britain got through with
the story it looked like Hitler was
skating on thin ice.
At the Hague, the Dutch newspaper
Het Volk charged a Belgian
neutrality officer had been kilied November
9 when Best and Stevens
were abducted from Venlo, where
they had been carrying on peace negotiations
with “ anti-Hitler leaders”
from Germany. Identity of these
“ leaders” remained a mystery that
Heinrich Himmler would give his
right arm to solve, for many Germans
know he is a fervent Nazi
who looks suspiciously on Field Marshal
Hermann Goering as a potential
Hitler foe.
In B ritain it was claimed that
Georg Elser was merely a concentration
cam p prisoner who was
“ seized” for the record; that the
Munich bombing had really been
planned by H immler as an excuse
for making wholesale Nazi arrests
and thus weeding out revolutionists
—possibly including Herr Goering.
Whatever the true facts of Venlo,
Munich, Best, Stevens, Elser et al,
it was obvious Nazi Germany was
worried by an underground anti-Hitler
movement which has roots in
dissention following the wedding of
Nazidom and Communism.
V isionaries
Scattered generously in dispatches
from Washington and Europe have
been suggestions concerning the
peace to follow war. Few Englishmen
or Frenchmen now believe Versailles
was a just treaty; they now
hope to lick Hitler and give Germany
a rational post-war settlement.
Most important, there is growing
talk of a European confederation
whose units might include:
(1) Eastern Europeans, encompassing
nations from the Gulf of F in land
to Rum ania, with Poland dominant.
(2) Southeastern Europeans, allying
the Balkans to Italy.
(3) Central Europeans, drawing
the Catholic German, Czech and
Rhineland peoples nearer to France.
(4) Northern Europeans; an alliance
of Scandinavian countries.
(5) North Central Europeans, permitting
Austria and Sudetenland to
remain with the Reich.
Biggest visionary of the week was
none less than Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain: “ A war aim . . .
means defeat of our enemy, the defeat
of that aggressive, bullying
mentality . . . If the German people
can be convinced that spirit is
bad . . . they will abandon it . . .
When we have achieved our war
aims, we can establish a new E u rope,
a Europe with a new spirit
. . . In such a Europe it would be
recognized that there can be no lasting
peace unless there is a full and
constant flow of trade . . . In such
a Europe each country would have
the unfettered right to choose its
own form of internal government.”
American Hand
At Washington the state department
found the cause of international
peace a good argument on which
to hinge its plea for renewing the reciprocal
trade treaty act, which expires
next June. Assistant Secretary
George Messersmith indicated
the administration considered its
treaties a basis for lasting peace
when Europe's war is finished. Next
day Secretary Hull himself jumped
into the fight, indicating he wouldn’t
be content to postpone the renewal
until after 1940's election, even
though the 22 agreements already
made could be continued without a
congressional vote. Though farm
and industrial leaders have claimed
the program has damaged their interests,
Secretary Hull asked reporters
to compare it with the Republican
Smoot-Hawley tariffs. Two
years after these took effect in 1930,
he maintained 10 to 12 million Americans
had lost their jobs; by contrast,
he said, the reciprocal treaties
have been calculated to boost
employment.

. .
H arry Woodring, secretary of
war, announced he was proud to
have been governor of Kansas,
and the only Kansan ever named
to a cabinet post, “ but the only
real accomplishment is for a man
who was a bachelor governor six
years ago to be expecting a fourth

WEEK
A L F LANDON
No spending, no ru n n in g ?
"spokesmen” to say their say about
taxes, made his own speech at
Warm Springs, Ga. Public reaction
to the no-new-taxes feelers had been
good, and it was especially clear
that the administration would have
trouble forcing congress to levy new
taxes and at the same time increase
the national debt limit. In such a
position, the President wisely said
little and left the problem up to
congress and the people.
His statement: That national defense
outlays for the 1940-41 fiscal
year will be increased about $500,-
000,000 (total: approximately $2,200,-
000,000) and that emergency defense
taxes might be necessary. But the
people, he said, should decide whether
to finance it by borrowing or by
new taxes. That left the problem
squarely up to congross, with the
President taking a sidelines seat.
There were other indications he
would seek no third term. At Warm
Springs he urged the good people
to start agitating for a new post
office because “ we have got only a
little over a year left.” Meanwhile
Columnist Walter Lippm ann decided
the President really didn't want
another term, but only wanted the
honor of having to turn it down.

Indo-China and British Burma. On
one side of his face Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek laughed for publication,
asserting this Ja p coup
meant little; 150 miles to the west,
in Yunnan province, runs another
supply route. But inwardly General
Chiang could be worried. First thing
the Japs did at Nanning was establish
an air base from which to harass
Kunming, capital of Yunnan.

LABOR:
F ilm Strike
Whether A. F. of L. movie unions
are powerful enough to shut down
20,000 U. S. film theaters is a question
no movie producer is anxious
to test. Directed by W illiam BiofY
(whom Chicago authorities sought
on a 17-year-old pandering conviction)
studio unions in Hollywood demanded
a 10 per cent wage increase
and threatened to close theaters if
it was refused. Projectionists had
promised their co-operation. Producers
refused at first, claiming
they had lost foreign markets since
the war and faced sharp production
curtailment. Unionists countered
with not too far-fetched
charges of “ exorbitant salaries”
paid to stars. As the deadline
neared, producers capitulated. Until
February 15 the unionists will
have a 10 per cent increase. Then
the question will be opened again.
RUMANIA:
Dangerou* Step?
France and Britain were certain
R u m a n ia ’s King Carol had capitulated
to Germany when he signed an
economic pact with the Reich last
spring. But a few days later Carol
w*ent home and promptly executed
a ll the Nazi plotters he could find.
When w’ar was declared he reiterated
his neutrality, only to run against
combined pressure from Germany
and Russia. The former, seeking
wheat and oil, demanded new trade
concessions. The latter looked covetously
at Bessarabia, which R um a n
ia got from Russia after the World
war. Meanwhile R um an ia tried desperately
to form a solid neutral Balkan
bloc.
Late in November King Carol
again asserted his independence,
but not without showing partiality.
Rather than capitulate to G e rm any
’s demands for more raw material,
his cabinet resigned. In a
pinch, the king turned to a strongly
pro-ally politician, George Tatarescu,
whose coalition cabinet was designed
to keep peace within R um a nia.
Nevertheless, R um ania's Balkan
neighbors viewed the step uneasily.
Not without renron, Italian
politicians feared Carol had upset
plans for a neutral bloc by casting
his lot too definitely with the allies

m arksmen, and the rifle would be
suited to our native genius. He was
soundly patriotic and moving, as he
worked in Daniel Boone and individual
initiative, but his plea went unheeded—
in fact, the senator's suggestion
seemed amusing to most
commentators.
But, at that time, there was a
young fellow popping off the conveyor
belt ducks at Coney island
with such accuracy that he
became a virtuoso of rifle fire,
and, in between war y e ar;,
made the rifle the mainstay i.f
our army firing power, just as
Senator Brookhart said it o'r;ht
to be. The G arand self-loading,
semi-automatic rille, teste I by
National Guardsmen at C am p
Sm ith, Peekskill, has for several
years been put down by m ilitary
men as the world’s most
sensational achievement in light
arm s. The arm y took it over in
1937. It is the creation of John
C. G arand , the young toolmaker
whose earlier laboratory was a
Coney island shooting gallery.
It weighs only nine pounds, and
fires 60 shots to the minute—one
shot with one trigger-pull.
Y oung G a ran d m ade several models,
embodying his basic idea, and
sent one to the navy department
at Washington. They planted him
with the bureau of standards to
continue his experiments.
Later, they sent him to the
United States armory at Springfield,
where in 1923 he brought
through the deadliest small
weapon ever made. It has been
ite a d ily improved since then,
and, according to the most a u thoritative
m ilitary judgm ent,
has more than trebled our
arm y's firing power. Automatic
in all but the trigger-pull, muitle
gas is used to power it.
Jo h n C. G a rand was born in a
French-Canadian village, 20 miles
from Montreal, and was brought to
P u tn am , Conn., by his father, when
he was seven, after the death of his
mother. He was the seventh of 14
children. He was a textile m ill m a chinist
at 18. In 1930, he m arried a
C anadian girl. They have a boy
and a girl. He is 52 years old, still

WA SHINGTON.—It may not mean
e thing, but it is mighty curious
how all the inside New Dealers have
suddenly taken P a ul V, McNutt to
their bosoms. It was only a few
months back that they were denouncing
h im as a Fascist, to put it m ild ly.
They were bitter, of course,
about what they considered his reactionary
attitude toward labor
when he was governor of Indiana.
Why such a m a n should be singled
out by the “ Chief” and made high
commissioner of the Philippines,
they simply could not understand.
At about this tim e McNutt was a
guest—during a visit to Washington
from the Philippines—at a stag d in ner
at which President Roosevelt
was also a guest. A little skit was
put on, with McNutt the target. The
President was urged, in advance,
to pull a certain line when the character
depicting McNutt should conclude
his bombast. The original suggestion
came from a m an very close
to the New Deal. The committee arranging
the skits for this dinner
thought it would be a wow. Not
only that, but they were sure the
President would take malicious
pleasure in taking a part in the entertainm
ent which would be hum iliating
to McNutt.
Much to their susprise, the President
merely smiled at the suggestion,
and the skit had to be played
without including the Chief Executive
as one of its actors.
Bear in m ind that this dates back
to when McNutt was still in the
Philippines, though very much a
candidate for the presidency. New
Dealers all over town were interested
in the story, but they all agreed
that it would be beneath the President’s
dignity to take part in such a
slapstick comedy.
Refused to Take Part in
Skit That Belittled McNutt
The point is that anyone who has
seen Roosevelt, either in Albany or
Washington, at parties of this sort
knows perfectly well that he thoroughly
enjoys that particular sort of
slapstick.
He openly enjoys taking part in
the original skit, if there is some
point to his doing so. And he finds
plenty of things to kid his lieutenants
about without seeking outside
help.
But he refused to take part in a
skit which would have belittled the
Hoosier who was so obviously gunning
for Roosevelt’s job!
It took the New Dealers a long
tim e to get on to this policy of the
President towards McNutt. Even
after he was brought into the present
administration setup there was
considerable wailing from the left
wingers. Some of them privately
opined that perhaps the “ Chief” was
purposely assigning McNutt a task
which would be so big that he would
rattle around in it—rattle so obviously
that he would destroy himself
in the eyes of the country as a contender
for a still bigger job.
Of course there is nothing to prove
that this last theory is impossible.
So far McNutt is not rattling. He
m ay never rattle. The jdb may
make h im instead of killing him off.
But perhaps that is what Roosevelt
has been intending ever since long
before he declined to help make a
laughing stock of the Hoosier at
this dinner party.
Whatever m ay be the truth the
New Dealers seem to have concluded
that McNutt is the fair-haired
boy. Certainly the oil sprayers and
grease guns have gone to work. It
is just a little like the about-face
some of our Communist friends in
this country executed after the H itler-
Stalin pact.
Destroyers Are Helpless
Against Pocket Battleship
Few laymen understand the difficulties
which confront the British
and French navies in running down
the Nazi pocket battleships. Nearly
everyone now knows that there are
only about three ships in the whole
British navy—the battle cruisers—
which are capable both of overhauling
the pocket battleships and then
sinking them. Incidentally the United
States navy has neither the pocket
battleship nor the battle cruiser—
has none under construction—
and unless developments should
shake the present determination of
the adm irals our navy has no intention
of ever building them.
But what the layman does not appreciate
is the difficulty of hunting
down a pocket battleship with n um bers
rather than with power. In
arguments about the situation, for
example some laym an will demand
to know why a squadron of destroyers
does not go after each of the
pocket battleships reported to be
preying on our commerce, and
hound it to death like a pack of
wolves m ight destroy a bear.
Two or three of the wolves might
be killed, the laym an will say, but
the pack would kill the bear. Or.
translating the simile, two or five of
the destroyers, if the pursuing craft
are destroyers, m ight be sunk, but
the squadron would get the pocket
battleship.
It is by no means as simple as
that. Naval experts say that the ;
only function destroyers could play i
in such a chase would be as scouts, i
The only thing they could do would j
be to locate the pocket battleship,
and keep contact with her, so to
speak, until a battle cruiser could
come up for the kill.
Present-Day Gunfire
I t Amazingly Accurate
What the laym an does not appreciate
in his theory about e whole
squadron of destroyers attacking a
pocket battleship is the am azing accuracy
of present-day gunfire even
at tremendous ranges.
Of course the destroyers have
slightly greater speed than the pocket
battleships, and therefore could
determine the range at which the
action would be fought. But unless
they could come up fairly close under
cover of fog without being detected
they would all be sent to the
bottom before they got close enough
to fire a shot or dispatch a torpedo
with any hope of its finding its
mark.
For accuracy a submarine or torpedo
boat must be very m uch closer
to its target than a big-gun ship. For
example, the face of a chief gunnery
officer of a battleship would be very
red indeed if he did not hit a target
as big as a destroyer on the third
salvo—at a distance of 20,000 yards
and with the battleship from w'hich
he was firing proceeding at full
speed in a rolling sea!
Besides, the pocket battleships
carry airplanes, which are not only
useful for'scouting the surrounding
ocean, but can be used with am azing
precision, by triangulation, for
aim ing the heavy guns of the ship
when the target is over the horizon.
It would be suicide to send a
whole fleet of smaller craft against
a pocket battleship except on the
long chance that, in fog or mist, they
m ight get ctose enough to loose a
school of torpedoes.
Proposal to Transfer
(J. S. Ships to Irish Flag
One of the most am azing international
moves in all history, so far
as its inception is concerned, whether
it ever works out or not, is the
proposal to transfer ships now flying
the United States flag to Ireland
instead of P anam a.
Actually, it amounted to a straight
tip from the President of the United
States to the Irish republic and to
international shipping men that while
the United States government would
no longer countenance any transfer
of United States ships to the flag of
P a n am a , or any other American republic,
the same objections would
not lie against their transfer to the
Irish flag!
Had the scheme been thought out
in advance, and the tip then discreetly
conveyed, it would be merely
a clever device. It was the way
the idea developed that makes it
stand out.
Actually President Roosevelt was
answering questions of newspaper
men about the transfer of United
States flag ships to P anam a. He had
added one argument which had not
been printed before—that to do this
would be to encourage one of the
American republics to take a position
on neutrality divergent from
that taken by the United States.
With this subject disposed of, the
President was then asked about thc
complaints of the Irish Free State
made through its minister in Washington,
against the Irish ports being
held to be in danger zones, and
hence forbidden to ships flying the
American flag.
The President expressed his sympathy
with Ireland, Belgium, Holland,
D enmark (nam ing these individually)
and others, but said that
unfortunately the question of whether
a particular part of the sea is a
danger zone is a question of fact,
not sympathy or desire.
Suggests That Irish Buy
Some Ships of Their Own
F inally, the President himself suggested
that the Irish should have
some ships of their own! To the
immediate question of whether the
United States would be interested in
a bid of the Irish for the ships that
cannot now be transferred to the flag
of P anam a, the President indicated
that the government might be very
willing to sell. To the further question
of whether the same objection
would apply to the transfer to the
Irish flag of ships flying the United
States flag which had applied to
their transfer to the P anam a flag,
the President answered emphatically
in the negative.
That's how the idea was bom , the
President stating that he had heard
no suggestion of it, but would welcome
a proposal!
Most newspaper men at the conference
were so intensely interested
in the bigger story that the transfer
of additional ships to P anam a was
definitely off—this being the first
time that this was really settled—
and in the collateral and also tremendous
story that Secretary Cordell
Hull had again won a spectacular
victory (he has never lost a bat*
tie since he became head of the
department of state) that very little
attention was paid to this rem arkable
Irish story.
But politicians and diplomats alike
are speculating since they have been
told about it. The thing looks foolproof.
For instance, would the Nazis
dare to sink an Irish ship? If they
did. what would be the reaction*
(a) of the Irish government and pea
pie. and (b) of the Irish-American.9
m the United States?

*'I don’t get your point. What do
you reckon to find o ut?” asked Stoddart.
“ T ime,” said Moses. “ Gulbaz
times it like a jockey. He’s the
best judge o’ pace in all India. He
times it to the minute. If he
isn’t ready, then he’ll play for
tim e .”
The truck halted in front of a
house whose red front door was
bolted, barred, and scrawled in
chalk with infamous remarks anent
the virtue of its inmates. There was
an alley, a yard wide, pitch dark at
the farther end. Into that alley yellow
light streamed through a door
that was partly ajar. There was a
faint staccato drumbeat, a twang
of stringed music, the sickly wail of
a flute, and a stench in which sensuous
perfume fought with the reek of
garbage. Moses spoke to the truck
driver, and the truck driver sounded
the horn—three times, then three
more, then once.
The dissolute and dirty looking
person in the big white turban, to
whom Moses gave a captured knife
in the bazaar, appeared suddenly,
apparently from nowhere.
“ What’s that bloke up to? Where
did he come from ?” Stoddart demanded.
“ If you’d looked under the truck
you’d know,” said Moses. “ He ain’t
respectable, so he don’t ride first
class like me and you.”
Moses whispered to the man, who
walked down the alley and entered
the door.
“ Is this your harem? Aren’t we
going in ?” asked Stoddart.
“ No. You’d break the ladies’
hearts. We’ll wait here and give
’em a chance. This is Gulbaz’ temporary
field headquarters. I ’ve sent
him a message. He’ll come or he
won’t. If he don’t, we’ll know the
answer.”
“ What did you tell that bloke to
say to h im ? ”
“ I said that Sergeant Stoddart's
here with information that he’ll sell
for a price and wants a personal interview,
face to face, no gobetweens.”
“ You’ve got your nerve,” said
Stoddart. “ It’ll be all over the
bloody bazaar that I ’m telling secrets.
Why don’t you use your own
n am e ?”
“ We’ve hooked him. Here he
comes,” said Moses. “ Keep your
hair on now and sit tight. Say nothing,
and leave it to me.”
Through the door, down the alley
and straight to the truck, without
glancing aside, without a moment’s
hesitation, came a man of medium
height and middle weight, who
walked like a young god, though he
was middle-aged. He was dressed
in a tight-fitting turban, white singlet
and loin-cloth and a striped silk
semi-European jacket. He came to
the tail of the truck, gave one glance
at Stoddart and stared straight at
Moses. His smile changed, outwardly
only a little, but something happened
at the corners of his lips. It
had changed to a fighting smile,
merciless, malicious.
“ You’re a dog,” he remarked in
plain English.
“ Fancy you giving away secrets,”
Moses answered. “ I ’m here to sell
’em for cash on the nose. Me and
this Sergeant know something. I t ’s
hot. We’re splitting fifty-fifty. How
m u c h ?”
“ I will listen. You may tell your
secret.”
“ Cash on the nose,” said Moses.
“ Money down or nothing doing.”
G ulbaz’ smile changed again. It
conveyed a suggestion of vanity beyond
the utmost reach of ordinary
mortals. He glanced at Stoddart
then back at Moses.
“ Are you satisfied?” he asked.
“ You have recognized me? You can
truly report that you have seen me
in Kadur? You saw the door I came
from? Very well, you may watch me
return. After that, you may go to
the devil.”
“ I ’m staying here until my messenger
comes out into the street
alive,” said Moses.
“ I will send him to you,” Gulbaz
answered. “ He is lucky. Luckier
than you are. Wait and see.”
G ulbaz strode back down the alley
and entered the door. A moment
later the messenger came out, looking
scared, as if he felt murder behind
him. He ran and crawled in
under the truck. Moses spoke to
the driver. The truck started, forward,
because the street was too
narrow to turn around in.
“ Where now?’’ asked Stoddart.
“ Back to cam p .” said Moses.
“ Well, you drew blank that time.
If you feel as foolish as you look
you'll think twice before you call me
a fathead again. You’ve spent a
rupee eight annas for nothing, and
you’re not a cent the wiser.”
“ Plus having learned that you’re
stupider than any other blasted Britisher
I ever met,” said Moses, “ I ’ve
learned all I came for. Gulbaz isn’t
as smart as he thinks. In some
ways he’s near as stupid as you,
all along of his pride.”
“ Oh. that's easy to say but it’s
just talk ,” said Stoddart. “ If you
ask me, you’re a liar. You haven’t
learned anything. To the extent
Itoat • white m an can condescend to
a half breed without losing caste,
we’ve been fair to middling friends,
you and 1. But if you use my name
again promiscuous like that, I ’ll
knock your block off.”
“ Fathead,” said Moses. “He
knows me. He doesn’t know you.
He came out because he was curious.”
“ And he told you to go to the
devil. That’s all you learned.”
“ Fathead! You mean that’s all
you learned. I learned that he’s
ready. He’s red-hot ready.”
“ Heady for what?”
“ To get Norwood. He’s trigger*
ready. If he weren’t, he’d be playing
for time, and we’d be arguing
this minute about the price o’ what
we’ll tell him if he’ll pay.”
“ You mean he’d have bribed us?”
“ I do not. Gulbaz makes promises.
And he sometimes keeps his
promises, unless.”
“ Unless w h at?”
“ Unless someone else can keep
’em for him with a long knife. He
can hire that done for five rupees
a head. So why pay us a thousand?
Can your intellect answer that conundrum?
Figure it out on a board
when you get home.”
C H A PT ER X V I
The Maharanee was scrupulously
fair. Rather than disguise her motive,
she revealed it. She stripped
objections to it naked. She didn’t
pretend that Rundhia was a prince
of virtue or a man of his word,
except when it suited him, or when
compelled to keep a promise. The
The Maharanee believed every
word she said.
Maharanee believed every word she
said. But she used arguments that
sounded curious, even to Lynn, who
was under the spell of the eastern
environment.
Lynn later found Rundhia standing
in moonlight, in a golden turban
and European dinner clothes.
As a palace door closed behind
Lynn, she, too, stepped into the
moonlight, with her face half veiled
under the sequined sari. It was she
who looked oriental, dressed according
to the Maharanee’s wishes. Rundhia
looked like a western athlete,
in more or less fancy dress. And
he called Lynn a goddess in western
terms that any polo-playing
American gallant might have used:
“ You look like Miss India! You
almost give me religion! Pull away
that curtain! Show your golden hair,
and let’s give all the other goddesses
a sight to make them green with
e nvy !”
Lynn uncovered her head and
walked beside him in silence.
“ I feel like a god tonight,” said
Rundhia.
“ Have you been drinking?” Lynn
asked.
“ You golden-haired iconoclast!
Your arrow aimed into the heart of
my ballooning self-esteem! You delicious
archer! I have had five cocktails.
Do I seem drunk?”
“ What sized cocktails?”
“ Measured to my mood, exactly.”
“ Then you seem astonishingly sft»
ber. What have you done about
Captain Norwood?”
“ Lynn, let’s forget Norwood. I
want to talk to you.”
“ I ca n ’t forget him. You and 1
have wronged him.**
“ Has he answered your letter?”
Rundhia retorted.
“ No. But have you forgotten your
promise?”
“ D idn’t the Maharanee tell you?
Don’t trouble yourself about Norwood.
Forget him. Talk to m e.”
“ I wish to talk about Captain Norwood.”
“ He has talked about you, I don’t
mind telling you. According to one
of the palace servants, he told your
aunt this afternoon that he's disgusted
with you.”
“ I can believe hc is disgusted.”
Lynn answered. "B u t I can’t im ag ine
him saying so to Aunty, or to
anyone else "
“ Let us talk about you,” said R u ndhia.
“ Very well, what about m e ? ”
“ Now you have made me speechless!”
“ Have I? Then perhaps you will
listen to m e.”
“ Beloved, I will glady listen to
you, in an ecstasy of patience and
devotion, during years which shall
flow so fast that we’ll be old before
we know i t ! ”
“ Did you get that from a book?"
“ I never read books. When I talk
to you, my tongue can only stutter
miserable hints of how I feel. You
make me delirious. Be good enough
to notice that these arms resist im pulse!”
He extended his arms toward
the moon, then dropped them
to his sides. “ Oh. Lynn, I love you.”
“ Good job I don’t love you,” she
answered. “ There’d be—”
“ A new golden age in K a d u r!”
R undhia interrupted “ Lynn: philosophy,
religion, economics and the
other muck they made me listen to
at school and college left me, until
you came, dry of faith in anything
but evil—and even evil dying! You
are my first glimpse of goodness.”
“ Don’t you love the Maharanee?
Isn’t she good?”
“ Oh, yes. She is good past history.
Lynn, you are the present and
the future! One straight look into
your blue eyes, and I knew what
hope means and the higher vision.
I had never seen it, until I saw you.”
“ Sounds good,” Lynn answered.
“ What was in the cocktails?”
“ Don’t joke! Lynn, I ’m in love. I
mean every word I ’m saying to
you.”
“ 1 mean what 1 say, too,” Lynn
answered. “ I don’t love you— What
was that noise? In the distance. It
sounded like shooting.”
“ I didn’t hear it,” said Rundhia.
They had reached the steps that
led to the kiosk on the garden wall.
It was dark in the w all’s shadow.
He was justified in offering his arm
to guide her up the steps, but he
put it around her. She could feel
his vibrance. She escaped h im —ran
up the steps ahead of him , then
waited on the wall in full moonlight,
facing him, unafraid.
“ There! Did you hear that?
Wasn’t that a rifle-shot, R u nd h ia ?”
“ Might have been,” he answered.
“ Not so easy to tell.”
“ Isn’t Captain Norwood’s camp in
that direction?” Lynn asked.
“ Somewhere over there, yes. Possibly
a jackall or a stray dog scared
his sentries. Never mind Norwood.
Lynn, you say you don’t love me. 1
don’t believe you.”
“ Why not? I told you the plain
truth—Do you think sentries would
fire at a dog?”
“ His would! He’s crazy. Lynn, I
don’t believe you because you forgave
what I did in the treasure
room. And because when you hurt
me, you were sorry. Also because
you are not afraid to be alone with
me now. Lynn, you don’t know
yourself. You’re—”
“ Do you know yourself?” she retorted.
“ Don’t you think it strange
that they should be shooting at
n ig ht?”
“ No. Most soldiers live in a continual
state of false alarm . Lynn,
listen to me. Don't I excite you?”
“ You did. But I saw you, and 1
heard you laugh at Captain Norwood’s
ruin.”
“ You dislike m e ?”
“ Oh, no.”
“ You adm it I can stir your emotions?”
“ Oh, yes. I adm it that. Why tell
lies about it? You’re magnetic. I
almost fell in love with you.”
“ Lynn, you are thinking about
East and West. That hoary old superstition!
It lingers, they tell me,
in America more tenaciously than
anywhere else, though even schoolbooks
nowadays adm it that we and
you are of the same race. Do you
know how many western women
have become the wives of Indian
princes?”
“ I don’t want to know. I don’t
care.”
“ You are right, Lynn. Quite right.
Why should you care? It is love, not
what others have done, that crum bles
superstitions. Lynn, I love you.
I wouldn’t lie to you—”
“ Have you done your best for Captain
Norwood? Have you really dons
it? What have you done?”
“ Never mind. I have done it.”
“ You swear?”
“ Yes.”
“ Then I will listen. You wers
saying—? ”
Rundhia had to recover the train
of his thought. He turned away
from her a moment, paced the wall,
and came back:
“ Lynn, my love for you may sound
selfish. I always have been selfish,
until I met you. 1 have no practice
with words that a genuine lover
should use. But I am genuine. For
the first time in my life, I am unselfish.
May I tell you—will you
listen if I tell you—what my heart
tells m e ?”
“ Yes, I will listen, R u ndhia.”
“ Will you really listen?”
“ Yes, Rundhia. 1 would rather
listen to almost anything than my
own thought, at the moment.”
“ You are feeling deserted?”
“ Despised!” Lynn answered. “ If
Captain Norwood had answered my
letter—”
"Y o u are lonely! So am I lonely!
Lynn, diwaza kola hai! The door is
open! Enter. It is that short step
across the threshold that makes you
hesitate. L e a p !”
"Y o u mean into your arm s?”
“ Yes.”
“ No.”
“ Come, L y n n !”
“ No.”
“ Lynn, you make me hate m yself.
Am I so unappealing to your—”
Suddenly he changed his voice. He
sounded angry: “ Are you in love
with Norwood?”
“ I hardly know him. How could
I be? I only know that I never felt
dirty before in all my life. I don't
like it, Rundhia. And I can’t forgive
you for having crowed over
Captain Norwood’s disgrace. You
and I brought it on h iiu.”
“ Lynn, is that all that’s the m atter?
If I give you my word of honor
that I have solved the Norwood
problem, will you listen to m e ?”
“ Have you solved it?”
“ If I prove to you. before midnight.
that there is no longer any
problem about Norwood, will you
come into my a rm s? ”
“ Speak plainly, R u nd h ia.”
“ I will. Lynn, face it! Norwood
has no use for you. Has he answered
your letter? He has not! The messenger
reported that he tore up your
letter without reading it. I don’t
know why you care a damn what
happens to him. He doesn’t care
what happens to you. Your aunt
doesn’t care. She is leaving you
flat.”
Lynn interrupted- “ You say Captain
Norwood tore up my letter?
Why didn't you tell me that before?”
“ To save your feelings. However,
you know now. That’s how he feels.
That’s Norwood. Lynn, you are
merely hesitating on that damned
old superstitious crumbling platform
of ‘East is East and West is
West,’ that Kipling lied about. You
and I are above all that nonsense.
Lynn, beloved, come into my arms
now! You are lonely. So am I lonely.
See, I am waiting for you. Come
here. Lynn. Come of your own will.
Be mine Face things from the inside
looking outward. You shall be
my wife, and I swear by my love
for you, that Norwood—”
“ Oh, that’s only a promise,” Lynn
interrupted. “ I won’t believe you
about Captain Norwood, until you
prove it.”

Psychologist Disputes Effect of Meat on Knerpv
Is the jungle lion ferocious because
it lives on raw meat? Would
it be more gentle if a vegetarian?
And are men who* live principally
on a meat diet likely to be more
belligerent than those who prefer
vegetables?
The answers to those questions,
according to Martin F. Fritz, associate
professor of psychology at
Iowa State college, is yes and no.
Lack of meat in the diet may
cause an anim al or hum an being
to live on a lower energy plane,
F ritz found, thus giving the appearance
of a peaceful, mild disposition.
“According to that hypothesis,”
he said, "a vegetarian diet simply
depresses the activity level while
a generous intake of meat may
bring out the full energy potentialities.
“ It might be argued that the
continued eating of high protein
foods, such as meat, might result
in a permanently higher plane of
basal metabolism which would account
for the energy and vigor of
meat-eating nations,” he continued.
But Fritz apparently found a
hitch in this argument. For if
it wsrs true, he said, the Eskimos
could be expected to be especially
violent “ for they eat a meat diet
and their basic metabolism is
about 33 per cent higher than that
of people living in temperate zones.”
The Eskimos, however, are the
most peaceful and unwarlike race
in the world, the profo or declared.
Inheritance is an important
factor in the degree of activity, he
said. But, “ it may be argued
that all races have inherited a potentially
high level of activity—a
very questionable assumption—nnd
that the differences we observe are
due to the failure to utilize a diet
which will bring out this activity to
its fullest extent.”
Fritz summarized by saying:
“ It is quite possible that diet does
influence racial temperament, but
until further evidence is gathered
we may well be just a bit cautious
in drawing conclusions.”
World’s Longest Ticket?
A ticket issued by the Canadian
Pacific railway is 15 feet 11 inches
long! It was the longest ever sold
by the company, and was issued to
Miss Alice Johnston, an E n g lish lecturer,

a lecture tour.
Holiday Fruit Caket
And Cookies
H alf the thrill of Christmas is in
the pre-holiday preparations. Making
cakes that are crammed with
fruit and nuts, baking an endless
variety of cookies to be frosted and
“ trim m e d ” in true holiday fashion,
and packing gift boxes of Christmas
confections, is as much fun as the
great day itself!
F ru it cakes are s Christmas holiday
tradition. • The dark cakes *do
improve w'ith age
and should be
made as early as
p o s s ib le . T he y
won’t mold or dry
o u t i f t h e y ’ r e
properly s to re d .
Wrap the cooled
cakes well in wax
paper, then store
in tightly covered
cans. If you like, brandy or wine
may be spooned over the cakes at*
two-week intervals during storage.
White fruit cakes make a pretty contrast
with the dark, but they dry
out rather soon and should be eaten
within a few weeks after baking.
Don’t forget that fruit cakes, cookies,
and small plum puddings make
charm ing Christmas gifts, especially
for the friends and relatives
who’ll be away from home on the
holiday.

Had Mother Rode Hong—
Cheerful Nursery
Cheerful as sunshine is the atmosphere
of a nursery with walls
and woodwork painted a warm
cream color and the floor azure blue.
The farm er and his daughter
went to m arket with a load of butter
and eggs, and after selling the
produce, were returning home
with the horse and cart and the
money when they wore set upon by
bandits. The fa rm e r wept as the
thieves rode off with his horse and
cart.
“ Don’t cry,” consoled the
dauijhter, “ they didn't get our
money, anyway. 1 put it in my
m o uth."
“ What a clever girl you are,”
said the farm e r. “ Just like your
mother. I wish she’d have been
here; we m igh t have saved the
horse and cart, too.”

State Capital Letter
(Run-over from first page.)
Utility Tax Shares
Wisconsin’s local pfovemmental units
are expected to receive about seven
million dollars this week from the
state as their share of utility taxes.
This represents 85 per cent of such
taxes paid to the state.
Charles McKeown, Governor He
financial secretary, asked Secretary of
State Fred R. Zimmerman in a letter
to pay the local units their share of
the tax promptly. Said the letter
“the governor has expressed himself
as keenly interested in helping: any
locality within the power of the state,
and requests me to advise you that he
is very desirous that all towns, cities,
and villages receive their apportionment,
representing 85 per cent of the
utility taxes, upon full payment being
received by the state.
The letter was written because C. A.
Nickerson, auditor in Zimmerman’s
office, had informed the governor’s
office that the city of Ashland was in
an impaired financial condition, and
that utilties there were willing to pay
their taxes immediately if reasonable
assurance was given that Ashland
would receive its full share of taxes.
Capitol Notes
Since the cigarette tax was enacted,
it has brought in a total of $909,652.47
to the state, reports the beverage tax
division.
During 1938 the industrial commission
paid more than $426,000 in indemnity
and medical aid benefits in 725
eye injury cases under the workmen’s
compensation act. About 90 per cent
of this amount was paid for permanent
disability eye injury cases.
Wisconsin’s recent fall encampment
of national guard troops was “an unprecedented
success,” reported Adjutant
General Ralph Immell. He
praised school officials and employers
for releasing men for the week sessions.
Average attendance was 96.9
per cent for officers and 90.7 per cent
for enlisted men.
Cheering Christmas news to Wisconsin
Works Progress Administration
workers is the announcement that
those who would normally be paid
after Christmas will receive their pay
checks before the holidays.
About 60 per cent of the soil samples
submitted by more than 50,000 farm ers
to be analyzed sh >wed farms in
need of lime, reports the soil analysis
project of the W’orks Progress Administration.
About 80 per cent of the
soils lack sufficient available phosphorous
and 40 per cent do not have
enough potassium. Each farmer submitting
a sample was advised what
quantities of lime, phosphorous or
potassium was needed on his land.
A total of 53 persons have filed application
for the position of secretary
of the public service commission, reports
the bureau of personnel. Among
them are Assemblymen Ben B. Slater,
Republican; and Edward Grassman.

Dirty mouth
No swill-grubbing beast has a dirtier
mouth than man. Such is the humiliating
opinion offered in last week's
Journal of the American Dental Association
by the University of Pennsylvania’s
Dentist Ix*onard Rosenthal and
colleagues. They based their opinion
on extensive researches, mostly at
Philadelphia’s zoo. They examined
the saliva of one hippopotamus, two
lions, one baboon, two elephants, one
rhinoceros, 28 pigs, two horses, two
chimpanzees, 50 dogs, eight cats, a rat.
The saliva of all these animals, said
the dentists, “was notable for low bacterial
count in comparison with
man’s.’’ Only animal with a mouth bad
enough to be nearly human: “a 30-
year-old baboon with an extremely
dirty mouth from which many teeth
were missing.”

“ You’ve got to use strong methods.

A columnist on the Manchester
Guardian asked old George Bernard
Shaw if he had sent Hitler a congratulatory
telegram on his escape from
the Burgerbrau bombing. Shaw said
he had not, but that Chamberlain
should have wired Hitler: “Greatly as
the British nation regrets your escape,
decency obliges the British Government
to congratulate you on it.”—
Time.

The platform of the railroad station
of Lublin, in German Poland, teemed.
On it stood a forlorn, broken spirited
crowd who moved only when shoved.
The people were utterly destitute. All
they had for baggage was here a
knapsack, there a handbag, sometimes
just a cloth bundle. A few carried
scraps of food for which they had no
stomach. The most any had in cash
was 300 marks ($120). Train after
train pulled in, and passengers poured
out like ashes from dump-trucks. The
heavy crowd became unmanageable.
Finally the stationmaster blustered
out, ordered that not one more passenger
should alight. More trains came
in. He ordered them not to stop, to
clear out. “ But where to, with this
cargo?” asked the engineers.
Lublin, Poland, the city which once
complained because the Tsars changed
a nobleman’s castle into a prison, was
recently chosen by Adolf Hitler as the
site of his long-planned Jew-sump.
By next April 1, according to a German
government decree, 150,000 Jews
must be evacuated to Lublin or other
“ reservations” like it from Bohemia,
65,000 from Vienna, 30,000 from Posen
and the onetime Polish Corridor, 175,-
000 from the Lodz district, 240,000
from Germany proper.
The lot of the first arrivals was last
week reported by the Berlin correspondent
of the Copenhagen Politiken.
The unhappy Jews were virtual slaves,
The area around the city was entirely
hedged in by barbed wire and bayonets.
Gradually the Jews were herded
from the station, given quarters of
sorts, put immediately to work (twelve
hours a day) on roads, fields, bogs,
buildings.—Time, November 27, 1939.

Mrs. Flora Big Thunder, of Dancy,
formerly of Wausau, yesterday afternoon
was granted a divorce from
Robert Big Thunder by County Judge
Frank P. Regner on grounds of cruel
and inhuman treatment.
Among other charges of cruelty,
Mrs. Big Thunder charged her husband
sat in the rear seat of an automobile
with another woman while she sat in
the front seat and that he threatened
to beat her up if she looked around.
She had her maiden name of White
WTing restored, but was granted no
alimony, because she had asked for
none. Asked why she had not sought
alimony, she replied that Big Thunder
i had asked her not to.

WHEN SHOULD A
BUSINESS m en often talk about
the problem of when they should
advertise most. Should it be when
business is good and sales come
easily or when business is slow and
sales are hard?
Those who believe in advertising
most intensively when everybody
has money, argue logically enough
that It is wise, as Shakespeare h im self
pointed out several
centuries ago,
"to take the tide
when it serves.” A dvertising
then will
prove of most value,
some men believe.
Those, on the other
hand, who believe
• business should
spend money for telling
its story most
aggressively when
times are slow, say
that advertising is a
business-building force and that it
is, therefore, needed most when
business needs building.
Whenever we have a temporary
lu ll in business we sec the spectacle
of many advertisers “ drawing
in their horns” and refusing to spend
money for advertising until times
are easy once more.
The late P. D. Armour, great
packing magnate, had the sanest
view on the subject.
He always told his associates:
“ Advertise when times are good, because
then your dollars show greatest
returns. Advertise when times

Mr. and Mrs. Albert Haufe and Mr.
and Mrs. Fred Mehlberg, Jr., of Marion,

Sunday by entertaining friends

Mrs. William Wegner and family, Mr.
and Mrs. Albert. Wegner and family,
Mr. and Mrs. Fred Mehlberg, Sr., and
family, all of Marion: Mr. and Mrs.
Dave Braatz and family and Mr. and
Mrs. Jake Krasin and family, of
Marshfield.
A large number of friends from
Wittenberg, Tigerton and Marion helped
Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Schmidt celebrate
their fifth wedding anniversary
at their home in this village Saturday
evening. Present were also Mrs. Carl
Mundstock, of Rlair. Wisconsin. Mis.
Schmidt’s mother, and Mr. and Mrs.
Adolph Lehman and three children, of
Fort Peek, Montana. Mrs. I^'hman is
a sister of Mrs. Schmidt. Cards were
played and the prize winners in sheephead

The celebrating couple received many
anniversary gifts.
M A N ADVERTISE?
i r e poor, because if you don’t advertise
then your public won't know
what you have to sell.”
The public responds immediately
to the man with courage enough to
invest his money in advertising even
when the condition of the market is
not so good as he would like to see
it. The public responds always to
courage.
In 1921, when America had a short
business depression, A. W. E rickson,
now dead, made the directors of
a company in which he was interested,
agree to spend $150,000 a
month for advertising during the
next 12 months.
Business fell off. The director*
wanted to renege. Mr. Erickson
wouldn’t let them. He made them
spend their monthly advertising allowance.
He had faith.
When prosperity returned, as it
always does, that company, because
of courageous leadership, skyrocketed
to the top, a position it still
holds.
What had happened was that its
public, you consumers, read those
advertisements and subconsciously
became friendly to a business which
would continue to tell you its story,
in bad times as well as in good. The
public reciprocated by giving it its
trade.
Whenever a business man advertises
it shows he has faith in h im self,
in his community, in his goods
and in his customers.
He is a good business man with
whom to trade.

Baver Aspirin is world-famous.

“Frenzy and the Beast”
SO M E of the most horrible stories the world has ever read
were written by a fellow nam ed E dgar A llan Poe way back
i in the beginning of the last century. Historians and biographers
j tell us that Poe was a m an with a wildly disordered m in d—a
feverish, almost insane brain, out of which he concocted his
i strange and terrible tales. The yarns he wrote were pure fiction,
the vaporings of his brilliant but m ad imagination. While
: reading one of his strange stories you might almost be tempted
j to say that nothing so bizarre could ever happen in real life.
But don’t say it. You m ight be wrong. Truth has a trick of
turning out to be stranger than even the wildest sort of im a gin a tive
fiction.
One of the most famous o f Poe’s stories is called “ The
Murders in the Rue Morgue.” It is the tale of a ghastly m u rder—
the tale of a woman throttled to death and her body
stuffed up a fireplace chimney by a huge ape. And there is a
curious, true parallel to that m acabre flight of fancy in this yarn we
have here today, told by Distinguished Adventurer Anna Jacob of Woodtide,
N. Y.
. I t happened on Ju ly 21, 1918, and it's the story of the most
terrifying experience in Anna Ja co b ’s life. The yarn involves a
couple of neighbors in Passaic, N. J . , where Anna then lived, so
let's look these neighbors over. One of them lived a few blocks
away from Anna’s home— a Mrs. Gutches who had three sm all
children aged two, four and six. On the fateful Ju ly day when
A nna’s number turned up in Adventure's lottery. Mrs. Gutches had
asked her to stay at her house and take care of the children while
she went out to do some shopping.
Anna Consents to Watch Neighbor’s Children.
Anna consented—and so we find her, as our story opens, in a
second floor bedroom of the Gutches home, watching over little two-year-

Business Man
His father had given the little boy
a dollar for his birthday. A ll afternoon
the boy trotted around the
neighborhood getting the bill changed
to silver at the grocers, back to a
bill at the bakers, and so on. His
father asked him the reason for his
behavior.
“ Veil,” said Ikey, “ sooner or later
somebody is going to m ake a mistake
and it a in ’t going to be m e.”
Too Many Gadgets
“ I c a n t understand why the
housework wears you down,” complained
the bridegroom. “ This house

bride. “ I guess I ’m just fagged out

Reason Enough
An old man at the theater had
dropped something, and the woman
next him asked what he'd lost.
“ A c a ram e l!” said the old m an
much to the wom an’s surprise.
“ You mean to say you’re looking
for a single c a ram e l? " she asked.
“ Ay,” was the reply. “ You see,
my teeth's in it.”
Snappv Comeback
“ How old are you, sonn y?" asked
the inquisitive old m a n of the little

“ Six,” came the reply.
“ Six,” echoed the old m an, ‘ ‘and

“ How old is your um b re lla ?”
asked the boy.

More Confusable That Way
The girl entered the bus with a
pair of skates under her arm .
A m an immediately got up and offered
her his seat.
“ Thank you very m u ch ,” came
the reply, “ but I've been skating all
the afternoon.
She seized the fork prongs and made a ja b at the ape.
old Anna May who lies asleep in her crib. In another room the other
two children are taking their afternoon nap. It ’s two p. m ., and a ll’s
well. But it won’t be in another couple of minutes.
Down the street a few doors from Anna Jacob's home is another
neighbor, and there is where the trouble is brewing. This
other neighbor has a pet ape four feet tall, stocky and powerful,
in a cage in the back yard. The ape is tam e—but in his big,
hairy paw he holds a bottle. The bottle is half full of whisky and
it has been given him by the gardener, who thinks it's a great
Joke to see the an im a l get drunk. But watch out. Mister G a rdener.
Men have done terrible things under the influence of liquor.
What will an ape do in the same condition?
The ape finishes the bottle of whisky. His teeth show as his lips
cu rl back in a snarl. One great, m uscular arm grasps a bar of the
cage— bends it—rips it out. The ape crawls through the opening. He's
olf. over the fence— free—drunk—looking for trouble as he hops and
reels along through the back yards along the block.
No one saw the ape break loose from his cage. No one saw him
prowling through the neighborhood. The first one to see him at all was
Anna Jacob. In the second floor bedroom where little Anna May slept
in her crib, Anna heard some strange scratching sounds. She went to
the window and stood frozen with terror at the sight of the ape climbing
up the side of the house.
There Was a Fiendish Look in the Ape’s Eyes.
Anna didn't know the ape was d runk, but there was a fiendish
look in his bloodshot eyes, and a meaning in his curled lips and
bared fangs that told her something was wrong. That ape, never
too tractable in the flrst place, was now a snarling bestial demon.
On it came, straight toward the window out of which she was
looking. It swung up to the sill, reached out with strong, hairy
hands, and R A IS E D THE SASH!
As the window went up, Anna leaped back. Her eyes darted about
the room, but the only weapon in sight was an apple picker—a set of
forked prongs on a five foot wooden handle. She seized that and made
a ja b at the ape.
The ape was half-way through the window, nut hc drew hack.
Without knowing it, Anna was using the one weapon that anim als
are afraid of—the same sort of sharp, pointed goad that lion
tamers use to keep their huge cats at a distance. The ape made
another lunge through the window, but again Anna thrust forward
with her pronged stick.
Again the ape drew back. Anna could keep h im from coming through
the window—but that was all. If she relaxed her vigilance for a moment,
the drunken beast would be in the room. She wanted to run for help,
but that would mean leaving little Anna Mae, in the crib, to the mercy
of the brute. And there was no mercy in that glowering sim ian face
and those burning, bloodshot eyes.
Anna Watches Chance to Catch H im Unawares.
“ As I kept thrusting the apple picker at h im .” Anna says. “ I
watched my chance to catch him unawares, but the ape was too
quick for me. I prayed that he would get tired of dodging that
picker and go away, but he only g larrd at me out of his ugly
little eyes and kept on trying. Hours passed, and I was almost
ready to drop from weariness and strain. Again and again I
thought of running for help, hut if I left that ape alone for a moment
he would kill the child in the crib— perhaps even break
down the doors and get at the other children.”
It was late that afternoon before any help came to Anna. Then the
owner of the ape came home, found h im missing and searched the neighborhood.
Not until then wos Anna released from duty that kept her
standing before that window making repeated jab s with her stick at that
drink-crazed brute. She was all but exhausted by then, but at last the
children were safe.
Anna says she never wants to see another ape as long as she lives,
and I don't blame her. My guess is that if it hadn't been for her courage
and fortitude. Poe's story of the Murders in the Rue Morgue m igh t have
been repeated in Passaic.

Cracking and sealing are two of
the methods by which paint weathers.
Some of the causes of this,
painters say. are the use of paints
containing an excess of hard nonelastic
pigments, heavy coats of
paint not properly rubbed out,
paints mixed with an excess of fatty
linseed oil, or cheap paints containing
an excess of unsuitable pigments
and oils, which form a brittle instead
of an elastic film. Other reasons
advanced bv oaint authorities
are painting over a peeling, cracking,
or scaling old coat without removing
the old paint; prim ing with
such pigments as iron oxide. Venetian
red, ochre, or Dutch p in k ; longdeferred
repainting, especially when
a brittle or semibrittle paint was
used previously, and painting over
wood having an excess of resin in
it. All paint experts advise against
spacing the paintings over too long
periods.
