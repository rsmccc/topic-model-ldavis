            IT’S an ill censor that blows
            no picture some good. Warner Brothers’ “Yes, My Darling Daughter" is the latest
            picture to profit by censorship.
            And anyone who saw the play
            of the same name on which
            the picture was based is likely
            to suspect that the movie
            moguls who were responsible for the film rather hoped that a little
            censorship, though a dangerous
            thing, might result in plenty of free
            publicity.
            New York’s state censor board
            obligingly banned the picture.
            Whereupon the department of education's board of regents even more
            obligingly lifted the ban, and the
            public rushed to the theater where
            the picture was finally shown, eager
            to see what all the fuss was about.
            In fact, so much interest was
            stirred up in this darling daughter
            that the theatrical producer who
            produced the original play is said
            to be considering reviving it.
            Some of Hie women who read the
            books of the “Five Little Peppers’ a
            series when they were children trill
            be escorting their grandchildren to
            tee those young Peppers on the
            screen. The series of nine books
            has been bought for Edith Fellows.
            
            Isa Miranda was so upset when
            she lost the title role in "Zaza” to
            Claudette Colbert that she was
            ready to give up and go home to
            Italy. But when the picture was
            released she had reason to thank
            her lucky stars that the cast didn't
            include her name.
            Now Paramount is making it up
            to her by giving her a grand chance
            in the re-make of “Hotel Imperial,”
            and has also booked her for
            “Tempted,” which should prove to
            be something extra-special. And la
            belle Miranda thinks America is a
            swell place and is taking steps to
            become an American citizen.
            When Baron Cal von Ripper spent
            seven months In a concentration
            camp he probably didn’t believe
            that it would ever do him any good.
            Now that experience stands him in
            good stead. RKO Pathe has en-
            gaged him to act in an advisory
            capacity for their forthcoming feature length picture, “Unknown Patriot.”
            
            Rose Bampton may not have
            Grace Moore’s genius for publicity,
            but her name is practically a house-
            hold word all over the country,
            thanks to her radio performances.
            The first of the Metropolitan Opera
            company's glamour girls to be initiated into "The Circle,” she was
            called back for a repeat performance. Three days later she had to
            be back on the East coast for the
            
            Hobby Lobby show.
            And of course she Is always bob-
            bing up on Bing Crosby’s program
            —she has appeared on it nine times
            so far.
            George Murphy, master of ceremonies of the “Screen Guild Show,”
            thinks he works pretty hard. He
            has to track down movie stars and
            arrange for their appearances on
            the program. So far his "work" has
            involved skeet hunting with Robert
            Montgomery, swimming with Loretta Young in her private pool, skiing
            with Basil Rathbone and visiting
            Judy Garland during school hours.
            
            After broadcasting for two years
            and thirteen weeks for one sponsor.
            Al Jolson departs from the air in
            mid-March, possibly to remain a
            non-broadcaster until fall. He is
            slated for a Twentieth Century-Fox
            picture, “Rote of Washington
            Square," and wants time to work
            on a new type of radio program.
            HIs place Is being taken by Dick
            Powell. The rest of the cast re-
            mains the same.</p>
