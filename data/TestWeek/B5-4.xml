         <p>TEXACO OILS BEAT MIL-
            WAUKEE ALL-STARS 60 TO 50
            i In their first game of basket ball
            > under the sponsorship of Bruce Van
            - Gorden’s Texaco Oil Company Mer-
            i rillan’s caging gentry went on a scor-
            ing rampage against the Milwaukee
            | College All-Stars to win a sparkling,
            | rapid-fire victory before a crowd that
            , was left gasping at the terrific speed
            of the Milwaukee men and the deadly
            , efficiency and brilliant play of the
            , New Texacos. Two of the visitors,
            . Beland pivot man and a little guy
            . named Corwin, were out and out
            , good. Another geezer entitled John-
            ' son might have been good too but the
            ! gent was too dam busy trying to keep
            • up with Christy. He might just as
            well have forgotten about Christy—
            . we still have to see a ball player who
            , can come close to following the lad.
            It’s worth real dough to see Christy
            when the going is tough and fast—
            ■ the guy could win in a race with a
            load of buckshot out of a melon patch
            and Sunday with a team of college
            stars as opposition the big Norsk was
            a streak of light—we don’t mean to
            slight Frost, Matalas, Nichols, Hayden
            or Porter, they contributed plenty,
            but we like the beautiful and that’s
            what Christy’s work was. Ketchum
            of Milwaukee later said “Nobody
            could stop that fellow—he’s the fast-
            est big man I’ve ever seen.”
            For Milwaukee the man who looked
            best was Belond, a well proportioned
            fiant, who handled the leather like
            ohn D. used to handle dimes, i. e.
            with the greatest of facility. His
            passes were smooth and clever like
            Ellison’s, but unlike Ellison’s they
            didn’t bound off a teammates nose.
            An all-star was set to receive it when
            he let loose and as the 50 points by
            the enemy testifies they also caught
            the Texacos off balance with this pass-
            ing business.
            But to the game; during the early
            portion thereof the city slickers were
            completely baffled by the Texaco’s
            fast break, as well as the zone type
            of guarding. Thrice the Milwaukee
            boys called time to regain composure
            as Merrillan drew further and further
            away, but nux vomique (whatever
            that means) our heroies lead by the
            rangy Frost and “The Cyclone” Mat-
            alas, scampered off to a 19 to 7 first
            period advantage.
            In Act 2 H. Porter, valet of bo-
            vines in private life, gave the folks a
            show of plain and fancy caging by
            bracketing eight tallies in the space
            of four minutes to act as the fire-
            works in bringing the oil men up to a
            32 to 18 edge for the half.
            At rest time the big town collegi-
            ans evidently had brewed up a plot
            involving dark deeds against Mr. Van
            Gorden’s oil business for when the
            whistle signaled the return to action
            the bombarding by the enemy started
            and the scorekeeps pencil done a Gil-
            da Grey marking down the counts.
            Twenty tallies went thru for the Reds
            bringing their total to 38. The Tex-
            acos in the meantime had pushed
            their total up 12 to make it 44 to 38.
            Came the curtain quarter and more
            fireworks—with the enemy rapidly
            coming up, Clifford “Lightnin’ Chris-
            tianson went to work and teamed with
            Pickles Nichols to bring Merrillan out
            of danger, they took turns with field-
            ers by Hayden and Matalas made the
            Merrillan Texacos count an even 60.
            Beland Corwin and Werner added a
            dozen for Milwaukee to bring their
            score to 50—so the barrage ended 60
            to 50.
            Having thus sunk one great oppon-
            ent the Texacos are now preparing
            themselves for another, on March 23
            the famous Globe Trotters will try
            out their wares against the fast tra-
            veling Merrillanites. This will be the
            biggest basket ball treat of the year,
            and the finale to the Texaco’s sea-
            son at home. The biggest crowd in
            years will be on hand to see the col-
            ored stare. We hope to see what a
            black man looks like when he blushes.</p>
