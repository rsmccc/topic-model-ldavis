         <p>ATTEND THE CLASS PICNIC
            Four classes of the Black River
            Falls High school pledged themselves
            to leave as a lasting memorial the
            beautiful curtain and other stage fixtures that have been of so much use 1
            for the many events that have been 
            held in the high school auditorium 
            since it was completed. Two of the 
            classes have made their payment and
            gone on their way. The class this
            year will make another and then the
            class of 1940 will complete the gift.
            The one big event of the year from ,
            which a class hopes to realize an ap- 
            preciable amount as their gift is their
            class play. The members of the cast
            go to a great deal of work to make
            it a successful event. 
            Spring Fever
            is the play this year. It will be giv-
            en Friday evening, March 24th. Tick-
            ets are now being sold. It is an un- 
            usually good play and promises a nice 
            evening?s entertainment. You may
            do your bit toward encouraging the 
            class and toward making your con-
            tribution to their gift by attending
            the play. Plan to reserve Friday night
            of next week for that purpose.</p>
