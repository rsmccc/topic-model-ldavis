            Reason
            The school inspector was visiting
            a class and. as was his habit, gave
            a little talk on general subjects n
            an and favor to interest the chiidren
            in the everyday things of life. Or
            the occasion, says London Tit-Bit!
            
            Mccawber, he was talking about the
            blacksmith and his trade
            “And who kind of arm muscles
            has the blacksmith?" he asked
            "Big ones'” shouted the children
            "And why is the blacksmith's arm
            bigger than mine, for instance?
            "He works!" came the reply in
            chorus
            
            A Touchy Animal
            A hard up sportsman bought a
            hunter and put off payments for a
            time. Later he met the man who
            had sold him the horse.
            "I am not satisfied with that animal he said
            "Why, what's the trouble?” asked
            the dealer.
            ‘‘Well, it won t hold its head up
            said the sportsman.
            "Oh, that's all right, sir; it's his
            wnde. Just you wait till he’s paid
            for”—“Pearson’s Weekly.
            
            Charity
            "Say, George, are you one of the
            directors of the Charity ball?”
            "Yes”
            “Weil, it would be a charity to
            give me a ticket, and lend me a 
            dress suit.”

            Young Oscar was busily working 
            on the examination for office boy when he came to this question:	.
            "How far is the earth from the
            sun?"
            Oscar thought, and finally wrote, 
            "I can't recall exactly, but I don’t 
            believe the sun is close enough to.
            interfere with my duties as office 
            boy
            P. S. He got the Job
            
            Pretty Tough	
            The tourist had stopped to change 
            tires. "I suppose," he remarked to 
            a native onlooker, "that in these 
            isolated parts the necessities of life
            come pretty high."
            "Y’er right, stranger replied 
            the native, gloomily, "an’ it ain’t
            worth drinkin’ when ye get it I

            Unfortunate Plight
            "When I grow up, will I have a 
            husband like daddy. Mother?”
            “Yes, Betty."
            "And if 1 don’t get married, will 
            I be an old maid like Aunt Susan?"
            "Yes, child."	
            Deep thought for a minute.	
            "Well, I sure am in a fix."

            them in cars and shipped 'em to

            want to «et out of here!
            Nurse—Lie down and be quiet
            The doctor is a very excitable man
            and loses hts patience easily.
            Patient—So I heard and that's
            why I want to get away!
            
            How Absurd
            “What's that building?” asked
            the stranger
            "That’s the asylum for the blind,"
            said the native
            “Go on, you can’t fool me,” said

            dows for?"

            No Pleasing Her
            “Have you arranged your holidays yet?"
            "Not absolutely. My husband
            wants me to go with him for a trip
            around the world, but I want to go
            somewhere else.”

            with you I suppose all your life
