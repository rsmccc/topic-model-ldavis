            A correction should be made in *
            one of last week’s items. It was the E
            Ladies Aid that had the second birth- A
            day party at the church instead of S
            the Study club. There is no use C
            talking there are too many societies
            in the village. It’s hard to keep track
            of them all and their activities.
            Keep this date in mind—Friday
            evening, March 31st. It’s the day
            that the children’s program, sponsor- p
            ed by the Ladies Aid, will give a fine C!
            program. It will be an all-children jc
            program, which includes “Pandora p
            Opens the Box’’. Mrs. Fahlgren is c]
            directing.	
            A birthday party was held at the n
            Oscar Skaar home last Saturday eve-
            ning, and many attended. It was in
            celebration of Oscar’s birthday, and hi
            Wm. Haas’. Five Hundred was play- n
            ed and a fine lunch served.
            RECEPTION WELL ATTENDED
            , Perhaps 100 people, altho a count
            was not had, attended the reception
            , given by the Commercial Club at the
            . school house Saturday evening for
            Dr. Boxer, the new resident physician
            , and his wife. A feeling of good will,
            ’ fellowship and cooperation prevailed
            thruout the meeting, and every one
            present was well pleased with the
            ■ whole affair.
            The meeting was opened by George
            | Purcell, master of ceremonies, who
            after a few opening remarks, intro-
            duced various numbers of the pro-
            gram. The high school band gave
            three fine selections to open the pro-
            gram. C. A. Nolop was called upon
            and gave a short talk on the history
            of the club and how the plan for a
            ' new doctor started, and the trouble
            they had at first, but finally success
            was accomplished. Prof. S. J. Olson
            then gave a talk on what connection
            the school had with a doctor, giving
            good sound reasons. Mr. Davidson
            then gave a violin solo. Rev. Fahl-
            gren then gave a talk after which
            Mrs. Pierce was called and gave a
            reading, "The Oyster Man”. Oscar
            Rickard gave a short talk. R. H.
            Hamilton gave “Casey at the Bat”.
            Mrs. Jennie Van Sickle in behalf of
            the mothers of the village, gave a
            welcome in their behalf. George
            Bouchard gave a “real speech”, so he
            said. Edward Persson was next with
            a few remarks asking the question
            “What should be the most desired
            thing in life”, and answering by stat-
            ing “Health”.
            Dr. Boxer was then called upon
            and he acknowledged the hearty wel-
            come he had received and was very
            appreciative of it all. After the pro-
            gram Dr. and Mrs. Boxer were intro-
            duced to all individually. A light
            lunch was then served.</p>
