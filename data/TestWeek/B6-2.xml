            M. E. CHURCH GAINS IN
            SUNDAY SCHOOL
            A gain of eight in average attend-
            ance at the Sunday Church School of
            the Black River Falls Methodist Epis-
            copal church has been achieved in re-
            cent months. The Rev. H. A. Allison
            is pastor and Mrs. A. H. Trask is
            acting superintendent.
            The local church is participating in
            the Church School Advance which has
            brought gains in attendance in Meth-
            odist Sunday schools all over the na-
            tion, according to word received by
            the pastor from the Board of Educa-
            tion of his denomination in Chicago.
            The northern branch of Methodism
            has achieved a gain in average Sun-
            day school attendance of 25,411 in
            less than a year. In the southern
            branch of the communion the gains
            are approximately 100,000.
            The Church School Advance pro-
            ceeds by three very simple principles
            â€”Hold the pupils you now have,
            gain new pupils by a better under-
            standing of the community and its
            needs, and improve the school by the
            training of lay leaders.</p>
