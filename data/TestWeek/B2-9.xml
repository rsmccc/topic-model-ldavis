            The Chaimson Maytags took undis-
            puted possession of first place by
            winning all three from B. A. E. while
            the Moe Clothing Co. won a pair from
            Tollack Coals for second place, one
            game behind the leaders. The Ha-
            gen Clothiers took sole right to third
            place in winning two from Coca Co-
            la. The Clothiers are two games out
            of first place. The Millis Contract-
            ors and S. C. S. are tied for 4th,
            three games behind the Maytags and
            Jones Creams and Tollack Coals still
            retain a chance to win out, being 4
            games from the lead. The Maytags
            lead looms larger by the fact that
            there remain only six games on the
            schedule.
            The results last week:	Tuesday
            night Larkins won two from Camp
            Irving, and Jackson Box won a pair
            from Jones Creams. Wednesday eve-
            ning Hagens took a pair from Coca
            Cola and Soil Conservation followed
            up with a pair from Millis Contract-
            ors, winning the final by a margin
            of only one pin. Thursday as stated
            before, Chaimsons won all three from
            B. A. E. and Moes took a pair from
            the Coals.
