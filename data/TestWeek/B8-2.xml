         <p>TAYLOR HIGH-SCHOOL
            Jeanette Stevens
            Last week a new ceiling was plac-
            ed in the main assembly, storage
            room and typing room. The pupils
            were seated in the halls and different
            class rooms. The typists were also
            placed in the halls.
            There has been a great number of
            absentees this week. We will be glad
            to see them return to school soon.
            All of the freshman girls in the
            Home Economics class are anxious to
            start making their dresses so Miss
            Rendall came to the conclusion that
            they would start next week.
            Last week the sophomore Home Ec.
            class had an experiment. They were
            shown how and also helped to dress a
            chicken. The chicken was donated by
            Verna Jacobson.
            This week the American history
            class prepared a map showing how
            the United States grew. Shown on
            the map were the original 13 states;
            Louisiana Purchase, Texas Annexa-
            tion; Spanish Cession of 1819; Gads-
            den Purchase; First Mexican Ces-
            sion; and the territory in Washing-
            ton, Oregon and Idaho secured by dis-
            covery, exploration, and settlement.
            This work pointed out to the history
            students how our country was enlarg-
            ed through the growth of territory.
            English—
            The sophomores have finished the
            study of verbals. Next week they
            will take up “As You Like It” after a
            quiz and participles, gerunds and in-
            finitives.
            The freshmen are busily working
            learning differentiation of pronouns
            in the accusative and nominative
            case.
            The Juniors and Senior American
            Literature class finished their essay
            contract Friday. Every one in the
            class did sufficient supplementary
            work to warrant him an A or 6
            grade.
            The local declamation and oration
            contest will be held March 24. The
            league contest in which Hixton, Mel-
            rose, Alma Center and Taylor will |
            participate is to be held on March 31.
            Taylor will act as host this year.

            Independence captured first place
            at the tournament by winning from
            Alma Center, Taylor and Blair re-
            spectively.
            Blair took second place by beating
            Trempealeau and Whitehall but lost
            the final to Independence.
            Third place went to Taylor who
            defeated Arkansaw and Whitehall
            while being the victim of the Inde-
            pendence team.
            Consolation went to Alma Center
            who beat Arkansaw and Hixton while
            losing to Independence.
            Chet Johnson of Alma Center scor-
            ed the most points at the tournament:
            he had 28 points in three games.
            Duane Lambert of Taylor, scored
            the most points in a single game by
            registering 13 points against Arkan-
            saw.
            Clayton Waller played his last
            game of basket ball against high
            school competition when he left the
            floor after Taylor-Whitehall game.
            His record for the past years are as
            follows: Freshman 4 pts.; Sopho-
            more 19 pts.; Junior 44 pts.; and
            Senior 131 pts. He scored a total j
            of 198 pts. during his high school |
            career. He played guard the first !
            three years and took up playing for- |
            ward in his last year and did a nice j
            job you must admit Taylor’s bas-
            ket ball team will miss him and the |
            person who takes his place will find .
            that position hard to fill as Clayton
            filled it.
            The Independence team will be hit |
            hard next year by graduation, for
            six players will be graduated.</p>
