         <p>JACKSON COUNTY TO HAVE
            COUNTY NURSE
            The State Board of Health is pro-
            viding a county nursing service for
            Jackson county for a period of at
            least one year beginning April 1st.
            Miss lone M. Rowley, R. N., from
            the bureau of public health nursing
            in Madison, was in town last Thurs-
            day, making arrangements for the
            service.
            A committee, composed of Emil
            Gilbertson, chairman of the county
            board, one other member of the
            board, Harry M. Berry, county judge,
            and Miss Grace Webb, county super-
            intendent, one doctor, one dentist
            from the county and one member
            from a woman?s club, will be formed,
            to work with the nurse locally. The
            county will be at no expense for the
            nurse for a period of one year, with
            the exception of an office, which is
            being provided by the county in the
            former law library in the court
            house.
            The nurse expense is financed
            through the United States Children?s
            Bureau funds because half of the
            nurse?s time is to be devoted to giv-
            ing sendees to expectant mothers and
            young infants and the remainder of
            her time in giving a generalized pub-
            lic health nursing service for the
            county. She will begin her work in
            the county April 1st.
            LARKIN HARDWARE SPON-
            SORING SPORTS SHOW
            There will be a sporting show last-
            ing two afternoons and evenings at
            the high school gym, which will be
            sponsored by Larkin?s Hardware.
            March 25th and 26th are the big
            days. The gym will be open from 1
            p. m. until late in the evening, and
            there will be a program of events
            from 2 to 4 in the afternoon and
            about 8 to 10 in the evening.
            Norman Larkin has been attending
            events of this nature for the past six
            years in Minneapolis, and hoped for
            one here all that time. It has taken
            him about the last three years to get
            arrangements made for his talent and
            displays._ Now they are all set and
            there will be many sportsmen from
            this region and even at a distance
            who will be interested. They will
            know the standing of the following.
            Jack Reihl will demonstrate fly and
            bait casting.
            Bob Tainter, nationally known
            sports writer and fisherman, will be
            here. He ties flies for the tops fish-
            erman and will bring his work with
            him.
            Bill and Frances Johnson will do
            expert and fancy trick shooting.
            TOMAH MEMBERS
            VISIT ROTARY
            There was a delegation of members
            from the Tomah Rotary in attend-
            aance at the regular meeting of the
            club here Monday night, at the Free-
            man hotel.
            The annual meeting of the Upper
            Mississippi Valley Safety Conference
            is to be held in May in Tomah, and
            the visiting delegation Monday night
            presented a summary of the program
            plans to put on for the safety meet-
            ing. It was held last year in Chip-
            pewa Falls, with between five and six
            hundred attending the banquet. A
            big meeting is planned for Tomah,
            and there will undoubtedly be many
            from here in attendance.
            COCA COLAS PLAY TWO GAMES
            The new city team, the Coca Colas,
            played Taylor on the home floor last
            Thursday night, winning with a score
            of 42 to 34. We call attention to a
            more detailed writeup in the Taylor
            news this week. We very much like
            their use of the phrase tasting the
            bitter weed of defeat.‚Äù
            If it is any consolation to Taylor
            the Cokes had a taste of that weed in
            the game at Merrillan last night.
            Merrillan defeated them with a score
            of 42 to 15, in spite of the fact that
            the Cokes led 9 to 8 at the end of
            the first half.
            Tomorrow night (Thursday) the
            Coca Colas play Fairchild in the high
            school gym here.

            An item in last week?s issue of the
            B-J referred to the return from Cali-
            fornia of Mrs. Rose Clarin, daughter
            Miss Anna Elsie, and nephew. The
            nephew was Harold Kelner, of Buf-
            falo Springs, N. D. He will spend a
            few weeks among relatives here be-
            fore continuing his journey home. His
            father, Charles Kelner, had also spent
            the winter in San Diego with his fam-
            ily and left for home the same time
            they did. He too, made the trip by
            car.
            Miss Nadine Kirkpatrick, daughter
            of Mr. and Mrs. H. C. Kirkpatrick,
            of Blair, was married February 24th,
            1939, at Decorah, Iowa, to Paul R.
            Johnson, of Hixton. For a number of
            years the bride was engaged with her
            father in the publication of the Blair
            Press.
