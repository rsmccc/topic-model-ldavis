         <p>Phil Long Gets Prison Term
            Millard F. Long, better known in
            Tigerton as Phil Long, who had been
            living here with his family for years
            at the expense of the village, was sentenced Tuesday by County Judge A.
            M. Schelier of Waupaca county to the
            state penitentiary for a term of 12 to
            IS months on an abandonment charge.
            He had been haled into court last
            week at Clintonville when that city
            get tired, of Long's insistence that he
            was entitled to relief, hls refusal to
            work, and his characteristic refractory
            tactics. He claimed he bad seven different disease which made It impossible for him to work. A doctor said
            he had had them at one time, but
            there was apparently nothing wrong
            with him now. He had deserted his
            family for several months and this
            charge was pressed against him and
            resulted in his conviction.â€”Tigerton
