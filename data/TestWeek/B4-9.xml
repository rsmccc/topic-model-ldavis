            IN MEMORIAM
            In sad but loving memory of our darling
            little boy, Harold Allan Duerkop, who was
            so suddenly taken from us one year ago
            today, March 14, 1988, at the tender age
            of three years, lu month? and 14 days.
            We had a little treasure once.
            He was our pride and joy;
            We loved him, oh, perhaps too much.
            He was our darling little boy.
            All is dark within us.
            Lonely and sad are our hearts today;
            For the one we loved too dearly
            Has forever passed away.
            Sadly missed by hfs parents and brother,
            MRS LYLE DUERKOP
