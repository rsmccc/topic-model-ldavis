         <p>RICHARD GARY YESKE
            Richard Gary, youngest son of Mr.
            and Mrs. Harold Yeske, passed away
            at the age of ten months and four
            days, of Intuscption. He was born
            May 5, 1938. He was taken serious-
            ly ill on Tuesday, and rushed to St.
            Francis hospital, La Crosse, where
            everything possible was done for him.
            The oxygen tank was used, but his
            little body could not ward off his
            death.
            He is survived by his parents and
            one brother, Harold Junior, aged 4.
            Also his grandparents, several aunts,
            uncles and cousins.
            A short service was held at the
            Morris and Hellwig funeral chapel at
            La Crosse at 1 o’clock, and at 2 o’-
            clock at the Methodist church in Mel-
            rose. Rev. Beal officiated. Interment
            was made in the Melrose cemetery.
            Pall bearers were four small boys,
            namely Robert Yeske, uncle of the
            deceased; Billy Myers, Elmer Hayes,
            both cousins of the deceased; and a
            neighbor boy, son of Mrs. Irene Ben-
            dle. The little girl cousins were the
            flower girls.
