            Mrs. Will Colby received a message
            from John Brinkman of Waycross,
            Georgia, that his wife died Feb. 24.
            She was formerly Miss Florence
            Head, one of the fine teachers of
            Jackson county years ago. A num-
            ber of years ago the Brinkmans went
            south to live. For the past three
            years she suffered of dropsy and the
            past year was confined to her bed
            most of the time. The funeral was
            held Tuesday, and she was laid to
            rest in the nearby cemetery. Her
            sister, Mrs. Ed Hostrawser (Mary-
            Head) is also resting there. Mrs.
            Brinkman visited here several years
            ago and always kept in touch with
            former friends by reading the B-J.
            She leaves an adopted son and her
            husband, who have the deepest sym-
            pathy of old friends in Jackson coun-
            ty.
