            ed to Black River Falls, settling in
            the Town of Komensky.
            She was married February 17th,
            1909 to Joseph Hryz, at Black River
            Falls. He survives and deeply mourns

            1 and family and hbld in highest esteem
            ; by a wide circle of friends. She
            earned an outstanding reputation for
            ' cooking and homemaking and was al-
