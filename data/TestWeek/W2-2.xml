            foot high fire tower on Sugar Bush
            hill near Crandon, is the means

            the Heil administration to replenish

            cigaretes is being fought by Wisconsin tobacco growers, who have had
            spokesmen at legislative committee
            hearings to voice their opposition. 
            The measure known as the Sauld bill 
            would levy a tax of 2 cents a package on both cigaretes and cigaret
            papers. Proponents estimate that

            and Michael M. Wittenberg, an attorney, have been found guilty by
            Circuit Judge Schinz, Milwaukee, of
            attempting to extort $2,000 from Dr.
            Leland L. Trump, a Milwaukee physician. The convicted men face prison sentences of on# to two years or
            fines of $100 to $500 each. It was
            held that they attempted to “shake
            down” the physician under threat of
            obtaining revocation of his license to
            practice medicine after he had
            agreed to perform illegal operations
            on two of Drews' women investigators.
            
            Labor Law Revision Nearer —In
            the face of bitter opposition by organized labor representatives, the
            bill before the legislature to repeal
            the present state labor law and prohibit sit-down and minority strikes
            and secondary picketing moved a
            step closer to enactment in the assembly when that body voted engrossment, 84 to 44, The next assembly vote will be on final pas-
            sage and If the measure wins it will
            then go to the senate. Assembly-
            man Biemiller, Milwaukee socialist,
            called the bill a “straight-jacket on
            labor" and delivered a warning that
            if it became law union labor sup-
            porters might not vote for "farmer
            exemptions" when tax bills are up
            for passage. Besides prohibiting sit-
            down and minority strikes and secondary picketing, the measure places
            a ban upon the closed shop without
            approval of 75 per cent of the employee, forbids deduction of union
            dues from an employe's pay check,
            requires unions to submit financial
            reports to members and denies the
            right to strike in eases involving the
            producers of perishable farm products unless 10 days notice has been given to the employment board.</p>
