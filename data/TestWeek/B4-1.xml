         <p>LADIES BOWLING CLUB
            Feb. 20th
            Black River Cafe brightened the
            alleys Monday nite, by marching in
            with their new yellow blouses, with
            black lettering, and black skirts. They
            were so taken up with their attractive
            outfits that Millis Service Station
            stole two games from them. Beatrice
            is having hard luck, we must admit,
            by having two on her team drop out
            at this late date and having to start
            two new bowlers, namely Emma Han-
            son and Mildred Glennie. We all
            know that the handicap doesn’t add
            up fast enough to care for this, so we
            all wish each one of Bea’s team all
            the good luck and breaks that can be
            had, in bowling, for the rest of the
            season. Lesters took two from I.
            G. A.

            Lesters—		
            Monday night, Feb. 27th, a pretty
            soft shade of blue Dlouse, with an
            I. G. A. emblem, decked the bleach-
            ers of the bowling alleys. They too
            made a very colorful and neat appear
            ance. In spite of the fact that they
            looked so nice, they had bad luck;
            they clamped down to take the first
            game from Millis Service station, but
            lost the 2nd and 3rd game each by 2
            pins, making them both hard games
            to lose. Here’s hoping you get a bet-
            ter break the next time you bowl us.
            Lesters took all three from B. R.
            Cafe.
            Beatrice Zahrte rolled 166,	158
            and 146 for 470 for high triple and
            also second high series for the lady
            bowlers for this year. Alva Larson,
            subbing for the evening, had the high
            game of 181.
