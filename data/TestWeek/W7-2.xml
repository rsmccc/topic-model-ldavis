         <p>Origin of Morgan Horse Has Been Traced to Other Breeds
            The founder of the house of Morgan in the horse world was a horse
            born about 1789—the property of
            Justin Morgan, who kept a tavern
            in Springfield, Mass., until he
            moved to Randolph, Vt., in the
            same year that was foaled the colt
            which was to perpetuate its owner’s
            name No one seems to have any
            knowledge of the blood strains of
            this famous sire, writes Capt. Maxwell M Corpening in the Chicago
            Tribune. Some historian* of Morgan horses say he was anything
            from a thoroughbred to a Canadian
            pony Others claim many infusions of Arab. Barb, and Turkish
            blood Bo that as it may, a good
            horse was produced
            This founder of the clan was
            named Figure at birth, but renamed
            Justin Morgan when its offspring
            started to gain fame. He was a
            small horse, only 14 hands high
            and weighing 950 pounds; dark bay ,
            In color, with black legs, mane, and
            tail. The latter were coarse and 
            heavy but not thick. His head was
            good but not very small—the forehead broad, with small ears set far 
            apart His eyes were medium size,
            dark, and prominent, with a pleas-
            ant but spirited expression. His
            back and legs were his most noticeable points—the former being 
            extremely short, with shoulder
            blades and hip bones long and
            sloping. The legs were short, close-
            jointed, and thin, but with very .
            wide bone and extremely well muscled for a horse of his sue.</p>
