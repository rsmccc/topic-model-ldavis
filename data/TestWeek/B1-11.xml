            Two boys, 17 and 18 years old,
            and a girl, 16, all from Milwaukee,
            were arrested here about 5:30 p. m.
            March 4th. The sheriff?s department
            picked them up at the Wadham sta-
            tion after a call from the Zink oil
            station just over the line in Clark
            county to the effect that they got
            away with about $2.00 of gas there.'
            Sheriff Waldum found the car belong-
            ed to Raymond Ridiske of Milwaukee,
            and had been stolen the day before.
            He hel dit here. Deputy Olson came
            from Neillsville and took the three
            young people back. They were re-
            turned to Milwaukee last Tuesday
            night and the car also was reclaim-
            ed that day from here. The girl had
            a gun with her, which she had taken
            from home. They had driven to the
            state line at Hudson but did not have
            money to pay toll charges at the
            bridge, and turned back. Probably
            their next plan would have been to
            use the gun in a hold-up and then
            what? Crime didn?t pay in their case.
            Their career was short.
            Mrs. Anna Ristuben recently cele-
            brated her 80th birthday anniversary
            at the home of her son Oliver and
            family, where she makes her home.
            There was a coffee party in her hon-
            or at which the members of her fam-
            ily in this section were in attendance.
            Mrs. Ristuben is remarkably active
            for her years, and walks along like
            somebody about half her age. In
            spite of the fact that she was laid up
            for a few days recently, she was able
            to walk down town and around Sat-
            urday, and walked to church to at-
            tend services Sunday. We wish her
            many happy returns of her anniver-
            sary.
            Anton Ellingson of Northfield, and
            his brother-in-law, W. W. Thompson,
            of Rochester, Minn., were visitors in
            town Friday. Mr. Thompson has been
            visiting for the past month in Wi-
            nona, Osseo, and at Northfield at
            the home of Mr. and Mrs. Ellingson.
            planned to return home Monday of
            this week.</p>
