         <p>The Humbird Enterprise carried an
            obituary of Mrs. Florence Brinkman,
            of Waycross, Georgia, last week, with
            this addition:	‚Mrs.	Brinkman	will
            be lovingly remembered by many old
            friends here. Their home was here
            at the time of their marriage, and
            we believe she was one of the early
            teachers in our schools. Prior to
            moving to Georgia they lived in Alma
            Center where Mr. Brinkman was sta-
            tion agent.‚</p>
