         <p>BLACK RIVER VS NE1LLSVILLE
            Black River was defeated, in what
            was by far most exciting and thrill
            ing game of the season, by Neillsville
            in an overtime 28-26. It was a hard
            battle from the opening tip-off, with
            both teams fighting for all they were
            worth, never once did either team
            let up.
            The two high point men on the
            Black River five were Horswill, who
            tallied 11 points, and Olson who made
            10. The scoring was pretty much di
            vided on the Neillsville team but Bre-
            mer with 8 to his credit and Whitte
            with 6, led the scoring. Neillsville
            was at an advantage due to the
            height of their team. But neverthe-
            less Horswill and Upton did some nice
            work in regard to getting the re-
            bounds and capcured the ball for
            Black River many times.
            The first quarter was fast and fu-
            rious with both teams holding the
            other down. It ended in a tie 6-6
            In the second period Black River
            broke loose and seemed to gain the
            upper hand. At the half the score
            read 14-9 in favor of Black River.
            Neillsville came back the third quar-
            ter to score or bust. It again was
            a hard, fast quarter and Neillsville
            managed to lessen Black River’s lead
            for at the end of the quarter it was
            19-16 in Black River’s favor. During
            the fourth, a spurge of scoring start-
            ed. First one team and then the
            other. Neillsville at last tied up the
            score 23-23. The time was getting
            short and the crowd was wild. (Olson
            then made a push shot and seeming!
            clinched the game but Neillsville too!
            the ball and Bremer broke loose for a
            set up. It was then 15 seconds to go.
            The fourth quarter ended in a
            queer situation with a foul called
            with V. Olson the shooter just as the
            whistle blew. He missed however,
            and thus a 3-minute overtime was ne-
            cessary.
            During the hard battle of the over-
            time Neillsville managed to get a bas-
            ket and a free throw and held Black
            River down to a free throw. It was
            a hard game to lose as Black River
            had held the lead until almost the
            finish and a quick basket by Neills-
            ville lost the game for them.
            All in all this last home game was
            a good one between two evenly
            matched teams in which both were
            out to win.</p>
