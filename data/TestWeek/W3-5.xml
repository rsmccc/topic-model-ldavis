         <p>Adventurous Americans by Elmo Scott Watson
            "Pegleg" Smith
            For an example of chilled steel 
            nerve, consider the case of Thomas L. Smith. He and his partner,
            Jim Cockrell, were trapping in the 
            Green river country of Wyoming in
            the  820s when Smith fell over a 
            cliff and broke his leg. It was not  
            an ordinary fracture. The bone 
            was shattered and a piece of it protruded through the flesh. Prompt
            action was necessary to prevent
            blood poisoning.
            “Guess we’ll have to cut ’er off.
            Jim," said Tom Smith, calmly.
            Their only instruments were a
            three cornered tile and their hunting
            knives. Cockrell used the file to
            make a saw of Smith s knife. Then
            Smith took his partner’s knife, cut
            through the flesh, tied up the ar
            teries. sawed the bone, seared it
            with a redhot iron and sewed up
            the stump.
            When the wounded leg healed.
            Smith made a wooden leg for himself
            and thereafter he was known as
            "Pegleg” Smith. Before the accident he had been a famous horse
            man. Now there was all the more
            reason for going mounted and the
            wooden leg apparently made little
            difference in his horsemanship.
            At any rate be became the most
            successful horse thief on a large
            scale to the history of the West. He
            spent most of his time organizing
            expeditions into California to rob the
            Spaniards. He and the famous Jim
            Beckwourth made one foray into the
            land of the dons that netted them
            3.000 head of horses!
            But when California came under
            the Stars and Stripes it changed the
            habits of "Pegleg"  won’t never
            steal from my fellow Americans he
            declared virtuously. Temperance,
            however, was not among hts newly
            acquired virtues. He ended his
            days, a victim of strong drink, in
            San Francisco in  866.
            
            A Perilous Journey
            CAPT. RANDOLPH B. MARCY
            halted with hts party of 40 sol
            diers and 25 mountain men at the
            junction of the Uncompahgre and
            Gunnison rivers on his way to Fort
            Union. N. M , in  857. “Me no guide
            you over San Juan mountains in
            winter time," declared the old Ute
            Indian chief.
            Capt Marcy had orders to join the
            forces of Col. Albert Sidney John
            ston near Sait Lake City with ani
            mals and supplies, The orders said
            to proceed without delay so there
            was nothing for Captain Marcy to
            do except proceed in spite of the
            Indian warning that none of the
            men would get through Cochetopa
            pass alive, the party left December
            for Fort Massachusetts near the
            present Fort Garland
            Four days later, when they
            reached the mountains, winter s
            fiercest storms were raging. Snow j
            twirled and beat against their facet. {
            It piled in deep drift* and hung
            heavily on the legs of animal* and
            men. The cold became totenae.
            Captain Marcy* detachment
            pushed on, although animals fell  
            dead in their track* and men had to j
            abandon equipment. Before they j
            readied even the summit of the |
            pass their rations were exhausted ;
            and they had to eat the flesh of the
            mules as the animals died.
            On January  2 couriers from a
            relief party arrived and announced
            that help was close at hand. Short
            ly thereafter aid came So starved
            were the men that Captain Marcy
            issued strict warnings to eat spar
            ingly.
            Hts orders evidently were only
            partly .obeyed as one man died from
            overeating—the only fatality to one
            of the most trying adventures of
            American history.
            
            The Scholar Builder
            IN  798 Gabriel Richard, a French
          priest, arrived in Detroit, whose
            muddy streets were lined with log
            huta and shacks housing its  .200
            inhabitants, But most shocking of
            ail to Pere Richard, who had been
            a teacher to France, was the utter
            lack of educational opportunities for
            the children of the village.
            With what fund* be had, he found
            ed private schools and began a campaign to establish public schools.
            Music whs lacking, so he gave the
            people their first organ, brought
            piece by piece on pack horses al
            most  ,600 miles through the wilder
            ness, He succeeded in getting Detroit its first public library.
            He mode a journey lo Washington
            to get federal funds for other projects and brought a printing press
            with him when he returned. With
            it he established the first newspaper
            in Michigan.
            In the election of  823, Pere Richard was chosen delegate to congress
            from the Michigan territory which
            included all of Wisconsin and Iowa,
            pari of Minnesota and a small
            strip of Ohio.
            When the Asiatic cholera swept
            the city in  832, Pere Richard vis
            ited the sick and dying without
            thought of himself. He died September  2, the last victim of the 
            epidemic, and leaving behind him
            many monuments of accomplishment.</p>
