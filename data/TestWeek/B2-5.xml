         <p>MR. AND MRS. OSCAR CLARIN
            CELEBRATE SILVER WEDDING
            Friends here will be interested in
            the account of the silver wedding an-
            niversary of Mr. and Mrs. Oscar Clar-
            in, which was celebrated recently.
            Both Mr. and Mrs. Clarin were for-
            mer residents here, and although they
            have made their home in North Da-
            kota for many years, they have nu-
            merous friends here who join in
            wishing them many happy returns of
            the day. The Beach News contained
            the following account of the event.
            Monday night the Page hall in Gol-
            va was the scene of a huge gathering
            of relatives and friends of Mr. and
            Mrs. Oscar Clarin. They came to help
            this well known Golden Valley couple
            celebrate their 25th wedding anniver-
            sary, and a very enjoyable party re-
            sulted. The hi¬ªh light of the eve-
            ning was a moclc wedding which in-
            cluded an all-star cast, such as Henry
            Rising as the bride, Connie Carew as
            the groom, Prof. Dooley and Otto
            Johnson as the flower girls, Vic Ren-
            storm as the brides mother, Vera Co-
            vert as the father, and Louis Raisler
            as the minister in action.
            Dancing was indulged in by many,
            and a general social good time was
            enjoyed by all present. Late in the
            evening a fine lunch was enjoyed and
            every one present departed wishing
            Mr. and Mrs. Clarin many more hap-
            py anniversaries in years to come, a
            wish in which the News is indeed glad
            to join.</p>
