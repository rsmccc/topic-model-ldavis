         <p>MRS. MILTON YOUNG
            Effie Elizabeth Wilson, daughter
            of Danford and Mary Wilson, was
            bom in the town of North Bend, Sep-
            tember 4th, 1876. While a small
            child her parents moved to what is
            known as the Silas Amidon place,
            located near Melrose, and it is here
            that she spent the greater part of her
            younger life.
            On April 12, 1899, she was united
            in marriage to Milton M. Young, and
            the couple started house keeping on
            the Young farm, located in Red
            School House Valley. In the year
            1900 they sold their farm in Red
            School House Valley and purchased
            the Mark Douglas farm which has
            been their home ever since. Some
            years ago they built and moved to a
            new home on the farm, on the edge
            of Melrose.
            About 30 years ago she became af-
            flicted with paralysis which affected
            her legs. She was to Mayos clinic
            at Rochester, Minn., and many other
            places with hopes of getting help and
            relief from this dreaded disease.
            About 24 years ago she was compel-
            led to use a wheel chair which she
            used the remainder of her days. Even
            with this great handicap she contin-
            ued to do the greater part of her
            house work and always was cheerful,
            having hopes that some day she would
            be able to walk again.
            On October 15 last she was taken
            to Saint Marys hospital at Sparta,
            where it was found that she was suf-
            fering with other complications. She
            underwent a major operation and it
            was found that her ailment was in-
            curable. On November 19, she was
            brought back to her home, where she
            was given the best of care and medi-
            cal attention to the end. She pass-
            ed away at 6:45 p. m. Sunday, March
            5th, 1939, at the age of 62 years,
            six months and one day.
            She was a member of the local M.
            E. church and also a member of the
            Royal Neighbor lodge and took much
            Interest in both.
            She is survived by her husband,
            Milton Young; two sons, Earl and
            Lyle, both at home; one daughter,
            Mrs. Cerdetta Ameson, Eau Claire.
            One son, Clifford, passed away May
            9th, 1906, at the age of three years
            and three months. She also leaves
            three sisters:	Mrs.	Lenora	Kidney,
            Sparta; Mrs. Etta Mierow, Khedive,
            Sask., Canada; and Mrs. Inez Aus-
            tin, Leal, North Dakota. One broth-
            er, Delbert Wilson, lives at Rainy
            River, Canada; two brothers, Hubert
            and Charles Wilson were living in
            Montana when last heard from. She
            leaves two grandsons, Ronald and
            Donald Arneson. Sympathy goes to
            her family in its bereavement.</p>
