         <p>DEDICATION OF PLEASANT VIEW SCHOOL
            The Pleasant View school building,
            which was recently completed, will be
            formally dedicated Friday of this
            week.
            Everybody is welcome to attend the 
            dedication, which will be held at 4 p.
            m. Friday. The building will be open
            for inspection during the afternoon,
            and all are invited to go through it
            and see what a fine improvement and
            addition it will be to the facilities of
            School District No. 4. A special invitation is extended to the members
            of the district to look over the building.
            The improvement was made under
            a WPA grant, and the former two 
            rooms were refinished, two new 
            rooms larger than the others, added,
            and a full basement put under the
            building. There is an automatic control heating system and the building
            is modem in every way and accord-
            ing to state requirements. Play-
            ground equipment has been installed.
            Hot lunches are served in the basement.
            Classes have been held in the old
            building, in the church, and in the
            town hall for the past two years due
            to over-crowding. It was a much
            needed addition and improvement.
            State Superintendent John Calla-
            han, of Madison, will be chief speaker at the dedication. Miss Grace
            Webb, county superintendent, E. S.
            Jedney, Mr. Hughes of Sparta, engineer in charge of the job, 
            and possibly others will appear on the program. 
            Harold Turner is chairman of
            the general arrangement committee.
            The P. T. A. of Pleasant View is
            taking a prominent part in arrange-
            ments for the day, and will serve hot
            lunches during the afternoon and eve-
            ning. There will be a program both
            afternoon and evening.
            There are 144 pupils enrolled in the school, and four teachers Coyle
            Radcliffe, Miss Erika Balsiger, Mrs.
            Olga Waldum and Miss Cora Gut-
            knecht.</p>
