         <p>B1-4 Spring Fever
            The day before commencement is
            a detrimental time for spring fever. But that is just when it hits '
            Brookfield College, and sets Mrs. 
            Spangler?s (Nellie Mae Wyss) board-
            ing house in more frenzy than ever. 
            Ed Burns (John Gruber), who is 
            a chemistry student, is on the track
            of a substitute for dynamite. Vic
            Lewis (Bob Hoffman), who is an art 
            student, forces the wrong man to 
            pose as a model for a Bolshevik spy.
            Howard Brant (Allan Siemers) frantically types on a term of paper for 
            zoology. The men who will determine 
            whether or not Howard will graduate 
            are President Dixon (Bruce Rich-
            ards), Professeur Bean (Bob Amo),
            and Mr. Purcell (Wayne Glennie).
            In the meantime Mrs. Purcell j
            (Aleen Trask) searches for her husband who she is sure has been kid
            napped. Anne Purcell (Mary Rose
            Boyer) wastes no time in inventing a 
            plot to make matters better or worse. 
            In this scene Vic and Vivian (Jane
            Davis, who is Vic?s heart-interest) aid
            Anne.
            There is another important senior
            in Spring Fever Lou Herron 
            (Rosli Zwahlen) who being a jour-
            nalism student, breezes in every now
            and then to use the typewriter, and
            maybe?to see Ed.
            But why tell more? It is all fast
            and furious and funny?with loud ex-
            plosions every now and then from
            Ed?s stinkum stinktorum for good
            measure.
            Says Ed, wish college was al-
            ways like this. So does every one.
            When you?ve seen one day of Spring 
            Fever you?ll think it?s swell.
