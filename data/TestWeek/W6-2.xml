         <p>Needle Weaving for Blue Luncheon Set
            By Ruth Wyeth Spears
            
            "DEAR MRS. SPEARS: I had
            been wanting somes really
            handsome velvet roses to pep up
            an evening dress. 1 was thrilled
            to And In your Book 1, Instructions for making them from materials i already had. i would
            also like to thank you for the
            knitted rag rug in Book 1. My
            Mother spent many happy hours
            making it last winter.
            “i thought you might be Interested in a luncheon set I have just
            finished. It was planned to go
            with a set of blue dishes. There
            are four mats and a long runner
            in medium blue linen with bands
            of old fashioned needle weaving
            in darker blue across the ends.
            Just two edges of the napkins art
            banded with the weaving.”
            You who have pink dishes might
            like to try the same idea in tones
            of rose. Use a rather coarse linen. Prepare the work for the
            weaving by drawing out the fabric
            threads as for hemstitching. Etch
            step is shown here in the diagram.
            Either linen or mercerised em-
            broidery thread may be used.
