         <p>Indian Hospital News Last week we had a number of patients come in from the Oneida
            country. Among them were Scharlene Smith, Betty Smith, Helen Hill, Iola Skenandore, and
            the Winnebagos who came in were Fred Sam, George Gi_en, Lena Blackcoon, and Jess
            Oâ€™Brien. Those who went home last week were, Jack Smith, Rinton Doxtator. Elizabeth
            Hammer and infant daughter Marjorie, Irvin Blackdeer, and Jacqueline King. A baby girl
            was born to Mr. and Mrs. Herman Browneagle of Mauston on March 10. They named her Deanna
            Lee. A baby girl was born to Mr. and Mrs. George Metozin of Kaukaune, on March 12. They
            named her Georgene Joyce. Since writing about the twins a couple of weeks ago, we have
            had numerous people inquire about them. Charlie Low Cloud is improving slowly. Frank
            Starr, a Chippewa Indian, hitch-hiked his way from Chicago up here to be examined and
            treated. He left today. News is scarce this week, it must be spring. </p>
