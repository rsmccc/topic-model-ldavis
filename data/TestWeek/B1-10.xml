            ERVIN P. RIGGS
            Ervin P. Riggs, son of Mr. and
            Mrs. Harmon Miles Riggs, was born
            September 11, 1861 in the village of
            Alma Center, Wis., and passed away i
            at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Ed- |
            na McMullin, Sparta, on Monday,
            March 6, 1939 at the age of 77 years,
            5 months and 25 days.
            His parents died when he was
            about 13 years of age, after which
            he made his home for a short time
            with his aunt, Mrs. E. L. Brockway
            of Black River Falls. He received
            his education in the public schools at
            Alma Center, after which he worked
            in the woods and on the farm, know-
            ing something of the hardships and
            adventures of the pioneer life. .
            He was married to Frances E.
            Marks, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. G.
            N. Marks, of Alma Center, on March
            6, 1883. He passed to his reward
            on the anniversary of his wedding,
            after 56 years of happy married life.
            Through a period of 52 years .Mr.
            and Mrs. Riggs made their home on
            the home farm one mile north of the
            village, moving to their present home
            in Alma Center four years ago.
            For many years Mr. Riggs was a
            prominent member of the Modern
            Woodmen of America, and continued
            as honorary member of the order un-
            til the time of his death. He served j
            for some time upon the town board
            and was always interested in things |
            that were for the betterment of the
            community.
            He leaves to mourn his loss his
            wife and four children: Mark M., of
            Kinsman, Ohio; Ralph H., of Racine;
            Mrs. Edna McMullin, of Sparta; and
            Clayton W., who lives on the home
            farm. Two children preceded him:
            Catherine who died in infancy, and |
            Ernest L., who passed away August
            1929. Fifteen grandchildren, eight ,
            great-grandchildren survive.
            Mr. Riggs was one of those good
            friends and neighbourly men who are j
            missed in any community. His chief |
            and continual interest was in his
            home and his strongest bond of affec-
            tion was with those who shared :ts
            happy intimacies with him. Never-
            theless he was interested in the folks
            who knew and made many friends
            who w^ill greatly miss him.
            The funeral was held from the
            home and the Methodist church at
            Alma Center last Thursday after-
            noon. Services were conducted by
