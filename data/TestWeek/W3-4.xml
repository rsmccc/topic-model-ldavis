         <p>Who's News This Week 
            By Lemuel f Parton
            NEW YORK.—Lester P Bartow  
            temperamental inventor o  
            bombs and other war weapons, recentiy said he wasn't going to congress with his  
            bad news about
            the devastating
            German at.
            bomb, because
            they “put him in the doghouse"
            when he tried to tell the house naval
            affairs committee something last
            year. But his story gets into the
            Record, via Senator Bennett C.
            Clark, who relays to Maj. Gen. H.
            H. Arnold the news of the bomb, as
            he had it from Mr. Barlow, and
            asks the general what about it. The
            general tells of army reports that
            the German bombs in Barcelona
            “killed every human being within
            the range of a quarter of a mile."
            The USA was supposed to
            have used about
            worth of Bartow bombs and
            weapons in the World war.
            Several weeks ago, the senate
            voted himl in royalties
            for the wartime ase of his patents. He it a prolific inventor,
            now consulting engineer for the
            Glenn I. Martin Co., of Balti
            more, builders at bombing
            planes. He describes the new
            German bomb as truly horrendous, basically a combination of
            liquid oxygen and carbon, but
            with ether ingredients, such as
            magnesium and aluminum. He
            thinks he can Just about match
            it with his L. O. X. bomb.
            In  632, he offered to President
            Hoover a simple buttonpushing rig
            which would wipe out a city hundreds of miles away. Even with
            the backing of Senator Frazier of
            North Dakota, he failed to got the
            government interested and was said
            to have offered his device to Russia
            and Germany. Later, he had other
            disappointing encounters in congress, offering, among other things,
            a shockproof battleship, on whose
            ribs the heaviest  projectile would
            be just the pat of a powderpuff.
            
            BIG, Bucko Giuseppe Creatore,
            puffing smoke from a cigar as
            unfailing as Vesuvius, makes a
            grand comeback, as he nears 70. to
            his own and
            celebrated its 300th birthday with a
            big splash of 4tecent grand opera,
            with Signor Creatore finding in
            "Aida" something in the range of
            his titanic energies. The opera
            company will be permanent, financial wind and weather permitting,
            to be supplemented by a series of I
            symphonic concerts.
            As band conductor, Signor
            Creatore need to earn as much
            as  5.MS a night. He slipped
            out of sight, and then, in June,
            935, was conducting one of the
            park bands of the New York
            Emergency Relief burets. Hi*
            cigar and his bston were still
            bold and unwavering and he
            told the reporters be was paying
            the country back to bettor
            times. He bad with him about
            half of the players in his old
            band of the  of their tuneful
            and triumphant national tours.
            He arrived to this country from
            Italy in  602, with a lush black mustache and a heavy mane, but little
            else worth mentioning. Two days
            taler, he was playing on Hammer
            stein s roof. A contemporary of
            Sousa, he became one of the country s most famous bandmasters,
            only temporarily clipped —or
            eclipsed—by the depression, it is to
            be hoped.
            
            WHHEN Britain and the United
            ” States begin to exchange cook
            ing recipes, they are really getting
            neighborly. Carlota, the British
            poetess, who arived here recentiy, not
            friendly relations, prefaced her trip with a
            radio appeal for American recipes.
            She got more than 2,000. When we
            get to toiling each other about our
            operations, the entente will be com
            plete.
            Carlota is the wife of Louis
            Oppeoheimer, managing direc
            tor of the South African dia
            mond syndicate. She has pub
            lished many books of poetry In
            many countries, speaks seven
            languages fluently, and finds
            time to convert old houses Into
            charming dwellings or "mews,"
            for working people.
            Her London home is one of the
            great social and political salons of
            England. She knows the proverbial
            way to the now somewhat intransi
            gent American heart. Her visit
            marks a pleasant departure from
            the customary exchange of recipes
            for cooking TNT and the like</p>
