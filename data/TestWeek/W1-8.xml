         <p>Robbers Flee After
            Alarm Is Sounded
            Two robbers who broke into Frenchy
            Racineâ€™ tavern at Phlox early Monday
            morning escaped amid a hail of bullets
            after the Racine boys were awakened
            by a home-made burglar alarm
            The burglar* broke into a rear win-
            dow of the tavern. The home-made
            alarm is so constructed that no on#
            can enter the tavern without tripping
            The three Racines, Bob, Dave and
            Frenchy jumped out of bed as soon
            as the alarm sounded. They turned
            on the lights from the house which
            flooded the area around the tavern
            with light. The burglars hastily came
            out of the window they had broken
            into. As they came out they were
            ordered to stop by Bob hut kept on
            running.
            Bob took two shots at them with a
            .30-40 rifle and believed he struck one
            of the men as he stumbled when Bob
            shot. The men then jumped into a car
            and speeded away as Dave fired two
            shots at them with a .38 revolver.
            Sheriff Frey was called immediately
            and although the Phlox area was
            searched no trace of the men had been
            found. Antigo Journal.</p>
