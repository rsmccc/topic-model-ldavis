            The class of 75 members is one of
            the best groups to go out from the
            WBU, grade requirements being a
            “90” average. Charles Chenoweth has
            been among the many students who
            has far surpassed the requirements.
            He is a Fraternity member, because
            of his scholastic achievement and per-
            sonal development. Commencement
            exercises will begin at 3 o’clock. Ar-
            rangements have been made to ac-
            commodate several hundred people.
            One of the main events will be the
            awarding of a gold, a silver, and a
            bronze medal to the three members
            of the graduating class who have
            shown outstanding qualities as stu-
            dents, and have proven by their per-
            sonality and attitude that they are
            worthy of these awards. The next
            highest award that the WBU can give
            any student is a diploma, which sig-
            nifies that the student has satisfactor-
            ily completed the course of work laid
            out for them. Friends of the school
