            Basketball again takes the spotlight
            in the F. F. A organizatlon. Thursday right the Ag. boys will meet the
            Eland gradi tournament chimp ins.
            who will be reinforced by some of
            the is freshmen and sophomore player
            it should be an evenly matched game,
            although the local boys have a slight,
            age advantage.
            Our locals didn't make too good a
            showing against Antigo, but they hop
            to play a much better brand of ball
            this next game. If they are successful in turning back these highly publicized grade champions, plus high schoo| help, they will have a very good
            chance of winning their return game
            with Antigio.
