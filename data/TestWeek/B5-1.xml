            The local cribbage club was entertained by Oscar Rickard at his home '■
            last Thursday evening. Mrs. O. M. >
            Rickard served a fine 6:30 dinner to •
            which all did ample justice. The game 1
            called cribbage then started and how •
            the boys did ramble. At the close ‘
            the following scores were discovered: 1
            R. H. Hamilton 188, C. J. Johnson i
            176, Fred Helbling 167, Eric Erick-
            son 144, J. H. Stiehl 140, Oscar Er- t
            ickson 130, C. A. Nolop 124, O. F. i
            Peterson 101, Nels Erickson 98, Os- 1
            car Rickard 83, Harry Hendrix 47
            and Ed Persson 42. One of the up- i
            sets that should be recorded was when '
            Joe Stiehl and C. J. Johnson played 
            against Elmo Johnson and Ed Persson 
            in the first game. The two former 
            won the game by 74 points. Wow! 
            Chairman Chas. Olson of Jackson
            county, C. A. Nolop of Merrillan, and 1
            George Ringrose of Alma Center, s
            were at Winona on Monday and met
            with a part of the county board there
            and talked over matters pertaining to
            the highway from Winona to Merrillan. Especially were they interested .
            in the new high bridge across the *
            Mississippi and the bridge just west
            of Merrillan across Hall creek. As
            these two bridges represent both ends J
            of Highway 95, which has been seg-
            regated as the Trempealeau Trail, it
            is essential that these bridges be
            built. There is no question that some .
            thing will be done on this particular *
            highway this year, to start a better
            road between these two towns.
            Everett Frost has been placed in
            charge of the recreation activities r
            among the boys of the village, Eric e
            Motte being removed because of non-
            citizenship. Mr. Motte has had charge c
            of the boys for the past year, and has 5
            done some good work, but the “pow- 5
            ers-that-be” say that aliens must be
            removed, hence the change. Everett C
            is a graduate of our local high school 7
            and will continue to do good work y
            among the boys.
            L. L. Sherman has sold his service $
            station to a party from Eau Claire,
            who took possession last Saturday, i-
            Mr. Sherman built the station just a
            few years ago, and has done a fine d
            business, using Standard products. J
            Under the new owner the D-X prod-
            ucts will be used, and Mr. Sherman
            will continue to have charge, which f
            will be pleasing to his many custom- h
            ers.	g
            Ted Winson broke the index fin- _
            ger of his right hand in two places
            last week while cranking a car. The
            car didn’t kick, but something hap-
            pened and his finger got the injury. -
            One break was just above the second
               joint and the other up in the hand. |
               It will lay him up from work for
               some time.	</p>
