         <p>Pennies in the Mail Box
            (Author unknown)
            In the cold and blustery weather
            When the frost is on the rail.
            Would you like to face a blizzard
            With half a ton of mail?
            In the biting blizzard weather
            When the snow comes to your knees,
            Would you like to fish for pennies
            While your feet and fingers freeze?
            When the gloaming snow is drifted
            Underneath a foot of sleet.
            Would you like to have chillblains
            On your elbows and your feet?
            When outdoors the wind is whistling
            And the air is full of snow,
            Would you like to have a jitney,
            And the blamed thing wouldnâ€™t go?
            Yes, I'd love the good old fireside.
            Sipping coffee from a pail.
            But 1 have to buck the snow-drifts
            Cause the farmers want their mail.
            I wouldn't mind the frozen snowdrifts,
            When my knees are stiff with
            cramps.
            If you'd keep your blooming pennies,
            And buy a quarter's worth of
            stamps.
            I got snow mixed with my whiskers
            And I get it in my socks,
            But It never hurts my feelings
            Like loose pennies in the box.</p>
