            Winnebago Indian Tribe
            for Chicago University
            A distinguished and interesting
            visitor in the village last work was a
            Mr. Srolie, Ph. D., of the University
            of Chicago Dr. Srolie has been com-
            missioned by the University to write
            a book on the Winnebago Indian
            people. This winter he is studying
            the Winnebago of Wisconsin Next
            summer he hopes to visit the Winnebago in Nebraska and get in touch
            with those scattered throughout the
            United State. Dr. Srolie is both
            sympathetic and open minded in his
            attitudes; and if he is able to complete his study, his book will be very
            valuable and authoritative.
