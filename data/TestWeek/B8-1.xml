            TAYLOR A. C. 33-PINE CREEK 25
            The Taylor A. C. basket ball team
            had a heavy scheduled week last week
            and dropped two out of three games
            played. Tuesday night the boys step-
            ped out and defeated the strong Pine
            Creek team by a score of 33 to 25.
            This was the best, fastest and clean-
            est team the boys have been up
            against this year. The game started
            very fast and the speed was never
            reduced during the 40 minutes of
            playing time.
            Hess and Toxen played wonderful
            game at the guard position while
            Peterson went out after those count-
            ing buckets with 8 field goals and a
            free bucket. Hues of the Pine Creek
            team led with 8 points.
            TAYLOR 34-COCA COLAS 42
            Taylor traveled over to the county
            seat on Thursday night and there
            were deafeted by means to miserable
            to describe. The A. C. started on a
            scoring spree and led throughout the
            first three quarters to be tramped
            down in the last four minutes of play.
            Peterson led Taylor’s scoring with 20
            points and was by far the star on
            the floor. Arnold and Hagen of the
            Coca Colas were tie with 12 points
            each. The crowd was very disap-
            pointed to think a team like Taylor
            that seemed to be far the superior
            team, should taste the bitter weed of
            defeat by being beaten after leading
            by 29 to 12 at one stage in the game.
            We only hope they don’t misjudge the
            team enough to turn out and see us
            play again if we can get games with
            the Coca Cola team.
            TAYLOR 42-PINE CREEK 52
            Taylor traveled to Pine Creek Sun-
            day night and there met defeat by
            a score of 42 to 52. There we met
            the same sportsman team that played
            here on Tuesday night. We were
            outplayed there by a smooth passing
            attack and fast break under the bas-
            ket. The scoring was well divided up-
            on the Taylor team by Peterson,
            Skutley, Lambert getting 9, 8, and
            8 points respectively. Weise did the
            share of the Pine Creek scoring with
            22 points. The Taylor A. C. has en-
            tered the town team tournament at
            Osseo that will play there March 24,
            25 and 26. More details will follow
            next week.
            The Legion and Auxiliary Post 368

            Legion’s 20th birthday.

            C. M. Dunn home. Miss Ruth return-
            ed to her school duties Sunday while
            the others remained for a longer visit
            among relatives and friends.
            The Parish Junior League will
