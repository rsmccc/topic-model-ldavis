            Mrs. A. J. Rude is home from a
            visit with relatives in Wisconsin Ra-
            pids.
            Mrs. Hartig of Wrightsville, has
            been very sick at the home of her sis-
            ter, Mrs. Vincent, but is now better.
            Mrs. Gus Johnson and daughter
            spent several days in Chicago during
            the week and report that inside the
            city no snow is seen.
            Mrs. Nels Olson, son Orville and
            Mr. and Mrs. Volk, of Rhinelander,
            were at Sycamore for the funeral of
            their daughter and sister, Mrs. Syd
            Rose.
            Mrs. Irma Henderson, who spent a
            week with her sister, Mrs. Steams,
            returned to her home in Milwaukee
            Thursday, but will return and help
            care for her sister, who is up now and
            improving. Her son Billie, of Self-
            ridge Field, Mich., spent a few days
            here.
            The party at the high school Sat-
            urday evening to meet Dr. Boxer and
            wife, was well attended and a very
            interesting program given by the cit-
            izens responded to by the doctor in a
            pleasing manner. We are all glad to
            have him locate here and extend the
            right hand of fellowship to him and
            his wife.</p>
