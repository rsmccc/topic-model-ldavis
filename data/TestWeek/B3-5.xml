            1939 Soil Program
            Jackson county farmers can now
            use their prospective 1939 agricultu-
            ral conservation payments as security
            for the purchase of lime, fertilizer, or
            seed needed this season in carrying
            out approved soil-building practices.
            Loans will be made by the Farm
            Security Administration to farmers
            who would otherwise be unable to
            earn payments under the soil-build-
            ing phases of the 1939 farm program.
            The loans are designed to help those
            who are unable to get credit from
            other sources with which to pay for
            the necessary soil-building materials.
            Arlie Mucks, state director of the
            Farm Security Administration, and
            Robert Schultz, of the state agricul-
            tural conservation committee, report
            that applicaions for loans will be
            handled through the county agricultu-
            ral conservation office.
            Loans will be based upon the es-
            timated 1939 farm payment, Mucks
            and Schultz indicate. These payments
            are determined by the worked-out
            farm plans which all co-operators in
            the program are signing this spring.
            A loan cannot exceed 60 per cent of
            the possible benefit payment.
            Notes covering the loans will be
            payable on December 1, 1939 or
            when payment is made by the agri-
            cultural adjustment administration
            for performance under the 1939 pro-
            gram. Interest is at the rate of 5
            per cent during the period of the
            oan.
            Security for the notes is covered
            by an assignment of the 1939 pay-
            ment to the Farm Security Adminis-
            tration. Borrowers must agree to
            use the full amount cf the loan for
            the purchase of soil-building materi-
            als approved under the agricultural
            conservation program.
            Officials of the Farm Security Ad-
            ! ministration announce that loans for
            the purchase of seed, lime and fertil-
            izers will not be available in the
            county offices until Monday, March
            20th.
