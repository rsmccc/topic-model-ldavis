            Economic Crisis in Germany Forces 'Now or Never' Choice
            by Joseph W. La Blue
            
            Germany
            In 1939 economic poverty can
            throttle the most warlike nation, be-
            cause modern conflict needs man-
            power tar less than gunpowder, air-
            planes and battleships. Moreover,
            foreign trade has become a vital
            weapon of diplomacy. When Adolf
            Hitler first reached power he could
            import and use the raw materials
            of war by capitalizing on his inheritance from democratic government. Commodities, a huge reserve
            of unused capital, equipment and
            unemployed labor helped build the
            Third Reich's military machine.
            Other millions went for costly pub-
            lic works to impress the world with
            Germany’s prowess. Meanwhile
            heavy imports cut the Reich's foreign exchange to a reported 800,-
            000,000 marks by January 1 this
            year, while Germany's moral stock
            foil on the world market thanks to
            Jewish persecution and the Czech
            crisis. Barter trade (swapping) was
            a desperate and unpopular recourse
            to combat the mare orthodox type of
            agreement like America's reciprocal program.
            Among typical German signs-of-
            the-times:
            Twenty-nine per cent of the
            national income goes to the state
            via taxes; 10 per cent more reach
            the Reich’s coffers via social insurance and enforced donations. Of the
            basic 20 per cent, 25 goes for re-
            armament.
            Total tax revenue for this
            fiscal year (excluding Austria and
            Sudeten land) will be $8,(130,000,000;
            miscellaneous income, $80,000,000;
            income via long and short term borrowing, $4,800,000,000: the rough to-
            tal income, $14. Today’s
               public debt stands at between 21
               and 24 billions, far larger in pro-
               portion than the bemoaned U. S.
               public debt.
               Minus cash, the Reich has paid
               armament makers $400,000,000 in I.
               O. U.'s since November 1. Bearing
               no interest, half of them have gone
               back to banks as collateral for loans.
               Result:	A completely artificial
               credit structure which could collapse
               overnight
               Chief worrier about this impossible situation has been Dr. Rudolf
               Brinkman, successor as Reiehsbnnk
               president to Dr. Hjalmar Schacht.
               On the job a few weeks, Dr. Brink-
               man worried himself into a nervous
               breakdown. Meanwhile developments reveal that Dr. Schacht was
               not kicked out of the Reichsbank
               into disfavor, but to tackle the job
               Adoif Hitler had in mind when he
               told the Reichstag January 30 that
               Germany "must export or die." A
               financial wizard who has more
               friends abroad than any other influential Nazi, Dr. Schacht is now in
               charge of a campaign to revive for-
               eign trade by (1) seeking new mar-
               kets to provide additional foreign
               exchange, and (2) thawing out frozen debits and credits created under
               the Nazi system.
               The significance of this situation
               to that France and Britain, now
               weaker than Germany in military
               might, will eventually be stronger
               'by virtue of superior financial re-
               serves. Without batting an eyelash,
               London la spending more than
               $3,000,009,000 for defense nest year
               and can continue at this pace for
               several years to come. Germany
               must get foreign exchange immediately or stop rearming, and Britain
               is now waging an aggressive and
               successful campaign to block the
               Reich's trade expansion plans.
               On# very important reason why
               observers predict a European show-
               down this spring is that the Reich
               must strike now—while her might is
               still supreme—or suffer eventual
               diplomatic defeat. Moreover this
               economic supremacy of world democracies will have the same effect
               on dictatorial Italy and Japan.
               Congress
               Most Americans do not realize
               that the bulk of New Deal reform
               measures have been adopted in one
               form or another. But practically
               everyone realizes the cost of re-
               form has been tremendous, that the
               public debt now stands at $40,000,-
               000,000, that the treasury has a cur-
               rent deficit of $2,200,000,000. With re-
               form achieved. President Roosevelt
               is willing to join conservatives in
               two mutually desired ambitions, balancing the budget and helping business get back on its feet.
               Chief arguments concern the
               method. New Dealers, whose pro-
               gram is voiced by Secretary of Commerce Harry Hopkins, would re-
               move oppressive taxes and hope
               that the resultant boom would swell
               federal coffers, balancing the budget without eliminating “necessary"
               activities. Most businessmen and
               many congressmen would take an
               additional step—economy.
               Total 1939-40 budget estimates are
               $8,995 000,000, creating a new $3,326,-
               000,000 deficit and zooming the pub-
               lic debt smack against its legal
               debt limit of $45,000.000.000—unless
               congress raises the limit. Far from
               willing to raise it, or even to approve the new budget, congressional
               Republicans have found strong sup-
               port in rebellious Democrats. Their
               spokesman is Mississippi's Sen. Pat
               Harrison, who came nut for a fiat
               10 per cent budget cut and a warn-
               ing: “The country’s credit is good
               and I don’t think we have reached
               the debt danger point, but the stop-
               look-and-listen sign is up A lot
               of this emergency stuff could be cut,
               and I'm in favor of cutting."
               Senator Harrison has already
               found support in two studies:
               Brookings. Surveying the new governmental reorganization bill (to
               consolidate and abolish executive
               agencies for the sake of economy
               and efficiency), Washington's thorough-searching Brookings institution
               claimed it was ill-conceived, that no
               economies would result. Of 132
               agencies listed for reorganization,
               only 54 require legislative authority,
               and no legislation is necessary un-
               less congress wants to “give the
               President authority to make laws
               by executive order.’1 Suggestions:
               (1) Prune ail present activities "rigorously;” develop a “more con-
               sistent” program.
               National Economy League, Reason for this survey was that "before
               lasting recovery and increased employment can be a reality all
               doubts about national credit must be
               removed. The plan: Reduce next
               year's deficit from $3,000,000,000 to
               $500,000,060. Comparative budgets
               So potent are economy' new

               well find its cautious business-woo-
               ing program a.boomerang. Wading
               half way across the pond of concilia-
               tion when opinion favored a complete passage, Mr, Roosevelt has 
               been left behind and confronted with
               charges of insincerity because Harry Hopkins-—the man who started I
               his program—would need business
               support to win the 1940 nomination,
               India
               Vast India is at once Great Brit-
               ain's most precious and troublesome
               colony, partly because Indians lack
               the ability to rule themselves, partly because a few native leaders realize Britain gets much mom from
               the provinces then she return*. Mohandas K. Gandhi has been the lead-
               ing native agitator, winning a shallow victory whoa the home rule constitution established 000 native sovereigns who have absolute power
               over their subjects but moat bow to
               the it provincial governors. Work-
               ing hopefully, Gandhi’s party congress now holds a meaningless majority in eight provinces.
               Fasting to Leader Gandhi's favorite meant of forcing reforms. Since
               September of 1932 he has tried it
               six times, most recently in the native state of Rajkot. Reason: The
               29-year-old Thakore of Rajkot promised last December to grant new
               powers to his subjects, but had not
               fulfilled the promise. After four
               days of fasting the aged Gandhi
               was weakening fast and the Indian
               viceroy expected to intervene.
               But the fast held food for thought
               in Britain, already busy with enough
               troubles. For the first time Gand-
               hi's party had enough strength to
               precipitate major trouble through-
               out the state, had the marquess
               failed to intervene. Even if the cur-
               rent outbreak of nationalism is settled, Gandhi's followers will obviously gain strength.
               Religion
               As Eugenio Cardinal PaceUi, Pope
               Pius XII was Vatican secretary of
               state and an important mediator in
               many a European squabble. His
               two most notable achievements
               were (1) leadership in the World
               war settlement attempt of Pope
               Benedict XV and (2) consummation
               of the concordat that brought peace
               between the Vatican and Italy. His
               most difficult job was negotiating a
               treaty with Protestant Russia in
               1929, a feat that won him the red
               cap of cardinal when Pietro Gas-
               parri retired in 1929.
               When Pope Pius XI died last Feb-
               ruary 9, Secretary of State PaceUi
               immediately became camerlengo,
               interim chief of the Roman Catholic
               church until the college of cardinals
               could name a successor. Internationally better known than any other
               potential candidate. Cardinal Pacellt's name was immediately bandied
               about as the most likely successor.
               This, despite his confessed longing
               to lead the contemplative life of a
               monk, despite rumors that his selection would be none too welcome
               by totalitarian Germany and Italy.
               If Cardinal PaceUi had never ad-
               mitted anti-dictator sentiments,
               Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano’s newspaper, II Telegrafo, lost
               no time pointing out that a PaceUi
               appointment would be unwelcome
               in Rome. In Germany another
               newspaper, Das Schwarze (Corps,
               chimed in. At the Vatican, German
               Ambassador Carl-Ludwig Diego von
               Bergen told the college that his nation was "assisting at the elaboration of a new world,” and that "the
               papacy without doubt has an essential role.”
               Though conceivably unrelated to
               these events. Cardinal Pacelli’s elevation to the papacy might be in
               direct retaliation against two governments which saw fit to interfere
               with church affairs. A further possibility is that the Rome-Berlln axis
               erred diplomatically to such an ex-
               tent that the college of cardinals
               felt obliged to appoint an experienced statesman who could deal
               with Herr Hitter and Signor Mussolini.
               
               Spain
               The spectre of two simultaneous
               Spanish civil wars is unique, but
               not unexpected. Since Barcelona
               fell and President Manuel Azana re-
               signed upon breaking with Premier
               Juan Negrin, Loyalists have been
               threatened by internal dlssention.
               On the defensive more than aver
               before, conservatives sought desperately to regain the Anglo-French favor that was shifting to victorious
               General Franco and hi* Insurgents,
               meanwhile making sincere gestures
               to end the war. Premier Negrin
               and the Communist element, fear-
               ing the consequences of surrender,
               promised a futile "fight to the
               death" winch would serve no purpose since a Franco victory was in-
               evitable, In the long-awaited ex-
               plosion conservative Loyalists seized
               the goverment, drove Negrin from power and paved the way for peace.
