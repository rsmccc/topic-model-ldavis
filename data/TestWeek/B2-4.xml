         <p>POSTAL REGULATIONS REGARDING CIRCULAR MAILING
            Some persons having permits to
            mail matter in bulk under section
            562, P. L. and R., present advertising
            matter in the form of large, unfolded
            printed sheets addressed for distribu-
            tion to box holders on rural and star
            routes. Since it is necessary to fold
            such large sheets before they can be
            distributed or placed in the boxes, the
            handling thereof may delay delivery
            of all other mail on the route.
            In view of the considerable saving
            in postage obtained by mailing adver-
            tising matter in bulk under section
            562, and the convenience to the mail-
            ers of the simplified box-holder form
            of address, it is expected that mail-
            ers will fold matter to a reasonable
            size.
            Postmasters will please take this
            up with mailers who present matter
            of this kind and request that future
            mailings be folded to a size conveni-
            ent for handling, preferably not larg-
            er than 9 to 12 inches.</p>
