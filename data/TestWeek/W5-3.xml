         <p>IN MEMORIAM In memory of our beloved mother, Mrs. William Burger,
            who passed away one year ago, March 6. Our precious mother from us
            has gone, A voice we loved is stilled; A place is vacant in our
            home. Which never ran be filled. God in HIs wisdom has recalled The
            gift His love has given. And though the body slumbers here Her soul
            is safe in Heaven. Sadly missed by William Burger, Robert Burger,
            Mr. and Mrs. Peter Esker and Children.</p>
