         <p>Household Questions
            Conversations Made Easy Keep
            the center of the room free from
            furniture. This makes for easy
            conversation across the room.
            
            Sweeten Coffee Pot If the
            morning coffee seems to have lost
            its pep, perhaps toe pot needs attention. Scald it at least once a
            week—twice is better. Purify for
            an hour or longer directly in the
            sunlight.
            
            Shine Off Serge.—The shine on
            the dark serge suit can be re-
            moved to a certain extent by
            sponging with vinegar and then
            pressing in the usual way.
            
            For Baby's Bath.—A good soap
            substitute, if the baby has sensitive skin, is a pound of oatmeal or
            a quart of bran, tied securely in a
            gauze bag and allowed to soak
            in the bath water.
            
            Sewing Tip. — Before mending
            with new darning wool hold it in
            the steam of a kettle for a few
            minutes and let it slowly dry. This
            shrinks it so it will not "pull" or
            pucker when the mended garment
            is washed.
            
            Picture Frame Tips.—Any picture frame which detracts from
            the picture is wrong. It should
            be as Inconspicuous as possible,
            blending with the color of the wall
            against which it is hung. How-
            ever, Chinese and Japanese prints
            may be placed in lacquered
            frames which blend with one of
            the colors in the picture.</p>
