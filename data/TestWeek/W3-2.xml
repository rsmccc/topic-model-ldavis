         <p>Mother Earth Still Better Timekeeper than the Best Clocks, Astronomer Says
            Notwithstanding that observations
            and calculations of astronomers 
            have proved that actually the moon
            Is six seconds off its predicted
            course, notes a writer in the New
            York Times, Dr. H. Spencer Jones,
            the astronomer royal, explains that
            the earth is still a better timekeeper
            than the best clocks He added
            "However, we hope that a clock
            we are experimenting with will
            prove a better timekeeper even
            than the earth."
            In a report to the board of visitors
            at Greenwich observatory, the astronomer royal said
            "It used to be assumed that the
            rotation of the earth was absolutely
            invariable, but of recent years it
            has been found that the earth s
            timekeeping does vary.
            “To say that the moon itself is
            off its course is to repeat a common
            error—actually it is off its predicted
            course. Deviations to the rotation
            of the earth mere previously suspected, but not confirmed until recently.
            "The discovery was made by de
            tailed investigation of the motion of
            the sun, Venus, Mercury and Mars.
            In the case of these bodies it was
            found that there was also a deviation, though smaller in amount,
            "The moon being off Us course
            means that the earth’s time is
            wrong because the cause of the
            moon altering its predicted position
            is the slowing down of the rotation
            at the earth
            "This may be caused by tidal friction, or a contributory factor might
            be a land upheaval occurring some
            where like the Siberian plateau, the
            attraction of the sun or perturbation by planets such as Mars and
            Venus,
            “The earth Is slowing down by
            about  part of a second a
            century. This means it is losing
            time of about two hours every 2,000
            years.
            “Eventually the days will become
            much longer but this will not be for
            thousands of years, probably until
            after human life is extinct from the
            earth.”
