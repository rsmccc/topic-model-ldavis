         <p>FIRST ANNUAL
            BULL SALE
            At the John Wuethrich farm 1 mile
            south and V6 mile east of Greenwood
            or Vs mile northwest of Wuethrich’s
            Creamery on Saturday, March 18th,
            1939. Sale to start promptly at 1:00
            P. M.
            18 Pure Bred Holstein Bulls; 11
            bulls from 8 months to 12 months old,
            7 bulls from 4 weeks to 5 months old.
            These bulls are sired by my two herd
            sires and are out of our very best
            pure bred cows that have been in
            testing associations the past two
            years, ranging from 250 to 420 lbs. of
            butterfat per year during the last 2
            seasons. Our cows received no grain
            while on pasture and were really
            handicapped. The sires of these bulls
            are two of the best in the state.
            Herd Sire No. 1—Colony George
            Sir Heilo is out of the great all
            American-Canadian cow Colony Flood
            Colantha. She has 5 yearly records,
            the highest 9S0.00 lbs. His sire’s dam
            has 1166.25 lbs. as a 3-yr.-old. His
            calves are exceptionally nice and
            should make real herd bulls.
            Herd Sire No. 2—Quonquont Sir
            Modest 44th, an eastern bred sire who
            at this time has 19 sisters at 2-yr.-olds
            that made from 600 to 944 lbs. but-
            terfat in 1 yr. testing 3.92.
            At this time I have 12 cows on test
            in my barn and we hope to have at
            least a few 1000 lb. butter cows or
            800 lb. butterfat cows. Some of these
            sires will be worth considerable more
            after these cows finish their records.
            Remember you can’t breed good cows
            by using poor bulls. I have a bull to
            suit everybody’s pocketbook. There
            are 15 pure bred bulls and 3 out of
            high butterfat grade cows in this lot.
            If you need a good bull be sure to
            attend this sale and buy one at your
            own price. Usual terms of sale.
