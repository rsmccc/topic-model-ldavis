         <p>At 70, Britain's Chamberlain Reviews Life's Busiest Year
            Whether the public
            likes it or not, Britain’s
            Prlme Minister Neville
            Chamberlain hat triad
            desperately to main tala
            world peace v la the conference table method.
            On March 18 he will end
            his seventieth—and most
            eventful — year. Right 
            Mr. Chamberlain startled
            the world September 14
            by paying a precedent-
            shattering call on Hitler
            ml Berchtesgaden. Photo
            shows him leaving Lon-
            don, flying for the first
            time. Below: The second
            meeting, at Codesberg,
            on September 22.
            Then came Munich.
            On September 30 Mr.
            Chamberlain returned
            home to read this
            document at Heston
            airdrome, London. He
            had also signed a pact
            with Germany, Italy
            end France.
            But the policy of appeasement” bore suscplous fruit. Following
            Munich, Germany end
            Italy appeared planning
            new demands against
            France and Britain.
            Preparing for a declaration of democratic
            solidarity, Mr. Chamberlain and Ixtrd Halifax,
            his foreign minister, visited Paris on November
            24. Below On January
            10 he again stopped in
            Palis en route to Rome.

            Minister Georges Bonnet
            Mr. Chamberlain, Premier Edouard Daladier 
            and Fiscount Halifax. 
            Next day, January II,
            Mr. Chambarlain mrrired in Rome to visit
            Mussolini. The trip seas
            heralded as another "appeasement'” mission from 
            which a new totalitarian
            victory could be expected. but nothing happened. Mr. Chamberlain 
            may have gained nothing
            but he tried to break down the growing barriers between the peoples of Europe.</p>
