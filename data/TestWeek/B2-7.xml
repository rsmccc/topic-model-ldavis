         <p>ATTENTION IS CALLED
            Speaking of calling attention we
            would like to call some to the re-
            freshing viewpoint of the Galesville
            Republican in re taxes. To say the
            least it is out of the ordinary. And
            there is considerable food for thought
            in the following editorial.
            Why Should Tax Payment Be
            Distasteful
            Calling attention to the recent act
            of the state legislature in providing
            for an extension in payment of real
            estate taxes to July 1, the Wonewoc
            Reporter starts off by saying‚Äî‚ÄúEx-
            cuse us for bringing up this distaste-
            ful subject‚, and then goes on to ex-
            plain.
            The Republican protests the Re-
            porters expression.
            Why should taxes be a distasteful
            subject?
            Why, any more than payment of
            rent, electric, water, gas, phone, or
            any other bills?
            Taxes are to pay for something for
            which the taxpayer has had value re-
            ceived.
            In Galesville or any other similar
            community were there no taxes there
            would be no schools, no public build-
            ings, no pavement, no street lights,
            no parks, no water or sewer system,
            no fire department, no police, gar-
            bage removal, no band concerts, no
            public library, nor many other things
            which now go to make for better liv-
            ing.
            And as for taxes to pay essentials,
            that old saying of Ben Franklin that
            we are taxed by ourselves thrice as
            much for our follies as we pay to the
            public treasury, still holds good.
            In a recent column, Upton Sinclair,
            noted writer, said:
            All taxes are unpopular. They are
            negative measures, reducing the peo-
            ples spending power. Of course, the
            poor are willing to tax the rich, so
            we have income and inheritance
            taxes. The old are willing to tax
            the young, so we have the Townsend
            plan and the ‚ÄúHam and Eggs‚ pro-
            position. But nobody is willing to
            tax himself, and these proposals fail
            at the polls because so many of our
            people are still taxpayers.‚</p>
