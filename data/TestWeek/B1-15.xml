         <p>There was a meeting of the Jack-
            son County Safety committee held j
            Monday afternoon in the office of the
            county highway commissioner. Those
            present were Mrs. A. P. Jones, Miss I
            Grace Webb, O. H. Overlien, Bert F. j
            Johnson and Merlin Horswill. A. R. I
            Gunnison, state traffic officer from
            Eau Claire, was present and spoke on
            his varied experiences as traffic of-
            ficer in 11 counties and made sugges-
            tions and recommendations. Several
            matters were taken up before the
            meeting. Miss Webb read replies to
            inquiries sent village schools as to
            what they thought regarding safety j
            measures.
            Traffic Officer Bemie Finch was I
            cruising along north of Merrillan >
            early Sunday morning a short dis- ;
            tance behind a Hennepin Transfer !
            trick driven by Morris Thompson. He l
            turned out to pass a car, the truck j
            struck the soft shoulder of the road j
            and overturned, pinning the driver |
            between the steering wheel and a
            heavy box of freight. It was neces- j
            sary to get a bar to pry him loose j
            from his precarious position. For-
            tunately he was not injured much. |
            and suffered no broken bones. He :
            was carrying a load of heavy freight j
            from Chicago to Minneapolis.
            Jack Xeindorp, who has been in the
            Hancock Hardware store since its or-
            ganization here, left Sunday for Mil-
            waukee to take up his new duties ;
            with the Pittsburg Plate Glass Com- i
            pany. His family is remaining here
            for the present.
            Mrs. Anna Segan of Kansas City, j
            was here on business yesterday.</p>
