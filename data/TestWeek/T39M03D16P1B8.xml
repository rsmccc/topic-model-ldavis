         <p>Leon Hackney Gets Lead in College Play
            Leon Hackney, Tomah boy attending Carroll College, has been given the lead in the all-school play, “Dear Brutus,” which will be staged within the next few weeks. The play is considered an advanced piece of dramatics and the honor of a position in the cast is something to be sought by any student. Leon’s Tomah friends will be glad to hear of his selection in this play.
