         <p>MYRICK A. CHAPMAN
            We are indebted to Wm. Seymour,
            of Minneapolis for the following clip-
            ping regarding a former resident.
            Mr. Chapman was a son of Leander
            H. Chapman, of Pleasant View, and
            was well known here.
            Rites for Myrick A. Chapman, 56,
            905 Fourteenth avenue S., will be
            at 2 p. m. Tuesday at Gill Brothers?
            Mortuary. Burial in Crystal Lake
            cemetery.
            Born in Jackson county, Wisconsin,
            he had lived in Minneapolis 35 years.
            Surviving are three sisters, Marie
            of Chicago; Mrs. Francis Kilpatrick,
            of Pittsburg, Kan.; and Mrs. C. M.
            Hill, of Minneapolis.</p>
