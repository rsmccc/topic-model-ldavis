         <p>Libraries Need Aid
            State Aid for libraries is an annual
            fund appropriated by the state and
            used to supplement local funds to establish public libraries in areas now
            without them and to extend and im-
            prove the service of existing libraries
            Why Wisconsin libraries need state
            aid:
            30 per cent of the population of the
            entire state is without local public library service.
            40 per cent of the population, excluding Milwaukee county, has no lo-
            cal library service.
            A large proportion of the population which now has access to libraries
            is poorly served because the cost of
            adequate library service is more than
            some communities can support.
            $.44 a year is the average per capita
            expenditure for library service in Wisconsin from local appropriations. The
            minimum national standard is $1.
            Wisconsinâ€™s expenditure is more than
            50 per cent below standard.
            Libraries are of primary importance
            in all adult education programs and
            provide the only free source of material for those who continue to study after leaving school.
            Libraries are an integral part of
            the educational system and arguments
            which support state aid for schools
            are equally applicable for library aid.
            What state aid will do for Wisconsin libraries:
            It will stimulate the establishment
            and growth of local libraries, thereby
            decreasing the percentage of people
            lacking access to the free use of books.
            It will tend to equalise library sup-
            port in leas prosperous areas without
            decreasing support in communities
            now sewed.
