            MUSIC NEWS
            A group of 7th and 8th grade boys
            have formed an octette. The mem-
            bers are Art Johnson, Carl Malchow,
            Donald Larson, Don Holder, Hugh
            Trask, Dean Allison, George Pauley
            and Robert Waldum. They asked
            Miss Keefe to practice with them.
            They are practicing “The Vagabond”,
            ‘The Dove”, and “Keep in de Middle
            ob de Road.”
            The band and orchestra mothers
            purchased a new lyre for the school.
            The mixed chorus will make its
            first appearance Sunday. They have
            a lot of new music and we hope we
            will hear more of them.
            Mr. Edelbeck’s photography class is
            coming along very well. They have
            been enlarging and developing films.
            THE HOBBY SHOW
            Most of you will remember the
            Hobby show which was sponsored by
            the high school last year. It was a
            huge success with any number of in-
            teresting hobbies displayed.
            This year, some time in April, an-
            other Hobby Show will be held in the
            high school auditorium. All efforts
            are being made to make it even big-
            ger and better than last year’s show.
            Entries from many parts of the coun-
            ty, together with those from the city,
            will do much to make this coming
            event one to be remembered.
            So if you have a hobby, get busy
            and prepare it to be entered in the
            show. Tell your friends about it too.
            It is our hope to have every entry of
            last year back again, plus many new
            ones.
            Watch the Banner-Journal and
            Oriole for further details of the 1939
            Hobby Show.

            Clifford Lowe, endowed with great
            artistic ability, has drawn the best
            cover design for the annual of 1939,
            and thereby will receive his “Breeze”
            free. The Breeze staff decided to
            have the cover in the school colors,
            Black and Orange. Won’t that be</p>
