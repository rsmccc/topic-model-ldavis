         <p>MRS. SAM BURTON
            Mrs. Sam Burton, mother of Claude
            Burton, of this city, made her home
            here for some time with her son.
            Friends will be sorry to learn of her
            death. She fell at her home, broke
            her hip, and pneumonia followed, re-
            sulting in her death.
            The following account of her life
            is taken from the Tri-County News.
            Selina G. Burton was born on Dec-
            ember 29, 1852, in Eagle, Waukesha
            county, Wisconsin, to parents, Albert
            and Susan Green.
            She spent the early years of her
            life at home. She was united in mar-
            riage to Samuel Burton, October 11,
            1873. To this union were born five
            children, three of whom have preced-
            ed her in death, namely Adelbert,
            Lewis and Orval.
            They resided in Waukesha county
            for 11 years, and then moved to Ar-
            cadia and resided here also for 11
            years after which they moved to a
            farm near Strum, moving to Strum
            in 1905.
            Mr. Burton passed away April 8,
            1933. Mrs. Burton has lived in her
            home and was actively engaged in her
            work until a short time before her
            death.
            She passed away after a short
            illness on Wednesday evening, March
            1, 1939, at the age of 86 years.
            She leaves to mourn her departure
            one daughter Leona (Mrs. J. M. Ol-
            son), Strum; and one son, Claude, of
            Black River Falls. Two brothers, Al-
            bert and Charlie, and one sister, Car-
            oline, preceded her in death. She also
            leaves one sister Ellen (Mrs. Phil
            Richard), of Eagle, Wisconsin.
            Funeral services were conducted
            Saturday, March 4, at 1:30 p. m. at
            the home and 2:00 p. m. at the West
            Beef River church. Rev. N. A. Bemt-
            son officiating. Interment was in the
            church cemetery.
            Those from out of town who at-
            tended the funeral were:	Mrs.	Ella
            Bets, Mrs. Carrie Cruber and Mr.
            and Mrs. Will Knight of Eagle, Wis.;
            Mr. and Mrs. Knute Jacobson and
            Mrs. Ole Myhers and son Jack, of
            Eau Claire; Mr. and Mrs. Melvin
            Bergerson, of Osseo; Clark Burton,
            Purdue, Ind; Claude Burton, of B.
            R. Falls.
            F. J. Bowman went to Sparta Sat-
            urday accompanied by Teadaman
            Hanson and Charlie Savage and sold
            a carload of Canadian horses that had
            been shipped there by Redmond
            Walsh, of Alberta, Canada. They
            were a nice lot of horses, from 2 to
            6 years old, weighing from 1100 to
            1300 pounds mostly, and were eager-
            ly accepted by a good crowd of en-
            thusiastic buyers. The 20 horses and
            colts sold for approximately $1600.00
            or an average of $80.00 per head,
            several went over the $100.00 mark,
            which was very pleasing to the own-
            er Mr. Walsh, as it was his first ship-
            ment of horses into the United States.
            He went home rejoicing and has en-
            gaged Mr. Bowman to sell 200 more
            horses now on his ranch in Alberta,
            to be shipped to various places in the
            United States in the near future.</p>
