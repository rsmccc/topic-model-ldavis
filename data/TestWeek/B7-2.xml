         <p>ALMA CENTER SCHOOLS
            The G. A. A. gave a sleigh-ride
            party for the girls in high school Fri-
            day night. About 25 girls attended.
            A good time was had by all. The
            group was chaperoned by Miss Ker-
            ke and Miss Courtier.
            Alma Center was the winner of the
            consolation prize at basket ball tour-
            nament last week. This tournament
            was the final play of the season.
            The 6th and 7th grades are begin-
            ning a series of lessons on courtesy.
            We have had our first lesson on ta-
            ble etiquette and will start on intro-
            ductions next week.
            Maurice Van Gilder is back in
            school after a two weeks absence.
            The pupils of the primary and in-
            termediate rooms were entertained at
            a sliding party Monday night by Miss
            Betty Winslow and Miss Kathryn
            Krebsbach. Refreshments were serv-
            ed in the gym.
            Alma Center High school closed its
            1938-39 basket ball season by copping
            consolation honors of the Class C
            tournament held at Whitehall March
            1-4.
            In the first game of the tourney
            the local five could not cope with
            the Independence reserve strength
            and after putting up a stiff fight for
            two quarters, found the Trempealeau
            Valley champions gradually pull away
            to a 30 to 15 victory.
            The first game played on Thursday
            evening paired the Alma Center five
            with the Arkansaw entry from the
            Mondovi district. The Arkansaw zone
            defense offered very little competition
            and Alma Center easily won a place
            in the consolation finals with a 37 to
            8 victory.
            On Saturday evening in a six min-
            ute quarter affair, Hixton High school
            went down to defeat by a score of
            22 to 17 and Alma Center was in pos-
            session of the consolation champion-
            ship for the third consecutive year.
            Four seniors, Wayne Nolop, Har-
            vey Krueger, Kenneth Smith and Ev-
            erett Thayer made their last appear-
            ance as members of the Alma Center
            team.
            About 20 Alma Center High school
            girls attended the Puff-Pant prom at
            Merrillan Friday, March 10th. The
            girls enjoyed the party very much.</p>
