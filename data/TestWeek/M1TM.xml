         <p>How! He-chalk-kolo! meaning, Hello, friend!  “Hump-day-a, Hump-la-pin” mean­ing “ Today is a fine day.” 
Learn to talk Winnebago Indian language by following this column each week? Why not? 
The whites have taught us Redskins their language so turn about is fair play. 
Every white reader should talk to some extent the Indian language of their community, not that it will get you anywhere in the world, 
but merely for the fun of it. The English language is not my mother tongue, so I have lots of fun juggling the English words 
and arranging them in such a way that it sounds like something. John Marsh, our recent retired businessman, talks very good Indian 
and knows the meaning o f many Indian names for different kinds of dry goods.
“Pale face” Carish o f the I. G. A. store, talks fairly good Indian too. But when it comes to talking the 
Winnebago language, the late Werner brothers, Art and Bob, of this city, were way above the average. And then there were 
and are many great friends of the Winnebagoes who do not speak a word of Indian. Take the late surgeon and physician, 
Eugene Krohn, and Judge Frank Johnson, for examples.  It is quite probable these true friends of the Redmen never had 
the leisure time to learn. Now there are County Judge Harry Perry and Mr. Berg of the jewelry store, and many others 
who do not talk one word of Indian except to say How! 
Next week we’ll have the first part of Scout law of the Boy Scouts in Winnebago language. </p>
