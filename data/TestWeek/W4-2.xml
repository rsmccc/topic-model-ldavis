            on St. Patrick
            Although this well beloved persononage is the patron Saint of Ireland.
            St. Patrick was born in Scotland or
            possibly in England. HIs life seems
            to readers of modern times most romantic and adventurous. At the ago
            of 16 he was captured by pirates from
            Ireland and carried to that island,
            where for six years he tended the
            flocks of an Ulster chieftain. During
            these years of his slavery, he became
            a devoted Christian, and after his escape to France, entered monastic life
            Directed by a vision to return as a
            missionary to Ireland, he obeyed the
            call In 432 and for the rest of his life
            worked zealously in various parts of
            the island. (St. Patrick’s return to
            Ireland in 432 is considered “The First
            Great Event” in the History of Ire-
            land). His labors were so miraculously successful that he came to be known
            as the one who “found Ireland all
            heathen and left It all Christian,“
            There he founded over 300 churches
            and he personally baptised over 12,000
            Naturally many legends grew up
            about the name of this popular saint,
            A favorite is the one which represents
            him as charming the snakes of Ireland
            by his music so they followed him to
            the sea shores, where they were driven
            into the water and drowned. Indeed,
            much that is told about Saint Patrick
            is little more than legendary. One
            relic credited to him, a four slded iron
            bell, is in the Museum of Arts and
            Sciences in Dublin.
            What is accepted without question
            is the date of his festival. AH over
            the world, wherever the Irish have
            penetrated, March 17 is celebrated as
            St. Patrick's feast day.
            Always in connection with Ireland
            we think of the shamrock, which is
            the the  national anthem A familiar
            poem says:
            “Theres! a dear little plant that grows
            in opriale—
            Twas St. Patrick himself sure that
            set it;
            And the sun on his labors with
            pleasure did smile.
            And with dew from his eye often wet
            it.
            It shines through the bog. through the
            marsh and the mireland
            And he called it the dear little Sham-
            rock of Ireland.

            When 56-year-old Pianist-Composer
            Percy Grainger stepped off a train in
            Wausau, Wisconsin, he wore no hat
            or overcoat, sported white ducks and
            an old brown jacket, carried an umbrella, a knapsack on his back. Be-
            cause it was police promptly
            ran him in. Composer Grainger fin-
            ally identified himself, explained that
            he dislikes heavy clothing, has not
            worn a hat in 20 years, carries an
            umbrella simply to keep snow out of
            his bushy hair.—Time Magazine for

            Limerick or a Mustard Plaster
            A lady — alas! and alack! —
            A cold in her chest did contract.
            With a stout mustard plaster
            She courted disaster.
            And burned all the skin off her back!
