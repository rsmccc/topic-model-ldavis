         <p>THANKS
            Something nice happened at the
            court house one day last week. Oliver
            Ristuben, clerk of circuit court, was
            given a happy surprise by his fellow
            workers in the building. They all
            chipped inas the saying is, and
            bought a hearing device for him.
            Everybody in the building was almost
            as happy about it as he was when it
            proved to work in his case. Seven-
            teen years ago, following an illness
            of a few weeks, he recovered with
            impaired hearing. It has been a great
            handicap, as it would to anyone, but
            he has carried on in spite of it. He
            asked us to put a small card of thanks
            in the paper so all who made the gift
            would know how deeply appreciative
            he is. We are overstepping in doing
            it, but hope he will forgive us. A
            small card of thanks does not ade-
            quately express the feeling he gave
            us when he told about it. He said
            that when he adjusts the machine and
            cuts through the wall of silence that ;
            usually surrounds him, the bitterness \
            falls away. His friends join in this I
            thanks to the thought which made the '
            gift possible.</p>
