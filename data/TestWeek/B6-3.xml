         <p>WOMAN’S CLUB
            At their meeting held Wednesday,
            Feb. 8, in the hotel, the members of
            the Woman’s club were privileged to
            hear Mrs. A. L. Murray, of Eau
            Claire, who spoke on the “Social
            Value of Motion Pictures”. Mrs.
            Murray took a course in that sub-
            ject at the University of Southern
            California last summer. In connec-
            tion with her work at the University
            Mrs. Murray was able to visit vari-
            ous moving picture studios and had
            interesting experiences to relate.
            Among others it was her privilege to
            attend a showing of a picture, given
            to a board of women before it was
            released to the public. She was also
            in attendance at the premiere of
            “Marie Antoinette” and told how the
            people stood outside the theatre to
            see the actors and actresses as they
            arrived.
            A group of members had dinner
            with Mrs. Murray preceding the
            meeting. She had spoken at the school
            in the afternoon, after which she was
            entertained at a tea given in her
            honor by Mrs. P. M. Chaimson.
            The Craft department of the Wo-
            man’s club met Tuesday, March 7th
            at the home of Mrs. Wm. Schunke,
            with Mrs. Ed Heineck as assistant
            hostess. Mrs. A. W. Heilsberg and
            Mrs. O. E. Wang presented a demon-
            stration on sewing hints and dress-
            making which proved to be a practi-
            cal benefit to the entire group. Mrs.
            Heilsberg had planned the program
            in such a way that every one could
            participate in the demonstration.
            There were twenty in attendance.</p>
