         <p>COMMON SENSE CONSERVATION
            By L. H. Kingston
            Governor Heils appointment of
            Mark Catlin, Sr., Appleton, to the
            conservation commission will meet
            with the general approval of sports-
            men in the northeastern part of the
            state and wherever else he is known.
            I do not know Mr. Catlin personally
            but his writings prove him to be a
            fine sportsman, an outdoorsman with
            years of experience and an angler
            who really knows his way around.
            He has represented Outagamie
            county as county conservation com-
            mitteeman and he was elected in 1936
            by the committeemen in his district
            to the executive council of the state
            conservation congress. He is popu-
            lar amoung fellow sportsmen.
            The casual observer will say that
            Mr. Catlins presence on the commis-
            sion should greatly benefit conserva-
            tion in Wisconsin, but I think his ap-
            pointment has much more signific-
            ance than that.
            Study the personnel of the con-
            servation commission over recent
            years and you will notice that lum-
            bermen, resort owners and commer-
            citl fishermen always have had their
            representatives on the commission,
            which is as it should beâ€š but do you
            see anybody who might be considered
            as representing hunters, fishermen,
            and conservationists? No, the fel-
            lows who pay a large part of the con-
            servation bills in this state have not
            been represented at all; instead, poli-
            ticians and party wheelhorses have
            been receiving the lions share of the
            appointments.
            If Mr. Catlins meritous appoint-
            ment marks the end of the pay-off of
            political obligations by appointments
            on the conservation commission, I
            think that sportsmen and conserva-
            tionists will extend to Governor Heil
            their vote of thanks.
            Misses Loraine and June Taylor
            entertained friends at their home on
            Thursday evening. They spent the
            evening playing Chinese checkers and
            lunch was served.</p>
