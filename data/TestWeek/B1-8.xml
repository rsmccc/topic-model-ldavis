         <p>WE RAISE BIG LEMONS
            The prize lemon brought from Flo-
            rida recently and presented to Mr.
            and Mrs. William Ball, has nothing on
            what Jackson county can produce.
            A. W. Helwig of Alma Center, has a
            16-year-old lemon tree in the Jackson
            County Bank at Alma Center, which
            ! matured four lemons this month, two
            of which were 12 inches, in circum-
            ference and weighed onq pound and
            four ounces each, and the other two
            were a little over one half as large.
            Mrs. Helwig made two pics from one
            of the lemons, and one of the smaller
            ones is still on the tree. The tree at
            present is covered with blossoms, and i
            bids fair to outdo the 1939 crop the
            coming season. Several years ago
            Mr. Helwig had a lemon that measur-
            ed 13 x/i inches from this same tree.
            Mr. Helwig thinks people might be in-
            terested in knowing they do not have
            to go to Florida to see large lemons
            growing on a tree. All you have to
            do is come to Jackson county.</p>
